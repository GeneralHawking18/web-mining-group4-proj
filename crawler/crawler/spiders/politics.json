Trump tried to convince Vos that the ruling should apply retroactively, which Vos told him was not possible.</p> <p class=\"\">Vos' refusal to try to throw out the election results led Trump to campaign against his re-election.

The House was called to order at noon and the chamber moved to the first order of business: electing the speaker.</p> <p class=\"\">But there was no favorite for the job. Twenty-one candidates received votes for speaker on the first ballot, with none getting the majority needed. \u201cThere was no choice,\u201d the Congressional Globe <a href=\"https://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&amp;fileName=039/llcg039.db&amp;recNum=4\">printed</a> that day. The House held three more unsuccessful votes for speaker that day before adjourning just after 2 p.m.</p> <p class=\"\">In the weeks that followed, the House was in gridlock as no candidate could clinch the votes needed. It wasn\u2019t until the 133rd ballot that Rep. Nathaniel Banks of Massachusetts was elected speaker of the House, defeating Rep. William Aiken of South Carolina by a <a href=\"https://history.house.gov/Historical-Highlights/1851-1900/The-longest-and-most-contentious-Speaker-election-in-its-history/\">vote of 103 to 100.</a></p> <p class=\"\">The date was <a href=\"https://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&amp;fileName=039/llcg039.db&amp;recNum=344\">Feb. 2, 1856</a>, two months after the first speaker vote.</p> <p class=\"\">The House concluded business that day by unanimously <a href=\"https://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&amp;fileName=039/llcg039.db&amp;recNum=345\">adopting a resolution</a> thanking the clerk for presiding \u201cduring the arduous and protracted contest for Speaker.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\"><strong>1923: The last time the speaker vote went multiple ballots\u00a0</strong></p> <p class=\"\">When the House gathered on Dec. 4, 1923, <a href=\"https://history.house.gov/People/Detail/13820\">Frederick Gillett </a>sought re-election as speaker. The Republican from Massachusetts had served in the role since 1919 and his party had maintained control of the chamber.</p> <p class=\"\">But after the first ballot, Gillett did not have the votes needed. Three more votes were held and each time enough Progressive Republicans supported other candidates, blocking Gillett from regaining the gavel.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cMr. Clerk, it seems entirely evident that no good purpose can be served by having another ballot tonight,\u201d Republican leader Nicholas Longworth <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bound-congressional-record/1923/12/03/house-section\">said on the floor</a> before the chamber adjourned that night.</p> <p class=\"\">At issue were rule changes that Progressive Republicans wanted. For two days, the group refused to budge and on a few ballots, the Democrats\u2019 nominee even led in the tally.</p> <p class=\"\">Longworth eventually <a href=\"https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1923/12/05/102058087.html?pageNumber=1\">struck a deal </a>with the progressives and on the ninth ballot, Gillett was re-elected speaker.</p> <p class=\"\">There have only been <a href=\"https://history.house.gov/People/Office/Speakers-Multiple-Ballots/\">14 instances</a> in congressional history where it took more than two ballots for a nominee to get a majority. The first 13 happened before the Civil War.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThe Civil War established this norm ... where the parties agreed to air their dirty laundry in caucus but then to coalesce around the party leader, whoever got a majority in caucus,\u201d said Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Charles Stewart, co-author of the book \u201cFighting for the Speakership: The House and the Rise of Party Government.\"</p> <p class=\"\"><strong>2013: Conservatives plot coup against Boehner</strong></p> <p class=\"\">In 2013, the tea party movement that had swept Ohio Republican John Boehner into the speaker\u2019s office turned on Boehner himself.</p> <p class=\"\">A band of 20 conservative rebels \u2014 furious that Boehner had ousted some of them from committees and cut a fiscal deal that raised taxes on the wealthy \u2014 huddled in a Capitol Hill apartment the night before the speaker\u2019s vote and plotted a coup against their own leader, according to author Tim Alberta's book, \u201cAmerican Carnage.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Among those in the room were Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, and Tim Huelskamp, R-Kansas, Alberta writes. Republicans had won 234 seats in the 2012 election; if 17 Republicans opposed Boehner, they argued, conservatives could prevent him from getting the 218 votes he needed to remain speaker.</p> <p class=\"\">But some suspected there were Boehner spies in the room, and the conservatives began pointing fingers at each other, according to Alberta. Labrador said they actually needed to secure 30 dissenters because Boehner would surely be able to flip some of those no votes, telling the group, \"We need 30 to get to 17 because half of the people in this room are going to cave tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Labrador was right. When their names were called on the House floor the next day, some involved in the plot got cold feet and did not vote, voted present or cast their ballot for Boehner. In the end, only 12 Republicans refused to support Boehner.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Two years later, Boehner suffered 25 GOP defections in the speaker vote \u2014 the largest number of defections in 100 years \u2014 but he would easily win the speaker\u2019s gavel with 216 votes due to a number of members missing the vote; Democrats had attended the funeral of former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo and several other lawmakers couldn\u2019t get to Washington due to bad weather.</p> <p class=\"\">In September 2015, Boehner announced his resignation, after a conservative rabble-rouser, Rep. Mark Meadows, filed a \u201cmotion to vacate the chair\u201d that would have forced yet another floor vote on the unpopular speaker.</p> <p class=\"\">Typically, when a party retakes the majority, the minority leader will have a clear path to the speakership. But in 2018, after 16 years in power, Nancy Pelosi faced a rump rebellion from a new generation of Democrats who wanted her to step aside.</p> <p class=\"\">The week of Thanksgiving that year, 16 rebels in Pelosi\u2019s Democratic caucus <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/sixteen-democrats-sign-letter-opposing-pelosi-speaker-n938066\" target=\"_blank\">signed a letter</a> announcing their opposition to her as speaker. Other Democrats who did not sign contemplated challenging Pelosi for the job.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cAs we head toward the 116th Congress and reclaim our Democratic majority, we believe more strongly than ever that the time has come for new leadership in our caucus,\u201d wrote the 16 Democrats, including Reps. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, Kathleen Rice, D-N.Y., and Seth Moulton, D-Mass.</p> <p class=\"\">If her foes held the line, they would have enough votes to block her on the House floor. But Pelosi, who calls herself a \u201cmaster\u201d legislator and vote counter, was only getting started.</p> <p class=\"\">The first female speaker of the House began picking off her opponents one by one. Pelosi huddled in her office with one potential challenger, Rep. Marcia Fudge. The Ohio Democrat would later <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/20/fudge-endorses-pelosi-for-speaker-dropping-potential-challenge-1009352\">endorse Pelosi</a> and be named chair of a subcommittee overseeing elections.

{"title": "GOP to conduct post-election audit after disappointing midterms", "content": "<p class=\"\">NEW YORK \u2014 A decade after its last election autopsy, the Republican National Committee is moving forward with a new post-election audit designed to examine the GOP\u2019s underwhelming performance in the <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/midterm-elections-2022\" target=\"_blank\">recent midterms</a> and the party\u2019s broader struggles in the years since former President\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump\" target=\"_blank\">Donald Trump</a>\u00a0took power.</p> <p class=\"\">The report, which will likely take several months to complete, is expected to explore internal concerns about candidate quality, the lack of a clear governing agenda and the party\u2019s unwillingness to embrace early voting, among other issues. There is some disagreement about the exact focus and scope of the upcoming review, but committee members involved in the planning suggest it will not shy away from difficult topics \u2014 including Trump\u2019s intense focus on conspiracy theories.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cWe need to figure out what worked and what didn\u2019t work in the \u201922 cycle to make sure we put ourselves in the best position to win in \u201924. I think there\u2019s a lot to learn from,\u201d said RNC committeeman Henry Barbour, of Mississippi, whom RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel tapped to co-chair the review.</p> <p class=\"\">The decision to entertain such an undertaking represents a rare moment of public introspection from a Republican Party that has defiantly resisted any and all calls to change course during the Trump era. Indeed, for the last six years, the GOP has been almost singularly focused on its devotion to Trump and his priorities, even as electoral losses mounted in 2018 and 2020. The party\u2019s disappointing\u00a0midterm results\u00a0earlier in the month marked a breaking point of sorts for some committee members, who are now more open to change.</p> <p class=\"\">Ten years have passed since the RNC last commissioned a post-election audit. The \u201cGrowth and Opportunity Project\u201d of 2013 ultimately called on Republicans to adopt a more inclusive and welcoming tone, while embracing a more forgiving position on immigration.</p> <p class=\"\">Trump embodied everything the report advocated against when he emerged in 2015. Yet his surprising White House victory convinced party leaders to ignore their own recommendations \u2014 at least for a time.</p> <p class=\"\">McDaniel is initiating the post-2022 review as she faces a serious reelection test of her own within the committee, which she has led since Trump took office in 2016. In a corresponding move designed to demonstrate her political strength, McDaniel on Tuesday also announced the creation of an informal advisory council made up of a collection of 2022 candidates \u2014 some successful and some not \u2014 and prominent Republican operatives, including former Trump counselor <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/kellyanne-conway-appears-jan-6-committee-rcna58963\" target=\"_blank\">Kellyanne Conway</a>.</p> <p class=\"\">The advisory council is not expected to have any bearing on the review, which follows pressure on McDaniel to acknowledge a problem within her party. Some RNC members were particularly concerned after she offered a rosy assessment of the GOP\u2019s performance during a conference call the day after the midterms.</p> <p class=\"\">Republicans won a narrow House majority, falling far short of expectations, and failed to win the Senate majority. That\u2019s even as Democrats faced historically bad political headwinds.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cI must say that your remarks on the call this afternoon were disappointing and showed incredible unwillingness to face the reality of what happened last evening. I\u2019ve heard from many members today who feel the same and want a real, honest assessment of what happened,\u201d RNC member Bill Palatucci, of New Jersey, wrote in a private email to McDaniel obtained by The Associated Press.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cWe have to face the fact that most of our candidates and the party in general underperformed by any objective measure,\u201d Palatucci continued. \u201cI wish you well but being unwilling to address the reality of the situation does no one any good.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Trump\u2019s allies are expected to play an active role in the upcoming review.</p> <p class=\"\">McDaniel has tapped Harmeet Dhillon, a Trump attorney and committeewoman from California, to serve as the other co-chair. Former Trump campaign manager David Bossie, an RNC member from Maryland, is also likely to be involved.</p> <p class=\"\">Trump loyalists have played an increasingly large role within the RNC, which consists of elected officials from all 50 states and a central staff in Washington. Those openly critical of Trump have largely been forced out in recent years.</p> <p class=\"\">Now, McDaniel is tasked with maintaining unity within her party as a growing number of GOP leaders push back against Trump\u2019s influence.</p> <p class=\"\">Several Republican presidential prospects are openly preparing to challenge Trump\u2019s bid for the 2024 presidential nomination. In recent days, some of them, including former Vice President Mike Pence, have condemned Trump\u2019s recent private meeting with white supremacist and antisemite Nick Fuentes.</p> <p class=\"\">Despite an apparent shift in the party, those working on the new review are acutely aware that their final report cannot alienate Trump or his base, viewed as a critical piece of the Republican coalition.</p> <p class=\"\">It is a delicate balance, especially as Democrats work to avoid such divisions of their own heading into the next presidential election.</p> <p class=\"endmark\">\u201cDemocrats are unified \u2014 on how to divide America,\u201d said Conway, the former Trump counselor. \u201cRepublicans must be unified \u2014 on how best to help a broken nation.\u201d</p>"},
{"title": "Biden cranks up his courtship of top donors ahead of the 2024 presidential election", "content": "<p class=\"\">President Joe Biden\u2019s top political supporters complained of being shut out for most of his first two years in the White House, and many of them groused about the perceived lack of gratitude from a team whose victory they helped bankroll.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">But that\u2019s all changing.</p> <p class=\"\">With Biden and party officials looking toward the 2024 presidential election \u2014 and on the heels of legislative wins and better-than-expected midterm results \u2014 the same White House that cold-shouldered its high rollers is now warming to them.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cIs it any surprise?\u201d Alan Kessler, a longtime Philadelphia-area fundraiser, said. \u201cWe\u2019re over the midterms. Guess what election is next? Quite frankly, I think they\u2019re doing the right thing.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">The White House is cranking up its donor courtship, a strategy that\u2019s most evident in a shower of social invitations for big-dollar supporters: this week\u2019s state dinner for French President Emmanuel Macron, the arrival and lighting of the national Christmas tree, Biden\u2019s Christmas parties and Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 Hanukkah celebration among them. They\u2019re offering more policy briefings to longtime supporters, Zoom calls with top administration officials and White House tours, too.</p> <p class=\"\">The donors have taken notice and already are praising the change from a team they long complained was unavailable to answer questions in darker political moments for Biden, according to interviews with more than 20 people<strong> </strong>who have contributed to Biden, raised money for him or helped secure White House invitations for his supporters.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">An expanded social calendar means \u201cthey are getting down the list a little further,\u201d in terms of who gets face time with the president, said one White House official. And that could pay dividends for Biden if he runs in 2024.</p> <p class=\"\">Donor maintenance is a critical step for the administration should Biden seek re-election and even beyond, when he will likely want to raise hundreds of millions of dollars for a presidential library. </p> <p class=\"\">Despite all of the Biden administration\u2019s victories and the absence of a midterm shellacking, the president\u2019s poll numbers remain underwater, with an NBC poll taken just before the Nov. 8 election <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23272032-220806-nbc-november-poll-v2\" target=\"_blank\">showing him at 44%</a>. </p> <p class=\"\">Perhaps a more ominous sign, however, is that two-thirds of midterm voters <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/video/exit-poll-shows-biden-2024-run-unpopular-152971845874\">surveyed in an NBC exit poll </a>said they did not want Biden to run for re-election.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cAll of a sudden,\u201d said Alan Patricof, a longtime Democratic fundraiser, \u201cthings start changing when we get close to the next election.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">On Thursday, when Macron arrives at the White House for his official state visit, Biden campaign supporters and fundraisers will be among a large crowd invited to watch the ceremony on the White House lawn. It is the first state dinner Biden has hosted since entering office in 2021. It will honor Macron and celebrate the United States\u2019 long-standing ties with France. State dinners have been a hallmark of the U.S. presidency dating back to 1874, but Covid had curbed the administration\u2019s ability to host such events until now.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cFor one of the first times in this administration, the president\u2019s supporters \u2014 some at least \u2014 will be invited,\u201d according to a person familiar with the White House\u2019s view of the matter. \u201cAnd that, in essence, is a return to a degree of normal that you see in any administration.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">People close to the White House concede that Biden\u2019s political operation has left longtime Democratic fundraisers feeling marginalized and unappreciated. They point to the pandemic as the main reason Biden has shunned the outreach that donors see as a reward for past labors and an incentive to reel in more campaign money ahead of the 2024 election.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">The source with knowledge of the White House thinking, granted anonymity to speak freely, noted the pandemic had \u201cproved incredibly challenging as it relates to gathering indoors in these extraordinary spaces. Now that we\u2019re safely testing, we\u2019re able to do it again. I do believe that there has been a much greater number of events where we\u2019re able to bring people together again. That\u2019s always been the vision of the first lady and the president. It\u2019s just a matter of the right timing.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Among those invited to the state dinner on Macron\u2019s behalf Thursday night is Christopher Korge, chairman of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s finance committee, people familiar with the planning said.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThis is the hottest ticket in town; everyone wants to go,\u201d the person familiar with the White House\u2019s view of its donor outreach said.</p> <p class=\"\">In the past, White Houses have rewarded donors with big-ticket perks, some of which have engendered controversies, like overnight stays in the Lincoln Bedroom during Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Yet some donors also make the point that Biden has never been as attentive to the buck-raking class as Clinton, the gold standard of the modern presidency.</p> <p class=\"\">Biden is \u201cless concerned, less interested, less involved,\u201d than Clinton or former President Barack Obama, Patricof said. \u201cI\u2019ve not been to the White House since he\u2019s been elected. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m sitting here waiting. But there seems to be much less interaction with the donor community than I\u2019ve seen in the past.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">This year, Biden donors are enthralled with something far more simple: The White House throwing open its doors for the holiday season with parties and tours scheduled throughout December. And some who talked to NBC News recognized their worth isn't what it once was, noting that Biden managed to haul in big bucks online from small donors.</p> <p class=\"\">\"The $500,000 people like me, we\u2019re not going to be players in 2024,\" said Dick Harpootlian, a longtime Democratic donor and South Carolina state senator.</p> <p class=\"\">For the White House, the shift is an acceleration of a courtship campaign that began more modestly before the midterm elections. As Biden racked up a handful of major legislative victories this year \u2014 including laws aimed at combating climate change and China\u2019s edge in semiconductor manufacturing \u2014 the White House invited a broad array of supporters to celebrate at bill-signing ceremonies. Invites also went out to a White House Elton John concert.</p> <p class=\"\">Biden\u2019s defenders have long said the White House was closed to many of the president\u2019s allies because he took office during a period of much greater sensitivity to the Covid-19 pandemic. Amid concerns about the omicron variant last year, the White House was forced to abandon plans for a more full set of holiday parties. But there\u2019s no such limitation this year.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThey are inviting just an obscene number of people\u201d to December events, one Democratic official said.</p> <p class=\"\">The new level of TLC is a sign of a Biden team that\u2019s gearing up for a potential re-elect campaign and<strong> </strong>comes after top fundraisers urged Biden\u2019s aides to shift tactics. </p> <p class=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m encouraging them to court more large donors,\u201d one of them said over the summer. Part of their argument has been that the president will need donors in 2024 far more than was needed in 2020 during a pandemic and when Democrats were eagerly opening their wallets to oust Donald Trump from the Oval Office.</p> <p class=\"\">Biden\u2019s engagement with donors is important for another reason, top fundraisers have told his aides: Donors question whether he\u2019s capable of running again, leaving them hesitant to continue cutting checks. One major Democratic fundraiser said donors regularly ask of the president, \u201cIs he really with it?\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Donors who talked to NBC News said they\u2019ve noticed a change with how they\u2019re treated, including making a more conscious effort to set up phone calls with supporters, more regular briefings and even photo lines during visits like Obama made in pivotal states during the midterms. The amped-up effort involves both the White House and a Democratic National Committee that functions as the political arm of Biden\u2019s operation.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThe DNC\u2019s been virtually dormant for two years,\u201d one member of the committee said. \u201cThey\u2019re ramping up their game.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Different donors have had different expectations. Tim Lim, a Democratic strategist and Biden bundler, was among those who grew frustrated over the White House's attention to donors, bringing his complaint to the Democratic National Committee.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s childish, frankly. I even admit that now,\u201d Lim said. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to do it. But when you\u2019re trying to get an Easter Egg Roll ticket for your family, you kind of get desperate.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">The White House\u2019s shift in paying closer attention to supporters was an obvious one, he said, citing invites to a garden tour, the unveiling of Obama\u2019s White House portrait, White House trick-or-treating as well as holiday parties.</p> <p class=\"\">Another donor, who in the past complained of not having enough access, cited a recent Zoom call with White House senior adviser Steve Ricchetti and deputy chief of staff Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon that was directed at some of Biden\u2019s earliest supporters. Some of those same people were invited to the White House next month for an in-person policy briefing.</p> <p class=\"\">Some donors, however, think the White House took too long to step up its game.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cGetting up to speed has taken longer than it should,\u201d said Susie Tompkins Buell, a longtime high-dollar Democratic donor. She said supporters recognized the administration was consumed by \u201cexcessive workloads and traumas\u201d early on.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cI think donors understand but communication absolutely needs more effective attention,\u201d Buell added. She said she\u2019s seeing more examples of the White House recognizing it needs to appreciate donors but that it \u201cseems like it was not a natural instinct.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">A running question throughout this administration has been whether Biden, who turned 80 years old last week, will mount one more campaign or step aside. </p> <p class=\"\">Kessler said he spoke to Biden in late October at a Pennsylvania Democratic Party event and thanked him for having recently affirmed <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/joe-biden/biden-warns-republicans-will-tear-accomplishments-win-midterms-rcna53409\">it\u2019s his intention to run again</a>.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cI know you get tired of hearing, \u2018Is he really running?\u2019\u201d Kessler recalled telling the president. \u201cBut when you come out with strong statements like that, it\u2019s very helpful to people like me who are asked all the time.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">And how did Biden respond?</p> <p class=\"endmark\">\u201cHe liked it,\u201d Kessler said.</p>"},
{"title": "Biden leans into manufacturing in campaign-style Michigan speech", "content": "<p class=\"\">BAY CITY, Mich. \u2014 An exultant <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house\" target=\"_blank\">Joe Biden</a> sounded every bit like a president hungering for another term, imploring Americans in a speech Tuesday to buy into his vision of a nation making dramatic <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy\" target=\"_blank\">economic strides</a> against global competition.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cWe\u2019re building a better America,\u201d Biden said at a plant that makes components for electric vehicles. \u201cWe just have to keep it going! I know we can.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Biden vowed in his half-hour remarks that the U.S. would expand its manufacturing capacity to levels preventing the sorts of supply-side disruptions that led to shortages of vital products early on during the <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/health/coronavirus\" target=\"_blank\">Covid pandemic</a>. He suggested that China and Europe aren\u2019t necessarily happy about America\u2019s economic ambitions, but he indicated he\u2019s determined to supplant their role as vital links in the worldwide supply chain.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cWe\u2019ve proven it\u2019s never, ever been a good bet to bet against America,\u201d Biden said at SK Siltron CSS\u2019 gleaming new plant before an appreciative crowd of union workers, elected officials and political supporters. \u201cI mean it.\u201d\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Biden was speaking about the nation, but he might just as well have been talking about himself. Two years ago, anyone betting against Biden\u2019s political prospects would have lost. He upended conventional thinking when he rallied after early defeats in the 2020 Democratic primaries and then went on to win the nomination and oust President Donald Trump. Just this month, Biden\u2019s party defied history in the midterm elections by keeping control of the Senate and staving off heavy losses in the House.</p> <p class=\"\">Still, Biden has been guarded about his own political future, saying he intends to run for re-election in 2024 while stopping short of a definitive announcement.</p> <p class=\"\">Rep. Dan Kildee, a Democrat who represents the district that\u2019s home to the SK Siltron CSS plant and preceded Biden onstage, said in an interview Tuesday that he doesn\u2019t know Biden\u2019s plans for the next election. Asked whether he wants Biden to run, Kildee said: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be up to him.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cIf he decides to run, obviously we\u2019ll support him,\u201d he added. \u201cThese are personal decisions before they\u2019re political ones.\u201d\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Biden was introduced by Kildee and another Democrat who figured prominently in the party\u2019s midterm success story: Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. Both Whitmer and Kildee defeated Republican challengers.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">In the interview, Kildee said Biden\u2019s focus on creating jobs is a winning message that Democrats should carry into 2024.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cI ran on the agenda that President Biden and I and others promoted \u2014 and I won in a Republican-leaning district by more than 10 points,\u201d said Kildee, whose congressional race was one of the most competitive in the country. \u201cSo I think that Michigan is well-positioned to show the rest of the country that when you lean in, have great candidates and policies that make sense, we will be rewarded for it.\u201d\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">As a backdrop for the speech, Biden chose a plant that symbolizes the kind of high-tech manufacturing jobs he wants to create. Earlier this year, SK Siltron CSS opened a facility here \u2014 about 100 miles northwest of Detroit \u2014 as part of a $300 million expansion project. The plant employs about 220 people, and the company expects the number to grow to 300 in the coming years, a spokesman said.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Biden touts his industrial policy as a reason for his optimism about U.S. economic prospects. In August, he signed into law the CHIPS and Science measure, which sets aside more than $52 billion for semiconductor manufacturing and research. As a condition, recipients of the money are barred from building \u201c<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/08/09/fact-sheet-chips-and-science-act-will-lower-costs-create-jobs-strengthen-supply-chains-and-counter-china/\">certain facilities in China and other countries of concern</a>,\u201d the White House said.</p> <p class=\"\">But the credit Biden has given himself may be overstated. U.S. employment in the manufacturing sector has been<a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MANEMP\"> declining since the late 1970s</a>, in part because of the outsourcing of jobs to countries that pay much lower wages.</p> <p class=\"\">Biden has said <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/11/04/statement-by-president-joe-biden-on-the-october-jobs-report/\">more than 700,000 manufacturing jobs</a> have been added since he took office. A <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/article/2022/nov/01/joe-biden-and-manufacturing-jobs-closer-look/\">PolitiFact report</a>, however, says that the uptick was evident under Biden\u2019s predecessor and that, in part, it was a product of Trump administration policies.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Biden\u2019s visit Tuesday dovetailed neatly with the Democrats\u2019 political ambitions. The plant is in Bay County, which Trump won in both 2016 and 2020. Before the 2016 election, the last Republican presidential candidate to win the county was Ronald Reagan, in his landslide re-election in 1984.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Democrats would like to flip the county in 2024, when Michigan will, as ever, loom as a crucial battleground state. A step toward\u00a0making that happen is to show voters that government policies are helping create jobs, local party officials said.</p> <p class=\"endmark\">\u201cBay County was traditionally a very dependable Democratic county, and that changed when Trump came into being,\u201d said Karen Tighe, the county Democratic chairwoman. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping that President Biden\u2019s visit might entice people to come back to the fold and recognize what his administration is doing for us economically.\u201d</p>"},
{"title": "Biden rallies lawmakers to act to avert rail strike ahead of looming deadline", "content": "<p class=\"\">WASHINGTON \u2014 President Joe Biden stepped up calls for Congress to avert a looming rail strike in a meeting at the White House with top lawmakers Tuesday, warning that the economy was at risk if they failed to act in the next few days. </p> <p class=\"\">Talks between railway workers and their employers appear to have stalled, making the prospect of a Dec. 9 strike more imminent.\u00a0Shipments of crucial materials, like chemicals used to treat drinking water, are set to start winding down this week, industry leaders have warned, after some railway unions <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/freight-rail-union-vote-strike-rcna57942\" target=\"_blank\">rejected</a> an agreement between labor leaders and railway companies.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cCongress, I think, has to act appropriately. It\u2019s not an easy call, but I think we have to do it,\" Biden said before the meeting. \"The economy is at risk.\"</p> <p class=\"\">Congress has the authority to block a strike and impose a labor agreement on the workers under a <a href=\"https://railroads.dot.gov/sites/fra.dot.gov/files/fra_net/1647/Railway%20Labor%20Act%20Overview.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">1926 law </a>intended to prevent the interruption of interstate commerce in labor disputes. But doing so would require bridging fundamental divides over Democrats\u2019 long-held support for unions and Republicans\u2019 support for businesses in less than 10 days. </p> <p class=\"\">After the meeting with Biden, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said he would work with Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky to get a deal done as possible. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the House would vote on a bill Wednesday.</p> <p class=\"\">\"The leader and I are going to have to get together and try to get that done, and we are working on it,\" Schumer told reporters when he was asked whether he had enough votes to pass legislation.</p> <p class=\"\">McConnell echoed Schumer, saying Congress needed to pass a bill. </p> <p class=\"\">Biden got <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/biden-urges-congress-pass-legislation-avert-nationwide-rail-strike-rcna59081\" target=\"_blank\">directly involved</a> Monday, saying Congress should immediately pass legislation to adopt a tentative agreement reached between labor leaders and railway operators in September \u2014\u00a0but rejected by four of the 12 unions \u2014 to avert a \u201cpotentially crippling national rail shutdown\u201d that would \u201cdevastate\u201d the economy.</p> <p class=\"\">It was a shift in messaging for the White House, which for weeks has said the best solution would be for the workers and employers to reach a resolution on their own by adopting the September deal, which the administration helped broker.</p> <p class=\"\">Companies across a variety of industries, including retailers, farmers, oil producers and chemical makers, have increasingly raised alarms in recent weeks about the massive disruption a strike would cause across the economy. </p> <p class=\"\">But so far, there has been little momentum in Congress to pass any legislation to avert a strike as lawmakers return from the Thanksgiving recess with an already packed schedule.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Congress can take several steps to prevent a rail strike, which it has done 18 times since the 1960s. It could extend the so-called cooling-off period, giving the parties more time to try to reach a voluntary agreement before workers can strike. It could also impose a labor agreement on the workers similar to the one already agreed to by labor leaders and carriers or make modifications to the agreement that could be more or less favorable to workers or their employers.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Pelosi said the House would vote this week on the legislation Biden is calling for, which wouldn\u2019t make any changes to the current agreement.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThis week, the House will take up a bill adopting the Tentative Agreement \u2014 with no poison pills or changes to the negotiated terms \u2014 and send it to the Senate,\u201d she said in a statement following Biden\u2019s.</p> <p class=\"\">House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., left the White House meeting critical of the need to pass legislation but saying he thought it would pass. </p> <p class=\"\">\u201cI think it will pass, but it\u2019s unfortunate this is how we\u2019re running our economy today,\" McCarthy said. </p> <p class=\"\">The bigger obstacle may lie with the Senate, where Democrats and Republicans will need to come together to get the 60 votes needed to avoid a filibuster.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">For Democrats, imposing a contract on workers would seem to fly in the face of the pro-union positions many have spent their careers advocating for and risk upsetting their key constituency of union members and labor leaders.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">But it could also provide an opportunity for Democrats to step in and give additional benefits to the rail workers, like paid sick days, although that would likely make it more difficult to get Republican support. </p> <p class=\"\">Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., blocked legislation in September that would have averted a potential strike at the time before a tentative agreement was reached, arguing that rail workers needed better sick leave.</p> <p class=\"\">As for Republicans, the prospect of a strike gives them an opportunity to blast Biden for his handling of the economy and fan the flames of a potential economic disruption that could hurt Democrats in the next election. It could also give them an opening to weaken the contract brokered with labor leaders, making it more favorable to the industry.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the top Republican on the Commerce Committee, sounded an optimistic tone. </p> <p class=\"\">\"The president says he is going to ask Congress to act, and I would expect Congress to support that request,\u201d he said.  </p> <p class=\"\">The companies have warned that a shutdown of the railways would quickly result in cities\u2019 running out of clean drinking water, shortages of fuel and farmers\u2019 being unable to get feed for their livestock. It would also cause manufacturing across a variety of sectors to grind to a halt and result in backlogs at the ports with trains unable to transport cargo off ships.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cIf you look at the national harm that would come around even by the build-up of a strike, it is simply untenable, and we are well past time for having Congress step in and resolve this,\u201d said John Drake, the vice president of transportation, infrastructure and supply chain policy for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. </p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThey aren\u2019t going to have a choice,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not something where we have time to dither around with it. Congressional leadership is going to have to step in and take action, and we are going to need bipartisan support, and frankly, we have run out of time for political games. We need a solution now.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">More than 400 industry groups signed on to a <a href=\"https://www.uschamber.com/infrastructure/transportation/coalition-letter-on-rail-labor-negotiations\" target=\"_blank\">letter</a> Monday imploring congressional leaders to act and warning that a strike would result in \u201ccertain economic destruction.\u201d The White House estimates as many as 765,000 people in the U.S. could be put out of work in the first two weeks of a strike.</p> <p class=\"endmark\">\"The only thing standing in the way of ensuring that the American economy doesn't take a major hit as a consequence of a catastrophic rail strike is the United States Congress,\" Mike Sommers, the head of the American Petroleum Institute, said in a call with reporters. \"We need to make sure that the United States Congress acts on this as quickly as possible to take away any threat of that economic calamity from occurring.\"</p>"},

The State Department said it had not coordinated in any way with the soccer federation, and the U.S. team said it was not informed of the symbolic gesture beforehand.</p> <p class=\"\">Beyond the political firestorm, the game itself comes with high stakes, as the young U.S. team needs a win to advance to the next stage of the tournament. But at a news conference on the eve of the match, coach Gregg Berhalter and team captain Tyler Adams faced one political question after another from Iranian journalists.</p> <p class=\"\">Asked about his views on U.S. restrictions on visas for Iranian citizens, Berhalter said:\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know enough about politics.

He added: \u201cI think as long as you see progress, that\u2019s the most important thing.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">When Iran\u2019s coach, Carlos Queiroz, spoke to reporters, he also tried to steer the discussion away from politics.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cI understand your questions and the stories that you, as professionals, you need to bring,\u201d Queiroz said. But he added: \u201cLet\u2019s enjoy that party.

{"title": "House Democrats prepare to pass the torch, avoiding messy leadership fights", "content": "<p class=\"\">Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s departure from leadership could easily have led to a power vacuum in which a host of ambitious lawmakers \u2014 old and young \u2014 publicly battled it out for the chance to lead House Democrats.</p> <p class=\"\">Instead, a new generation \u2014 Reps. Hakeem Jeffries, 52, of New York; Katherine Clark, 59, of Massachusetts; and Pete Aguilar, 43, of California \u2014 will almost certainly be elected to the top three leadership slots this week without a challenge or much fanfare.</p> <p class=\"\">There were a couple of bumps along the way. <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/pelosis-departure-ushers-long-awaited-generational-change-democrats-rcna57797\" target=\"_blank\">Some younger members are bitter</a> that 82-year-old Majority Whip Jim Clyburn of South Carolina has opted to remain in leadership rather than follow Pelosi, also 82, and Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, 83, into the sunset.</p> <p class=\"\">But, by and large, Pelosi and her almost-certain successor, Jeffries, have been able to orchestrate a smooth passing of the torch from one generation to the next.</p> <p class=\"\">Shortly before Pelosi\u2019s announcement Thursday that she was stepping down, Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff signaled he would not run for House leadership and would focus his efforts on a future Senate bid instead. That avoided a knock-down, drag-out fight between Schiff, a top Pelosi ally, fellow Californian and prolific fundraiser, and Jeffries, who is poised to become the first Black leader of a congressional caucus.</p> <p class=\"\">Hoyer, of Maryland, who has served in leadership since George H.W. Bush was president, also said he would not seek the top job and instead plans to return to the powerful Appropriations Committee.</p> <p class=\"\">And rather than taking on Clark for the No. 2 leadership post, Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal of Washington <a href=\"https://www.oregonlive.com/nation/2022/11/washingtons-pramila-jayapal-wont-seek-dem-leadership-in-congress.html\" target=\"_blank\">decided to run for another term</a> leading her caucus of roughly 100 House liberals.</p> <p class=\"\">However, Clyburn\u2019s decision to remain in leadership represented a setback for those calling for \u201cnew blood\u201d and hoping for a clean break from the triumvirate of Pelosi, Hoyer and Clyburn that had ruled the Democrats for the past two decades.</p> <p class=\"\">Clyburn announced he would run for his old post in the minority, known as \u201cassistant leader,\u201d which deprived younger members from occupying that role. It had been considered the No. 3 job.</p> <p class=\"\">Aguilar originally had his eyes set on the assistant leader position, but Clyburn\u2019s move forced him to run for caucus chair. Under a new arrangement, assistant leader will shift to No. 4 and Democratic Caucus chair will move up to No. 3.</p> <p class=\"\">That left Rep. Joe Neguse, 38, who had been campaigning behind the scenes for months for caucus chair, as the odd man out.</p> <p class=\"\">Some Neguse allies urged him to stay in the race and take on Aguilar, frustrated by the domino effect created by Clyburn\u2019s decision. But Pelosi quickly endorsed the slate of young leaders \u2014 Jeffries, Clark and Aguilar \u2014 and others followed suit, heading off any possibility of a rebellion from the rank and file and a messy leadership fight between Aguilar and Neguse.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThere are a lot of upset folks. The feeling is that Speaker Pelosi and Leader Hoyer had the grace to step aside, and people cannot believe that Clyburn is unwilling to do it. There is really resentment there about the down-ballot impact,\u201d one younger House Democrat told NBC News.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThere\u2019s incredulity at the idea that this is simply about holding onto power \u2014 not that there\u2019s a particular goal in sight. It\u2019s hard to feel like we are turning the page.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">A Clyburn spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. Clyburn has called Jeffries, Clark and Aguilar \u201cour new generation of Democratic Leaders\u201d but has not weighed in on the Neguse situation.</p> <p class=\"\">Last week, a potential escape hatch emerged. Neguse informed colleagues on Nov. 21 he was officially dropping his bid for caucus chair and would run to be chair of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee (DPCC), the House Democrats\u2019 messaging arm, if the DPCC operation could be restructured.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Soon after, Jeffries, Clark and Aguilar informed their members in a joint letter that a rule change would be offered this week to do precisely that: overhaul the DPCC to have one elected chairman, likely Neguse, and three elected co-chairs underneath.</p> <p class=\"\">Some members have referred to that post as the \u201cchair of chairs\" and it's a structure that has existed before.</p> <p class=\"\">Neguse almost certainly would be the favorite to win that race. The son of Eritrean immigrants and the first Black congressman elected from Colorado, Neguse saw his national profile rise after serving as a Democratic prosecutor during former President Donald Trump\u2019s second impeachment trial.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">For the past two years, he has served as one of four co-chairs of the DPCC, alongside Reps. Matt Cartwright of Pennsylvania, Debbie Dingell of Michigan and Ted Lieu of California; Dingell and Lieu are now among at least four candidates running for vice chair of the Democratic Caucus.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cOver the past two years, I worked alongside my fellow DPCC Co-Chairs to engage each member of our diverse caucus to develop our message framing,\u201d Neguse said in a letter to colleagues Monday. </p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThat message of putting People Over Politics became an essential tool for our members as we defended our democracy and defied historic norms by limiting Republican gains in this year\u2019s election.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">In addition to Dingell and Lieu, Reps. Madeleine Dean of Pennsylvania and Congressional Black Caucus Chair Joyce Beatty of Ohio are running for vice chair of the caucus. It's the No. 5 slot, seen as a steppingstone to other top leadership roles.</p> <p class=\"endmark\">The race to lead the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the House Democrats' campaign arm, for the 2024 cycle will feature a matchup between two Californians, Reps. Tony Cardenas and Ami Bera.</p>"},

The dinner was quick and uneventful,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey then left for the airport.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">On Saturday, Deputy White House Press Secretary Andrew Bates denounced the meeting.\u00a0\u201cBigotry, hate, and antisemitism have absolutely no place in America \u2014 including at Mar-A-Lago,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHolocaust denial is repugnant and dangerous, and it must be forcefully condemned.\u201d </p> <p class=\"\">The president, asked by reporters for his reaction, responded, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to hear what I think.\u201d\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">A person familiar with the dinner conversation who is not involved in Trump's presidential campaign and two Trump advisers briefed on the dinner corroborated Trump's claim that he didn't know Fuentes' identity when they dined together. The three sources spoke on condition on anonymity given the nature of the controversy.</p> <p class=\"\">But despite Trump suggesting that the event was \u201cuneventful,\u201d the fallout over his dinner with Fuentes appears to have thrown Trump\u2019s campaign into damage control mode. The former president took hours to respond publicly after multiple media outlets reported that Fuentes was present at the dinner. </p> <p class=\"\">Even the two Trump advisers winced at how a <a href=\"https://www.adl.org/blog/nicholas-j-fuentes-five-things-to-know\">Holocaust denier</a> like Fuentes was able to wind up with Trump at dinner \u2014 even if it was by mistake \u2014 along with the rapper, who had just had his <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/kanye-west-returns-twitter-ban-anti-semitic-remarks-rcna58116\">Twitter account restored</a> but lost major endorsement deals for making antisemitic remarks.</p> <p class=\"\">\"This is a f---ing nightmare,\" said one longtime Trump adviser who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of stoking the former president's ire at \"disloyal\" people who criticize him. \"If people are looking at [Florida Gov. Ron] DeSantis to run against Trump, here's another reason why.\"</p> <p class=\"\">All three sources familiar with the dinner told NBC News there was one glaring inaccuracy in Trump\u2019s statement: Trump knew one of the three \u201cfriends\u201d brought by the rapper, Karen Giorno. She was the Trump campaign's Florida director in 2016 and the former president knows her by name and sight, the sources said. In addition to Giorno and Fuentes, Ye also brought along another man who was an associate, according to the sources.</p> <p class=\"\">The source familiar with the dinner conversation said the dinner grew heated after Ye \u2014 who announced another run for president in 2024 on Thursday \u2014 asked Trump to be his running mate. Trump then began insulting Ye\u2019s ex-wife, Kim Kardashian, according to the source and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/1595965974293118979\" target=\"_blank\">a video</a> that Ye posted to Twitter on Thanksgiving Day recounting the dinner.</p> <p class=\"\">The source also said Fuentes is helping to advise Ye in his second presidential campaign. The rapper has said the campaign would be managed by Milo Yiannopoulos, a far-right provocateur and former Breitbart editor who was banned from Twitter in 2016 for inciting a racist campaign against comedian Leslie Jones.</p> <p class=\"\">Ye, Fuentes and Yiannopoulos declined to comment on the dinner.</p> <p class=\"\">Details about the dinner began to emerge on Twitter Wednesday when a Politico reporter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/meridithmcgraw/status/1595526564271251473\" target=\"_blank\">tweeted</a> that Ye and Fuentes had been spotted at Mar-a-Lago. The conservative website <a href=\"https://timcast.com/news/exclusive-details-ye-brings-nick-fuentes-and-karen-giorno-to-dinner-with-trump/\" target=\"_blank\">Timcast </a>confirmed Fuentes's presence at the dinner, followed by <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2022/11/25/trump-nick-fuentes-ye-kanye\" target=\"_blank\">Axios. </a></p> <p class=\"\">The porous nature of Mar-a-Lago, where anyone with connections can run into Trump, has long been a concern of his advisers. It\u2019s also helped land Trump in the sights of a federal investigation after the FBI in August executed a search warrant at the club in search of documents marked classified that the federal government says Trump should not have possessed.</p> <p class=\"\">Trump\u2019s statement on Truth Social did not disavow antisemitism or racism, but his campaign in a follow-up message pointed to Trump\u2019s support of Israel, the Abraham Accords Middle East peace deal his administration reached and his opposition to antisemitism in Iran.</p> <p class=\"\">But Trump has also <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/10/17/trump-history-antisemitic-tropes/\" target=\"_blank\">embraced</a> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/10/17/trump-history-antisemitic-tropes/\" target=\"_blank\">antisemitic tropes</a> and figures, implying that American Jews have dual loyalty to Israel and saying that there were \"<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/05/08/very-fine-people-charlottesville-who-were-they-2/\" target=\"_blank\">very fine people on both sides</a>\" at the white supremacist \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia,  in 2017. Fuentes attended that event, and after Trump said he denounced white supremacy at the rally, Fuentes\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/bennyjohnson/status/1196606218036494336\" target=\"_blank\">denounced</a>\u00a0him for that.</p> <p class=\"\">In his video debrief, Ye said that \u201cTrump is really impressed with Nick Fuentes. Nick Fuentes \u2014 unlike so many of the lawyers and so many people that he was left with on his 2020 campaign \u2014 he\u2019s actually a loyalist [for Trump].\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">The source independent of Trump\u2019s campaign said Trump had planned to dine privately with Ye at Mar-a-Lago\u2019s library, but he then said they should eat outside on the public patio. The former president also invited the others along.</p> <p class=\"\">The subject of racism and antisemitism didn\u2019t come up, and Fuentes \u201cpresented as statistician. He was very knowledgeable of polls and Trump\u2019s campaign. Trump was very impressed but Trump didn\u2019t know who he was,\u201d the source said.</p> <p class=\"\">Trump asked Fuentes about his 2024 announcement speech the week before and Fuentes criticized Trump for being too \"teleprompter\" scripted and having low energy,<strong> </strong>the source said. Fuentes and West, the source added, also said Trump should have issued a blanket pardon for everyone involved in the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021, which Ye\u2019s video debrief also mentioned.</p> <p class=\"\">Trump also mentioned his adviser, Jason Miller, to Fuentes, who criticized the veteran operative for now running the social media site Gettr, which has banned Fuentes, according to a copy of a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/1595995970969382913\">group text message exchange</a> that Ye posted to Twitter Thursday.</p> <p class=\"\">Trump\u2019s Truth Social platform, however, has <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2022/02/27/truth-social-verifies-white-nationalist-fuentes-trump\">verified Fuentes</a> as a notable user.</p> <p class=\"\">At a certain point, the conversation turned tense and Trump began making his critical remarks about Ye\u2019s ex, Kardashian. \u201cThat\u2019s the mother of my children,\u201d Ye protested, according to his video debrief.</p> <p class=\"\">Trump then grew animated about Ye challenging him. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to win. You can\u2019t beat me,\u201d Trump told Ye, the source said. \u201cNick, you work for the guy, and just because you work for him, you\u2019re going to tell him he can beat me? You just got finished telling me I was the best president ever.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Ye said in his video debrief that Trump was angry.</p> <p class=\"endmark\">\u201cWhen Trump started basically screaming at me at the table telling me I was going to lose, I mean, has that ever worked for anyone in history?\u201d the rapper said. \u201cI\u2019m like hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, Trump. You\u2019re talkin\u2019 to Ye.\u201d</p>"},

{"title": "In win for Democrats, Georgia judge allows early voting in Senate runoff on Saturday after Thanksgiving", "content": "<p class=\"\">A Fulton County judge ruled Friday that the Georgia Secretary of State cannot prohibit counties from voting on the Saturday after Thanksgiving, a victory for the state Democratic Party and Sen.

Brian Kemp in March 2021, which stipulates early in-person voting must end the Friday before the runoff. This year, that would be Friday, Dec. 2. </p> <p class=\"\">The law also stipulates early in-person voting not be held on any Saturday that follows a \u201cpublic or legal holiday\u201d on the preceding Thursday or Friday. Raffensperger contended that meant there would be no early in-person voting on Nov. 26, the Saturday following Thanksgiving.

{"title": "Republicans pitched an economic solution. Now they'll have to deliver. ", "content": "<p class=\"\">WASHINGTON \u2014 Central to the Republicans' pitch to voters in the midterm elections was a pledge to <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/midterm-election-inflation-economy-what-it-means-rcna56473\" target=\"_blank\">tackle high inflation </a>and bolster the economy, but a GOP \"civil war\" is brewing over what policies could accomplish those goals. </p> <p class=\"\">Having now secured some power \u2014 Republicans will control the House, NBC News projected on Wednesday \u2014 the party will have an ownership stake in the economy. </p> <p class=\"\">In a sign of how much Republicans are going to rely on the economy, former President Donald Trump, in launching his re-election campaign last Tuesday, opted to skip his usual diatribes about the 2020 election and instead tried to make the economy central to his argument about why he should be returned to power. </p> <p class=\"\">Midterm voters cited <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/us-inflation-rate-october-2022-economy-stands-now-rcna56272\">inflation</a> as their <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/inflation-abortion-lead-list-voter-concerns-nbc-news-exit-poll-finds-rcna56258\" target=\"_blank\">top concern, </a>with 1 in 5 saying it had caused them severe economic hardship, according to NBC News exit polls. They gave Republicans higher marks than Democrats on handling the economy.</p> <p class=\"\">While Republicans sought to seize on that economic anxiety during the campaign, most candidates provided few specifics. And Republicans appear to be divided within the party, with some calling for cutting taxes and reducing government spending and others embracing a more populist approach of protectionist trade policies and limiting immigration.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThe GOP still doesn\u2019t know what its economic policy is in a post-Trump world,\u201d said Brian Riedl, who worked for six years as chief economist for Republican Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio and is now a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. \u201cTen years ago it would have been spending cuts, regulatory reform, free trade and free market policies, and in a post-Trump world, all of those policies are kind of on the outs. So there\u2019s actually a bit of a civil war going on in the GOP around economics.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Republicans will be limited in what they can achieve with control of the House because Democrats control the Senate and President Joe Biden will have veto power over legislation passed. Biden said he has no plans to change his approach to the economy, despite voters\u2019 sentiments, making a shift toward a compromise with Republicans on economic policy seemingly unlikely.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">That may mean that one of the Republicans greatest economic tools will be their ability to block further spending by Democrats in such areas as Covid response or on programs to help lower-income households, including the child tax credit and affordable housing initiatives. Republicans have argued that that type of government spending has contributed to inflation.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cLarge partisan initiatives are off the table, no one can do reconciliation, there\u2019s no path to something large where there\u2019s disagreement,\u201d said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum and a former economic adviser to George W. Bush and John McCain. \u201cThat means there will be a lot less economic policy. There will be no America Rescue Plan, no Inflation Reduction Act, things like that, and I think that would benefit the economy.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">If there is a recession, as a number of CEOs and economists have projected, Republican control of the House would likely mean that any stimulus or relief package to help struggling households and small businesses would be significantly smaller than it would be with Democrats in control given Republicans\u2019 vocal opposition to additional spending. </p> <p class=\"\">Republicans also risk facing the same type of economic blame they levied against Democrats when they face voters again in 2024.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cRepublicans are going to need to deliver on the economy, especially if the economy is worsening and inflation is worsening,\u201d said Riedl. \u201cThe Republicans will be pressured to deliver or at least put out an agenda to contrast themselves with President Biden.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Republicans have said they would block additional taxes on corporations, such as a windfall profit tax Biden has suggested placing on oil and gas companies. But passing large tax cuts or making the Trump-era tax cuts permanent, something Republicans promised to do during the campaign, would be much more difficult because of opposition from many Democrats.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">One thing Republicans will have the power to do with control of the House is launch investigations and hearings into the Biden administration\u2019s handling of the economy. Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas, the top Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee, said Republicans plan to investigate possible misuse of taxpayer dollars as part of Covid relief efforts, IRS policies and Biden\u2019s expansion of health coverage.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cOur focus is going to be on pulling the curtain back, giving the public really the right to know how their tax dollars are spent and how their government works,\u201d Brady said in an interview on Fox Business Thursday.</p> <p class=\"\">Divided control of Congress will increase the chance of another standoff over the debt ceiling that could cause the government to shut down or the U.S. to default on its debts for the first time.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cI think voters should expect some unfortunate drama around raising the debt ceiling, and Republicans may try to extract some spending cuts in exchange for raising the debt ceiling,\u201d said Michael Strain, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute.</p> <p class=\"\">Inflation showed some signs of moderating earlier this week with consumer price increases easing to 7.7% in October from a year earlier and decreasing from 8.2% in September.</p> <p class=\"\">Gas prices have been a particular concern, with 65% saying the high prices have been a financial hardship for them, according to the NBC exit poll. Energy analysts and investors have said there is little that can be done from a policy standpoint to lower prices, which have been driven higher by a range of factors, including surging demand following the pandemic, Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and limited refinery capacity.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Ultimately, the main factor influencing inflation would be the Federal Reserve, given its ability to raise interest rates; economic policy analysts said there's not much Congress can do even with single party control, at least not in the near term.\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p class=\"endmark\">\u201cThere is very little that Congress can do,\u201d said Holtz-Eakin. \u201cThey operate on years, and that\u2019s not the right timetable for inflation fighting. You have to be much more nimble. The tools they have are quite clunky. So they just need to be out of that game. That\u2019s the Federal Reserve\u2019s job now.\u201d</p>"},

Brian Kemp in March 2021, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/georgia-passes-vast-restrictive-voting-law-limiting-early-voting-ballot-n1262101\" target=\"_blank\">cut in half the time</a> allowed between a general election and a runoff election \u2014 drastically shortening the period during which many voters must request, receive and cast ballots. The law's narrowed time frame also effectively cuts the early in-person voting period, from a minimum of 16 days in 2020 to a minimum of 5 in 2022, while existing rules have ensured almost no new voters will be eligible to vote in the runoff.</p> <p class=\"\">Proponents of the bill's provisions on runoffs argue that cutting the period eases a long and arduous process for everyone involved. The law's authors <a href=\"https://www.legis.ga.gov/api/legislation/document/20212022/201498\" target=\"_blank\">even wrote into the bill </a>that \"the lengthy nine-week runoffs in 2020 were exhausting for candidates, donors, and 120 electors.\" Other supporters, including Gabriel Sterling, the chief operating officer in the Office of the Georgia Secretary of State, note that before 2013, the state's runoff period was four weeks and that the elections ran without problems.</p> <p class=\"\">\"This is not the first time we've had to do this,\" Sterling said at <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?524156-1/georgia-secretary-state-brad-raffensperger-update-senate-runoff-election#\" target=\"_blank\">a news conference</a> last week. \"This is not that unique.\"</p> <p class=\"\">But voting rights advocates, both in Georgia and around the country, say the new law's changes present challenges. </p> <p class=\"\">\u201cIt was not just that the runoff date was moved up, it\u2019s that the period to get so many steps done has been condensed,\u201d said Danielle Lang, the senior director of the voting rights unit at the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan voting watchdog group.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThe big takeaway here is that the compressing of the time line for a runoff has spillover effects on access for voters,\u201d she said.</p> <p class=\"\">Here are several of the ways the new law could affect voters in the runoff.</p> <p class=\"\">Under SB 202, Georgia runoff elections now take place 28 days after the general election \u2014 less than half the original nine-week period that existed before the law. This year\u2019s runoff will take place on Dec. 6, following the Nov. 8 midterms. </p> <p class=\"\">The law, however, does not change an existing rule that voters must register at least 30 days before an election.</p> <p class=\"\">As a result, new voters who weren\u2019t registered for the general election <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/georgia-organizations-push-keep-black-voters-energized-crucial-senate-rcna57160\">will not be able to register </a>in time to vote in the runoff  because the deadline will have already passed.</p> <p class=\"\">That\u2019s a stark difference from the landscape in the state in 2020 \u2014 that year both of the state\u2019s U.S. Senate races advanced to a runoff that would determine control of the chamber \u2014 when candidates and outside groups rushed to register droves of new voters.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThe bottom line is that nobody can vote in this runoff who didn\u2019t register as of Nov. 7,\u201d said Lang. She added there\u2019s likely still a narrow new pool of voters who registered too late to vote in the general election but could make the 30-day deadline for the runoff.</p> <p class=\"\">Domestic, absentee mail-in ballot voters will now have a much shorter window in which to do everything required of them to cast their ballots on time.</p> <p class=\"\">Before SB 202, these voters would have had nine weeks to request an absentee ballot, receive that ballot and mail it in or drop it off. Now they will have to do all that in half the time.</p> <p class=\"\">Under existing runoff procedures, most Georgians who want to cast an absentee mail-in ballot (voters 65 and older and disabled voters will be sent an absentee mail-in ballot automatically if registered to vote) must first request such a ballot, in compliance with the law's new voter ID requirement. The deadline for local election officials to receive those absentee ballot applications is Nov. 25, the day after Thanksgiving. </p> <p class=\"\">If most voters don\u2019t mail their applications well before the Nov. 25 deadline, local election officials could be dealing with a backlog upon returning from the Thanksgiving weekend on Monday Nov. 28 \u2014 the same day early in-person voting will begin in most counties.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">The law mandates that the ballots must be mailed to voters within three days of receipt of the applications \u2014 a tight time frame that advocates warn may not be met, given that the deadline overlaps with a holiday and comes just days before the start of early in-person voting.</p> <p class=\"\">Once voters receive their absentee ballots, they must choose their candidates and mail those ballots back, again in compliance with the voter ID requirement. Absentee mail-in ballots received before 7 p.m. on the day of the election \u2014 Dec. 6 \u2014 will be counted, per Georgia\u2019s law. Voters may also deposit their absentee ballots in drop boxes.</p> <p class=\"\">Voting rights activists, who have worked to bolster awareness of the new rules through voter education initiatives, expressed concern that the deadlines would sneak up on voters, especially with the holiday.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThe shorter time frame may be a challenge to voters who don't realize how quickly some of these deadline are going to come up or who haven't thought through how they are going to vote,\u201d said Andrew Garber, an attorney at the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Under a separate provision of SB 202, overseas and military absentee voters were provided a ranked choice voting ballot as their general election ballot weeks before the general election so that, in the event of a runoff, their vote would have already been mailed in. </p> <p class=\"\">This keeps SB 202 in compliance with a federal law requiring that overseas and military absentee voters be mailed their ballots 45 days before a federal election.</p> <p class=\"\">Because of the condensed time frame between the general election and the runoff, many Georgia voters will also be looking at a shortened, five-day, weekday-only period of early in-person voting.</p> <p class=\"\">Plus, due to an ongoing lawsuit against the state, it remains uncertain whether one Saturday early voting day, on Nov. 26, will be allowed.</p> <p class=\"\">SB 202 stipulates that early in-person voting must end the Friday before the runoff. This year, that would be Friday Dec. 2. </p> <p class=\"\">The law, as interpreted by the Georgia secretary of state\u2019s office,<strong> </strong>also stipulates that early in-person voting not be held on any Saturday that follows a \u201cpublic or legal holiday\u201d on the preceding Thursday or Friday. This year, that would mean there would be no early in-person voting on Nov. 26, the Saturday following Thanksgiving. </p> <p class=\"\">But a Fulton County judge <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/win-democrats-georgia-judge-allows-early-voting-senate-runoff-saturday-rcna57983\" target=\"_blank\">ruled Friday that the office</a> cannot prohibit counties from allowing voting that day, after a voting rights group, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/15/us/politics/warnock-early-voting-georgia.html\" target=\"_blank\">along with Warnock</a> and his campaign, <a href=\"https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/democrats-sue-georgia-over-early-voting-guidance-for-senate-runoff/\">sued</a> the state, claiming  the specific language of the law suggested that the barring of Saturday voting after a holiday \u2014 in this case Thanksgiving \u2014 doesn\u2019t actually apply to runoff elections.</p> <p class=\"\">Georgia\u2019s attorney general plans to appeal, a spokesperson for the office told NBC News. As a result, whether counties can offer voting that day remains in limbo.</p> <p class=\"\">If voting is ultimately not allowed on that Saturday, SB 202 says Saturday voting should be held the previous weekend (in this year\u2019s case, Saturday, Nov. 19). But under Georgia law, runoff voting may not begin until after officials have certified the general election vote, which will be on Monday, Nov. 21, per the Georgia Secretary of State\u2019s office. That means, no Saturday voting will be allowed on Nov. 19, either. </p> <p class=\"\">Whether the judiciary allows voting on Nov. 26 or not, the only other days most voters will  be able to vote early in-person will be from Monday Nov. 28 to Friday Dec. 2. The law states that early voting \u201cshall end on the Friday immediately prior to each primary, election, or runoff.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">That five-day period, however, represents the minimum required under the law, and county election officials have the discretion to schedule additional early-in person voting days that comply with the law's other rules, Lang and Garber and others said.</p> <p class=\"\">Voting rights groups have pushed Georgia counties, for example, to open early-in person voting on Nov. 22, 23 and 27 (the Tuesday and Wednesday before Thanksgiving and the Sunday after). As of Friday, at least nine of the state's 159 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GabrielSterling/status/1593622135716470784\" target=\"_blank\">counties</a> had <a href=\"https://www.cobbcounty.org/elections/voting/advance-voting\" target=\"_blank\">opened up Nov. 27</a> for early voting, and a smaller handful <a href=\"https://www.celebratedouglascounty.com/545/Advance-Voting\" target=\"_blank\">opened </a>it up for Nov. 22 and 23.<strong> </strong></p> <p class=\"\">During the 2020 runoff election, many voters had a period of several weeks to vote early in person \u2014 and all had the possibility to do so on at least on one Saturday.</p> <p class=\"\">Voting rights experts warn that SB 202\u2019s restrictions on drop boxes will also affect the ease with which many absentee voters can drop off their ballots.</p> <p class=\"\">The law says such drop boxes can be located only inside election offices, and early voting locations and are available only during the office or polling site's hours of operation.</p> <p class=\"\">This year, these drop boxes will be available only during early in-person voting. In the counties that adhere to the minimum requirement \u2014 Monday to Friday the week before the election \u2014 those same limitations will also affect drop-box access. How the judiciary rules on the Nov. 26 issue would also be a factor here.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cIn 2020, if you had had an absentee ballot and were worried whether it would arrive at an election office on time, you could go drop of it off on a Saturday,\" said Rahul Garabadu, a senior voting rights attorney at the Georgia American Civil Liberties Union. \"But now because of SB 202, you can only do that during the hours of early voting, which can often be a regular 9-to-5.\"</p> <p class=\"\">As a result, he suggested, more people may choose to mail in their ballot instead \u2014 a fact that then brings into play any potential postal delays.</p> <p class=\"endmark\">\u201cAll of these provisions interact with each other,\u201d Garabadu said. \u201cWhen they combine, you see a cumulative effect on voters, which makes it tougher to cast their ballots.\u201d</p>"},

If he runs, that announcement isn\u2019t expected to come until summer at the earliest \u2014 probably after Florida\u2019s legislative session ends in June \u2014 which will give him time to gauge his own chances.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cHe\u2019s not in a hurry because he doesn\u2019t have to be. And he has a day job: governor,\u201d said one top Florida Republican who was in regular contact with DeSantis throughout his 2022 re-election campaign and spoke anonymously to relay how he believes DeSantis is thinking.</p> <p class=\"\">Dan Eberhart, a Republican fundraiser who once backed Trump but now wants DeSantis to be the party\u2019s nominee in 2024, said there's time.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cIf Trump is going to be in, I would like for him not to be the only national Republican candidate out there,\u201d Eberhart said. \u201cBut DeSantis isn\u2019t going to get in until after the Florida legislative session ends, at least. Anyone that gets in now runs the risk of peaking too early.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">The two-part early conclusion drawn by many GOP insiders is that the only way to beat Trump is by unifying around a single alternative and that DeSantis is the best of the rest.</p> <p class=\"\">That\u2019s why the timing calculations are a bit more complicated for the lower-polling candidates, who also have to worry that the race quickly becomes a clash of titans between Trump and DeSantis with little available space for also-rans. The questions of whether and when to jump in are inexorably linked, as windows of opportunity can open and close at a moment\u2019s notice.</p> <p class=\"\">Trump\u2019s early announcement for president \u2014 which he almost made before the midterm elections last week \u2014 followed nearly two years of planning, fundraising and speeches. His interest in announcing a presidential bid intensified last year when President Joe Biden\u2019s approval ratings dropped amid the souring economy and chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Aides say his desire to run became even more earnest as he increasingly saw DeSantis as a threat and, then, as the Department of Justice opened two separate criminal investigations into him over his role in the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol and his possession and storage of sensitive documents that the federal government says he improperly handled in his post-presidency.</p> <p class=\"\">But others aren\u2019t feeling Trump\u2019s urgency.</p> <p class=\"\">Since Trump\u2019s Tuesday speech, there have been more signs of movement in the invisible primary \u2014 the behind-the-scenes battle to line up donors, endorsers and top staff \u2014 than a rush to launch.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cPeople are either waiting or scrambling to get as close to DeSantis\u2019 inner circle as possible \u2014 or they\u2019re with Trump,\u201d Eberhart said of the donor class.</p> <p class=\"\">In the world of GOP elites, the field is quickly narrowing to Trump and DeSantis, and the Florida Republican source said there is something unique about their rivalry.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThe fact is Ron is different from any other Republican who might run against Trump,\u201d the Republican said. \u201cRon is in Trump\u2019s head. The other guys aren\u2019t. Ron made a red wave in the state when it didn\u2019t materialize really anywhere else. He won by a historic margin. And billionaires are basically begging him to run.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">In addition to the celebrity from his big re-election win of nearly 20 points, DeSantis has an edge over some of the other possible non-Trump candidates: money. His political and campaign committees had at least $64 million in the bank, according to the most recent campaign finance data.</p> <p class=\"\">DeSantis continued to fundraise after the election but has no immediately known plans to convert the state political committee into a federal super PAC that could support his federal candidacy.</p> <p class=\"\">Florida also has a so-called resign to run law that would require DeSantis, if he qualifies to run for president, to resign as governor after the 2024 election \u2014 whether or not he wins the presidency. Legislative allies are expected to change the law during the spring lawmaking session but they\u2019re \u201cwaiting on smoke signals from the Plaza Level,\u201d said a knowledgeable legislative source referring to the Tallahassee shorthand for the location of the governor\u2019s office on the first floor of the state Capitol.</p> <p class=\"\">One reason for the other hopefuls to wait outside the ring is the hope that Trump and DeSantis bloody each other badly enough to turn the title fight into a battle royal.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Former Vice President Mike Pence, who needs no introduction to voters, is on a book tour. In fact, his book came out on the same day as Trump\u2019s big announcement. He didn\u2019t watch Trump\u2019s launch speech Tuesday, according to an aide, and has said he could wait until the spring to announce whether he will run.</p> <p class=\"\">Like DeSantis, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin is expected to keep his focus on state matters, possibly until Virginia\u2019s legislative session ends in February.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">But Youngkin maintained a robust schedule on behalf of Republican candidates in the midterms, earning chits in key states, and he has a growing list of prominent GOP donors ready to back him should he join the race.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Trump appears to have noticed, targeting the governor with <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/donald-trump-blasts-out-racist-attack-on-virginia-gov-glenn-youngkin\">a racist, somewhat confusing, attack</a> on his social media platform.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, long viewed as having eyes on the presidency, made critical remarks of Trump on Wednesday in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/16/us/politics/trump-republicans-alternatives.html\" target=\"_blank\">The New York Times</a>. But in a <a href=\"https://rumble.com/v1v70qu-sd-governor-kristi-noem-republicans-must-embrace-the-ideals-and-history-tha.html\" target=\"_blank\">\"War Room\" podcast</a> interview on Thursday with former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, she walked back the remarks and issued a mild criticism of DeSantis for briefly locking down Florida during spring break when the Covid pandemic first hit in 2020.</p> <p class=\"\">The better known a potential candidate is, the longer he or she can afford to wait. It takes more time and money for more obscure hopefuls to become familiar to voters. The GOP primary electorate is familiar with Trump and Pence from their time in the White House, and, to a lesser extent, DeSantis and even Youngkin a bit from their recent high-profile gubernatorial wins.</p> <p class=\"\">The Pence aide says there\u2019s no concern in his camp that anti-Trump donors will all flock to DeSantis.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cI think that the donor base is so large that that is not a threat; I don\u2019t think there could be that level of consolidation,\u201d the Pence aide said, pointing to loyalty among the former vice president\u2019s contributors that transcends pure political calculation. \u201cThere are elements of the donor base that I think he appeals to because of his faith and his devotion in that faith that other candidates don\u2019t really appeal to.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">But would-be candidates who haven\u2019t been in the political arena as recently \u2014 former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie among them \u2014 may have to make their decisions a little more quickly. Few are tipping their hands now.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThe secretary hasn\u2019t made a final decision about whether or not he will run,\u201d a person close to Pompeo said. \u201cBut that decision will be based on if he thinks it is the best place for him to serve and if the timing is correct.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Christie is <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2022/11/15/chris-christie-trump-governors\">clearly eager to hammer Trump</a>, but it\u2019s not clear whether that will be as a candidate or perhaps as a commentator on television. He is \u201copen to\u201d a run, said longtime adviser Mike DuHaime, who added that Christie will not jump in \u201cunless he sees a path\u201d to the nomination. Either way, DuHaime said, Trump\u2019s entry has no effect on Christie\u2019s thinking and no decision is imminent.</p> <p class=\"\">Trump\u2019s team has long held the position that he\u2019s expecting other Republicans to run against him and that, if a critical number of primary challengers line up, it would make his candidacy even more formidable.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cWe have at least 30% of the Republican primary electorate that will do anything to support the [former] president. And the value of their votes becomes proportionately higher if a bunch of others pile in the race and dilute the not-Trump vote and divide it up between them,\u201d said one Trump strategist who spoke anonymously to share the campaign\u2019s thinking.</p> <p class=\"\">In the days since Trump\u2019s launch, his campaign has released a string of endorsements from lawmakers. But the number is much lower than the set that he endorsed in the recent midterm elections, and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., dodged this week when he was asked whether he backs Trump for president.</p> <p class=\"\">Steven Cheung, the communications director for Trump\u2019s campaign, said that the former president believes \u201cAmerica is in decline due to the weak leadership of Joe Biden,\u201d adding that \u201cthere are others who will be bound to the political establishment, be beholden to corporations and drag the United States into more unnecessary wars.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Brad Todd, a veteran Republican strategist, said it makes more sense for hopefuls to take their time for a variety of logistical reasons, including federal fundraising limits that are imposed once a candidacy becomes official. But more than that, he said, Republican voters are exhausted.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cCampaigns have gotten bigger and rougher and louder, and I think voters reach a capacity when they need a break,\u201d Todd said. \u201cMy advice for anyone running for anything in 2024 right now would be let the voters have their holiday.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">One GOP strategist who worked for Trump in the past said that DeSantis would be smart to stay out and let the former president see how much his own support has dissipated even without a big rival in the race.</p> <p class=\"endmark\">\u201cIf he\u2019s not in, it will just drive Trump crazy,\u201d the strategist said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have all these donors, all these folks waiting for DeSantis and that\u2019s going to be their answer [when Trump asks for help]. And that\u2019s just going to twist the knife.\u201d\u00a0</p>"},

Gary Peters, of Michigan, said in an interview at Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee headquarters.</p> <p class=\"\">And as <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-announce-president-2024-rcna36987\" target=\"_blank\">Trump announces a 2024 presidential run</a>, Peters says his dominance over the GOP will come at a cost \u2014 unless Republicans reject the former president, who stirred up a mob that attacked the Capitol, and his brand of politics.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cIt depends what the party does. If the party continues to be following the Trump model and is Trumpian and doesn\u2019t go back to their more conservative roots of the traditional Republican Party, I will say, definitely that\u2019ll be a problem,\u201d he said.</p> <p class=\"\">Peters entered the 2022 cycle with a daunting task: to preserve the thinnest possible majority in what is typically a losing year for a party in control of the White House and Congress, a task made even more daunting this year by a president underwater in his approval rating and widespread economic pain throughout the country.</p> <p class=\"\">Democrats defied gravity, clinching 50 Senate seats and losing no incumbents. They can make it 51 in the <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/gop-starts-boosting-walkers-runoff-calls-keep-trump-away-georgia-rcna56514\" target=\"_blank\">Dec. 6 Georgia runoff</a> if Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock finishes ahead of Republican rival Herschel Walker again, as he did in the general election. The GOP's failure to recapture the Senate <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/republican-infighting-escalates-poor-2022-election-results-trump-re-em-rcna57540\" target=\"_blank\">has led to recriminations</a> and a dispute about whether Trump was to blame for their underperformance. </p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThis is historic,\u201d Peters said. \u201cFor the party in power in the White House, and given where we are with inflation and other factors, to not lose a seat right now \u2014 I believe we will gain a seat \u2014 is truly historic.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Peters insists he never bought in to the GOP boasts of a red wave. He ignored projections that the fundamentals of the midterms would swamp Democratic senators in states like Nevada, Arizona and New Hampshire. \u201cOur numbers were actually pretty consistent,\u201d he said. \u201cWe knew we were going in a tough environment.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Apart from Trump, Peters said <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/inflation-abortion-lead-list-voter-concerns-nbc-news-exit-poll-finds-rcna56258\" target=\"_blank\">abortion was a motivating factor</a> for suburban voters and credited the party\u2019s \u201cunprecedented\u201d early investments in ground operations for the win, adding \u201cthe attacks on democracy\u201d from \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/election-deniers-overwhelmingly-lost-battleground-states-rcna57058\" target=\"_blank\">the election denial folks</a>\u201d had an impact. \u201cPeople do care about that in this country. It was particularly evident in suburban areas.\u201d Peters said.</p> <p class=\"\">There are difficult lessons for Democrats, too. Peters conceded that his party has a problem in rural areas \u2014 which trended even further away from his party in the 2022 cycle \u2014 and needs to show up with \u201ca robust rural agenda\u201d that is meaningful to voters there.</p> <p class=\"\">Peters has been the antithesis of Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., his counterpart who runs the Republican campaign arm. While Scott began the cycle with bold predictions of a 2010-style \"red wave,\" the soft-spoken Michigan Democrat stayed out of the limelight. While Scott <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/sen-rick-scotts-agenda-seen-challenge-mcconnell-gop-rcna17435\" target=\"_blank\">broke ranks with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/mcconnell-rejects-senate-gop-election-head-rick-scotts-2022-agenda-rcna18176\" target=\"_blank\">released a controversial agenda</a> that became fodder for Democratic attack ads, Peters says he worked in lockstep with Majority Leader Chuck Schumer throughout the cycle.</p> <p class=\"\">Now, Scott and McConnell are engaged in an <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/mcconnell-re-elected-senate-gop-leader-defeating-challenge-rick-scott-rcna57487\" target=\"_blank\">ugly public clash</a> over <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/republican-infighting-escalates-poor-2022-election-results-trump-re-em-rcna57540\" target=\"_blank\">why their party failed to win the Senate</a>, with their advisers publicly questioning whether the other is doing enough to help Walker in the Georgia runoff. Scott has sought to align with the Trump wing of the party while the former president persistently attacks McConnell and blames the minority leader for the party's failures in 2022.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll just contrast that to where we are,\u201d said Peters, resisting an opportunity to gloat. \u201cClearly we\u2019re totally united in this race in Georgia. Chuck Schumer and I work very closely together, and are working closely together as a team to ensure that we get to 51.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Peters said the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has committed to spending $7 million in Georgia to help Warnock, \u201cand we\u2019ll continue to make investments in various areas in Georgia going forward.\u201d He added that part of the challenge is to remind voters that Dec. 6 is Election Day, given that it\u2019s not intuitive to many.</p> <p class=\"\">And Trump, again, looms over the runoff. The former president's early endorsement of Walker enabled him to clear the Republican primary field, and he reiterated his support for the former football star in his speech announcing his 2024 presidential candidacy in Florida. \"Despite the outcome in the Senate, we cannot lose hope. And we must all work very hard for a gentleman and a great person named Herschel Walker,\u201d said Trump, who became the first Republican presidential candidate since 1992 to lose Georgia.</p> <p class=\"endmark\">Warnock, sensing an opportunity to mobilize his party\u2019s base, cut that video into a campaign ad and displayed \u201cStop Donald Trump.

This is pure, progressive, power politics,\u201d Kaufmann told NBC News Friday. Kaufmann\u2019s position could complicate the overall schedule even more since New Hampshire has a law on the books that it has to hold its primary just after Iowa\u2019s caucuses.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cIf, for some reason, California and New York dictate policy for the entire DNC and they give the middle finger to Iowa and the Midwest \u2014 if that happens, we will be first,\u201d Kaufmann said. \u201cI\u2019ll move this thing to Halloween if that\u2019s what it takes.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">The caucuses are typically not scheduled until January or early February of the same year as the presidential race.</p> <p class=\"\">Kaufmann also laid into President Biden\u2019s agriculture secretary, Tom Vilsack, a onetime presidential contender and former Iowa governor, saying he and other Democratic leaders weren\u2019t doing enough to preserve Iowa\u2019s first place in line. Vilsack did not respond to a request for comment. Kaufmann argued it was detrimental to the entire system if Democrats pulled out of Iowa as a first-in-the-nation caucus since the two parties typically agree to hold their caucuses on the same day.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Iowa\u2019s Democratic Party Chair Ross Wilburn noted that even if Democrats put the state later, Republicans would still be campaigning in Iowa early<strong> </strong>and testing their messages to rural voters, putting Democrats at a disadvantage with that electorate if they abandon the smaller state.\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cWe can\u2019t allow our presidential campaigns to be solely decided by campaigns that can only afford TV ads or by corporate special interest groups who have the funds to pay for their candidate to get exposure in larger media markets,\u201d Wilburn said. \u201cWe believe we need to have small rural states like Iowa, in the mix.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">The discussion comes after Democrats scrapped the old calendar and opened up the process so all states could apply to be early contenders. That old system began with the Iowa caucuses, then went to the New Hampshire primary, Nevada and South Carolina.\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">These early positions are prized since they create an economic bump in states that are flooded with advertising dollars and on-the-ground organizations.\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Dozens of states have now applied to take one of the early state positions.\u00a0They include all of the states that have previously gone early, while Nevada is attempting to replace New Hampshire as the first-in-the-nation primary.

{"title": "Home heating costs are on the rise but government assistance is running short", "content": "<p class=\"\">WASHINGTON \u2014 As winter temperatures arrive across America,  government officials are bracing for a surge of households unable to pay rising winter heating bills, and dwindling resources available to help cover the costs.</p> <p class=\"\">For the average household, home heating costs are <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/report/winterfuels.php#:~:text=The%20residential%20natural%20gas%20price,of%202022%20compared%20with%202021.\" target=\"_blank\">projected</a> to rise <strong> </strong>28% \u2014 on top of double-digit increases last year \u2014 driven largely by the disruption to energy markets caused by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and surging demand for fossil fuels. At the same time, federally funded programs to help low-income households with those bills will have 42% less money this winter after the billions of dollars in Covid stimulus available last winter runs out.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">The surge in demand and drop in aid is causing concern throughout state and federal governments. In anticipation, the White House has taken a three-prong approach the past year, said an administration official: It has urged oil companies to bolster their stockpiles; make funds available to weatherize homes and make them more energy efficient; and prepare for further releases from the country's petroleum or heating oil reserves. </p> <p class=\"\">But temperatures are already dropping and the number of households seeking assistance is already on the rise, according to interviews with more than a half dozen officials involved in programs that provide heating assistance. </p> <p class=\"\">\u201cWe\u2019re already seeing record numbers of requests this season for utility assistance and really the heating season is just beginning,\u201d said Scott Kelly, general secretary of the Massachusetts division of the Salvation Army, an international charitable organization. \u201cOur social workers are seeing people who have never needed to ask for help before, so it\u2019s definitely concerning to us. We are very concerned about what the future will hold this heating season.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Americans are getting squeezed financially on a number of other fronts with inflation that has shown little signs of abating, and the end to a number of pandemic-era assistance programs, such as the emergency rental assistance funding and the child tax credit that provided hundreds of dollars a month to households before it expired last year.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Kelly said the Salvation Army in Massachusetts has received twice as many applications as it did this time last year for its winter heating assistance program, which is aimed at those whose incomes are too high to qualify for federal assistance.</p> <p class=\"\">One of those seeking help this winter is Malonie Bernard. She said her family has been struggling to pay its utility bills with a single income from her fianc\u00e9 after she left her job at a nursing home during the pandemic to take care of her three children.\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">As the temperatures have dipped into the 20s at night in her hometown of Fitchburg, she has yet to turn on the gas heat in her apartment. </p> <p class=\"\">Instead, her 9- and 12-year-old children sleep under multiple blankets in heavy pajamas and some nights she uses her body heat to keep her 11-month-old baby warm. She strategically uses space heaters, is sure to use the oven instead of the stove, and times her laundry so the dryer will help warm the house in the evening.</p> <p class=\"\">Each month, Bernard says she has to juggle what bills to pay and what ones to delay as costs have kept rising. Over the summer her electric bill for her seven-room apartment shot up to $700 one month, it had previously never gone above $200, and she\u2019s run up  an unpaid balance of about $1,000. For the winter, she\u2019s anticipating her gas bill will be well above last winter\u2019s of $600 a month \u2014 money her family doesn\u2019t have in their budget.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s hard. It\u2019s so hard asking for help, but at this point, we have no choice,\u201d said Bernard. \u201cWe feel bad, as if we\u2019re taking it from someone else who really, really needs it. So we try to push it, but I said this year, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to be able to push it.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">In Colorado, the demand for assistance through the federally funded Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, know as LIHEAP, is expected to far outstrip the demand, said Theresa Kullen, who manages the program in Colorado. Kullen said she expects applications to be up 10% this winter on top of the 10% increase they saw last year.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cWe\u2019re very concerned about how much we can do because we know it\u2019s not enough, there\u2019s just not enough money to do what we need to do,\u201d said Kullen. \u201cWith the pandemic relief funds we were able to do so much good, and that money is now gone. And so we are taking a step backwards.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">But many of those who apply this year will find far less help available to them now that pandemic-era programs have run dry.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cIf Congress doesn\u2019t step in and find some way to help the bottom third of the population pay these bills you\u2019ll see more suffering and they\u2019ll just be poor instead of being working class, and that\u2019s what they\u2019re afraid of, working-class families are afraid of becoming poor,\u201d said Mark Wolfe, \u00a0executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. \u201cYou no longer have what makes you feel lower middle class, you now feel poor, and that\u2019s what\u2019s happening across the board with these inflationary increases, and it\u2019s subtle, it\u2019s quiet.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Congress has allocated $4.8 billion for heating assistance this winter through the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which is $1 billion more than pre-pandemic funding levels. But that will be far less than the $8.3 billion available last year with the addition of Covid relief funds.</p> <p class=\"\">Despite the extra assistance last year, 20 million households are already behind on their utility bills owing a total of $16 billion in overdue payments \u2014 an average of $800 per household, <a href=\"https://neada.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/20millionbehindPR.pdf\">according to NEADA</a>. That\u2019s up from $8 billion in utility bill debt at the start of the pandemic.</p> <p class=\"\">Energy costs are on the rise for a range of reasons. Prices for natural gas, the most common form of winter heating in the U.S., are projected to rise 28% this winter, largely because of increased demand in Europe following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, according to the Energy Information Administration.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">The price of heating oil, which is widely used in New England, is expected to be up 27% this winter, and it will cost the average home $1,000 more this winter for heating oil than two years ago, <a href=\"https://neada.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/20millionbehindPR.pdf\">according to NEADA</a>. Heating oil prices are linked to the price of crude oil, which has been increasing as a result of surging demand following the pandemic, limited refinery capacity and uncertainty in the markets from Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.</p> <p class=\"\">In Maine, where the majority of households rely on heating oil, officials have seen a 10% uptick in applications so far this year for its heating assistance program that provided help to 40,000 households last year. Without the Covid stimulus money this year, Maine will provide benefits to around the same number of households, but the amount they receive will be about half of last year\u2019s benefit, said Scott Thistle, a spokesman for MaineHousing.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cLast winter, we were able to provide about a tank and a half of heating benefit. This year, we\u2019re going to be able to provide them with less than a tank. Maybe if we\u2019re lucky, depending on the price of oil, we\u2019ll get two-thirds or a half a tank so it just doesn\u2019t go as far,\u201d said Thistle.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">The cost of heating oil has been a particular concern for the Biden administration, said the government official. Biden and Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm have been urging oil companies to cut exports of diesel, which is chemically the same as heating oil, to keep more in the U.S. to build up stockpiles in the Northeast in case there are supply disruptions or colder-than-expected weather that leads to a surge in demand.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Heating oil and diesel inventories are at their lowest levels on record for this time of year.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">The administration is also prepared to tap into the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve, which has about 1 million barrels of heating oil, if necessary, the administration officials said.</p> <p class=\"\">The White House announced earlier this month it was also distributing $9 billion from the Inflation Reduction Act passed earlier this year to help 1.6 million households upgrade their homes to lower energy bills, like providing rebates to purchase a new electric stove, install new insulation or energy efficient appliances. The administration is also distributing $3.16\u00a0billion from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to retrofit thousands of low-incomes homes to make them more energy efficient while lowering utility bills, including installing insulation and updating heating and cooling systems.</p> <p class=\"endmark\">Longer term, the Biden administration is looking for ways to expand heat pump use and manufacturing in the U.S. and develop programs to improve building energy efficiency, according to an announcement earlier this month. </p>"},

Justice Department officials contended that releasing any more information about their evidence and witnesses in the case could jeopardize their ongoing criminal investigation and the safety of witnesses.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cIf disclosed, the affidavit would serve as a roadmap to the government\u2019s ongoing investigation, providing specific details about its direction and likely course, in a manner that is highly likely to compromise future investigative steps,\u201d prosecutors said in an August court filing.</p> <p class=\"\">In their court filing Tuesday, Trump's attorneys said they and their client must be able to review the document to know whether their rights to reasonable search and seizure were violated, and brushed aside the government's concerns.</p> <p class=\"\">\"The entire matter has played out in the media, overwhelmingly because of the Government\u2019s leaks. There is no concern regarding disclosure of the scope and direction of the investigation; nor is there any prospect of witness intimidation,\" the filing said, because the unredacted document wouldn't be shared publicly.</p> <p class=\"\">A spokesperson for the Justice Department declined to comment. </p> <p class=\"\">Trump has been accused of witness tampering and intimidation before. The House committee investigating the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol suggested earlier this year that Trump allies had been trying to <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/jan-6-panel-warns-attempts-influence-witnesses-trump-allies-rcna35800\" target=\"_blank\">influence witnesses</a> in their probe, and as president, Trump was accused of trying to<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/trump-tweeted-marie-yovanovitch-testified-was-it-witness-tampering-n1084176\" target=\"_blank\"> intimidate witnesses </a>testifying in his first impeachment trial, as well as trying to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-ap-top-news-elections-james-comey-north-america-e0d125d737be4a21a81bec3d9f1dffd8\" target=\"_blank\">influence witnesses</a> in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, including by dangling the prospect of a presidential pardon.</p> <p class=\"\">While Trump publicly called for the affidavit to be unsealed in August, the Tuesday filing was the first time his lawyers formally asked Cannon to unseal the unredacted version.</p> <p class=\"\">The magistrate judge who signed off on the search warrant, Bruce Reinhart, released a redacted version of the affidavit in late August that kept under wraps the information the government was concerned about becoming public. It showed that Trump had been hoarding classified documents since he left the White House in Jan. 2021. </p> <p class=\"\">The request to Cannon came shortly before lawyers for Trump and the Justice Department faced off over Trump's lawsuit in the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.</p> <p class=\"\">The Justice Department asked the appeals court to dismiss Cannon's order appointing a special master in the case which blocked investigators from using thousands of documents recovered in their Aug. 8 search as part of their probe until the review is done. Lawyers for DOJ argued a narrower appeal from the same order earlier this year, charging the judge <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/appeals-court-lifts-hold-prevented-justice-department-using-classified-rcna48862\" target=\"_blank\">overstepped </a>when she barred the feds from reviewing classified documents seized in the search until the special master review was completed. </p> <p class=\"\">The appeals court ruled in DOJ's favor in September.</p> <p class=\"\">The three-judge panel that heard the case Tuesday seemed highly skeptical of Trump's arguments to allow the case to proceed, noting that a ruling in his favor could open the floodgates for similar challenges from anyone who's the target of a federal investigation. </p> <p class=\"\">One of the judges also seemed unimpressed by Trump lawyer Jim Trusty's complaint that extraordinary action was needed in this case because federal investigators had gathered up personal items like pictures of singer Celine Dion while they were executing a search warrant for government documents.</p> <p class=\"\">\"This is a situation where a political rival has been subjected to a search warrant\u00a0where thousands of personal materials have been taken,\u201d Trusty said. </p> <p class=\"\">One of the judges responded that \u201cthe search warrant was for classified documents and boxes and other items that are intermingled with them. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily the fault of the government\u00a0if someone has intermingled classified documents and all kinds of personal property.\"\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">If the appeals court were to grant the government's bid to dismiss the underlying challenge, that would effectively make the Trump motion moot, since it is a part of that case. </p> <p class=\"endmark\">  </p>"},

Abortion providers who had resumed performing the procedure past six weeks after the lower court ruling will again have to stop.</p> <p class=\"\">The order said seven of the nine justices had agreed to the decision. It said one was disqualified and another did not participate.</p> <p class=\"\">Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney ruled on November 15 that\u00a0the state\u2019s abortion ban was invalid\u00a0because when it was signed into law in 2019, U.S. Supreme Court precedent under Roe. v.

{"title": "Black voters in Louisiana \u2018embarrassed\u2019 by state\u2019s failure to pass anti-slavery amendment", "content": "<p class=\"\">Black voters in Louisiana are confused. Many are embarrassed. Some are angry. All seem to be concerned about how their state is being perceived after a constitutional amendment to eliminate slavery and forced indentured servitude failed to <a href=\"https://greekreporter.com/2022/11/12/louisiana-voted-slavery/\">pass</a> in the November election.</p> <p class=\"\">That may be, in part, because the lawmaker who authored the bill to allow the vote switched direction and worked to kill it.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Four other states \u2014 Alabama, Oregon, Tennessee and Vermont \u2014 passed similar legislation, effectively ending \u201cslave labor\u201d in prisons. Louisiana, however, did not vote for the constitutional amendment, which had been introduced by Rep. Edmond Jordan, a Black politician known for fighting for Black people\u2019s causes, like <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/louisiana-police-government-and-politics-17e06976acab34fff0f91366348a5a48\">limiting police officers\u2019 immunity in civil </a>lawsuits.</p> <p class=\"\">In an unusual twist, Jordan initiated a campaign last summer for an amendment he authored to fail. His original bill read, \u201cSlavery and involuntary servitude are prohibited.\u201d With that language, it was clear the bill would have wiped out the 138-year-old exception in Louisiana\u2019s Constitution that allowed involuntary servitude as punishment for a crime.</p> <p class=\"\">But Jordan agreed to an addendum to the bill, which said that the part of the constitution that \u201cprohibited slavery and involuntary servitude\u201d did not \u201capply to the otherwise lawful administration of criminal justice.\u201d That section, Jordan said, created confusion for him and voters and made some question whether the second part of the bill was \u201ccanceling out the first part.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cAre they trying to trick us into voting for slavery?\u201d asked John Miles, a 41-year-old Black truck driver in Monroe. \u201cWhy would they make it so confusing?\u201d He said he voted no because of the lack of clarity.</p> <p class=\"\">Ultimately, the amendment<a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Louisiana_Amendment_7,_Remove_Involuntary_Servitude_as_Punishment_for_a_Crime_from_Constitution_Measure_(2022)\"> failed</a>, with 61% voting no.</p> <p class=\"\">Jordan was fine with the amendment not passing, even though many Black voters disagreed. The measure received <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/11/08/us/elections/results-louisiana-constitutional-amendment-7-remove-constitutional-language-allowing-slavery-as-punishment.html\">more \u201cno\u201d votes than \u201cyes\u201d in all 64 parishes</a> in the state. Some of those voters, like Todd L. Sterling of Baton Rouge, say the measure passing would have represented progress rather than leaving slavery and indentured servitude in place. Its failure signifies remnants of a time many would like to forget.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cIt was a tricky bill to read if you had not done a little homework,\u201d said Sterling, owner of <a href=\"http://alphamediapr.com/\">Alpha Media and Public Relations</a>, an advertising agency in the state capital. \u201cIt really pertains to the penal system in Louisiana, renting people out, which is modern-day slavery. If you weren\u2019t up on the subject, and you weren\u2019t familiar with how the penal system treats the incarcerated like slaves, you wouldn\u2019t really think that it was a big issue.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">But it is in Louisiana, where inmates engage in \u201cslave labor\u201d at its state penitentiary nicknamed Angola after the former plantation on which the prison was built. According to a<a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/report/captive-labor-exploitation-incarcerated-workers?redirect=captivelabor\"> report</a> by the American Civil Liberties Union and University of Chicago Law School Global Human Rights Clinic, prisoners there earn between 2 cents and 20 cents an <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2022/11/10/angola-prison-louisiana-slave-labor/\">hour</a>, with many working in the fields on crops like sugarcane, corn, soybeans and, yes, cotton.</p> <p class=\"\">And Black inmates make up 74% of the Angola prison population.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cField laborers work with limited access to water, minimal rest and no restroom facilities, under the supervision of armed correctional officers on horseback,\u201d the ACLU report said.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cAnd that\u2019s why this bill was important,\u201d Sterling, 56, added. \u201cOf course, I voted for the bill because it\u2019s long past the time we eliminate any possibility of what\u2019s going on at Angola. That should have been a slam dunk. But now we\u2019re the only state that has something like on the books\u2026 And that\u2019s embarrassing.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Jordan said he wanted his bill to fail so he could reintroduce it at the next legislative session, in April 2023, with easy-to-understand language. He feared there was potential for a lawmaker to use the confusing language as an opportunity to legalize slavery in Louisiana and keep indentured servitude.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cI wasn\u2019t even going to take the chance of some ambiguous language being used and brought to court to try to do the opposite of what we intended,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cLook at it this way: If the amendment failed, on Nov. 9, we\u2019d be no worse off than when we were on Nov. 8. But there\u2019s a potential that we could have been worse if it had passed. \u2026 So, we need to go back to the drawing board and make sure that the language is clear so everybody knows exactly what the intent is.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">However, some voters remain perplexed and disheartened that, even with the language, a measure that began with ending slavery and indentured servitude did not pass.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing. It\u2019s terrible,\u201d said Robert Diggs, an attorney in Atlanta from Lafayette, Louisiana. \u201cI don\u2019t see how there can be an excuse for confusing language on a bill, especially one as important as this. This needs to be corrected as soon as possible because slavery in any form of indentured servitude should not be legal anywhere in this country and much less than the world.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Curt Simmons, an international foreign language teacher, said he paused when he reached the part of the ballot that asked about the controversial amendment. Simmons had recently returned to Shreveport from Prague and was unaware of the issues.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cMy first thought was: \u2018Am I reading this right?\u2019 I mean, we\u2019re talking about slavery in 2022?\u201d Simmons said. \u201cI looked around, like \u2018Does anyone else see this?\u2019 To see that on the ballot was shocking.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">What made matters even worse was that he was unsure of how to vote. Finally, he said, he voted \u201cyes. I was fearful that a \u2018no\u2019 vote would support keeping it as it is, and I\u2019m not down for that at all. It\u2019s really sad and makes me angry that we\u2019re still dealing with this.

But the surfeit of well-funded groups shows eagerness among Democratic donors to defend Biden \u2014 or at least stop Trump \u2014 and a recognition that the fight over public opinion is at least as important as the legal one, since it will lay the groundwork for the next campaign.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s important that the opposition not get the upper hand in defining a false narrative, and outside groups can help mitigate that from happening,\" Elrod noted.</p> <p class=\"\">The White House itself has been preparing for months for the barrage of inquiries, adding both legal and public relations  firepower to the White House Counsel\u2019s Office, which is quarterbacking its effort, and encouraging federal agencies to take similar moves.</p> <p class=\"\">This summer, as it looked likely that Republicans would win one or both chambers of Congress, a small group of White House staffers began mapping out likely investigative angles, keeping close tabs on top Republican investigators, including letters of inquiry they sent to federal agencies.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThere are a lot of constraints on the administration when responding to oversight investigations \u2014 even ones that are completely bogus \u2014 but none of which apply to outside groups,\u201d said Eric Schultz, a former Obama White House spokesperson who tangled daily with Republican congressional investigators ahead of President Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 re-election bid.</p> <p class=\"\">For instance, government officials are prohibited by federal law from politicking. And the White House prefers to stay above the political fray, anyway. So, outside groups can provide political and PR support, especially in the absence of a Biden campaign, and can get down into the mud on especially sensitive issues like Hunter Biden.</p> <p class=\"\">Both sides insist they\u2019re just after the truth. But the politics of the situation is undeniable and only thinly veiled.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Rep.

You can take Jordan\u2019s word at it,\u201d said Kyle Herrig, the founder and executive director of one of the new war rooms, the Congressional Integrity Project, which is relaunching to counter the investigations. \u201cThey don\u2019t have an agenda that will help Americans. They have only one agenda and it\u2019s a political agenda.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">The <a href=\"https://congressionalintegrity.org/\">Congressional Integrity Project</a>, which already has focus groups underway, promises to be as much about offense as defense. It plans to investigate the lawmakers investigating Biden, many of whom hail from the safe congressional districts and have never faced a tough election and the kind of opposition research and media scrutiny it brings.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cWe\u2019re going to leave no stone unturned. No one has done the investigative research we\u2019ve done on these investigators. People in glass houses shouldn\u2019t throw stones,\u201d Herrig said. \u201cWe have a multimillion-dollar budget, and we\u2019re staffing up with a team of researchers and communicators.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Herrig\u2019s group is working with another, <a href=\"https://courageforamerica.org/\">Courage for America</a>, which just launched. While the Congressional Integrity Project is focused on the investigations, Courage for America is focused on the legislation and personalities of the entire House GOP caucus.</p> <p class=\"\">Among other things, that means making firebrand freshman lawmakers famous. And it means highlighting and mobilizing opposition to GOP policies, such as a proposed national abortion ban and potential cuts to Social Security and Medicare.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThe American people need to be introduced and educated about the extremist agenda of this new House and also who these members are,\u201d said Zac Petkanas, who was the Clinton campaign\u2019s rapid response director and is now running a war room supported by Courage for America. \u201cIt\u2019s a very dangerous new caucus and we\u2019re going to be there every single day making sure people know about it.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">With a seven-figure budget and support from the Hub Project, a giant Democratic dark money network, the group plans a robust operation including polling, paid advertising and social media campaigns, along with traditional opposition research and communications.</p> <p class=\"\">The third group, Facts First, was started by David Brock, the former self-described \u201cright-wing hit man\u201d who then had a political conversion and used his fundraising talent to start a series of groups that have become key parts of Democratic infrastructure. Those include Media Matters and American Bridge, both of which he stepped away from to start Facts First.</p> <p class=\"\">Brock said an American Bridge donor has already pledged six-figures to support Facts First, which he said would likely have a $10 million budget over two years. Co-founders include former Republican Rep. David Jolly, a Trump critic who has since left the party, and longtime Democratic strategist Maria Cardona.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Unlike the other two groups, in order to maintain its independence, Facts First decided not to formally approach the White House for its blessing, though back-channel communications led it to believe the effort is welcome.</p> <p class=\"\">Brock, who also founded the pro-Clinton Correct the Record, said that experience taught him the new group needs to be more aggressive on social media and conduct more opinion research to understand how Americans view the controversy du jour.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cI do believe that, absent a vigorous operation, like the one we\u2019re putting out, I think it makes it difficult for President Biden to be re-elected,\u201d he said, before quickly adding that \u201cit\u2019s the Republicans that are really making this a political issue. We are doing this in response.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Of the new groups, Brock\u2019s appears to be working most closely with Hunter Biden and his legal team, led by entertainment lawyer Kevin Morris.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Hunter Biden\u2019s relationship, struggles with drugs and alcohol, and business efforts to fund it all are sure to be a major focus of Republican inquiries. Republicans have long argued that Biden helped his son\u2019s overseas business dealings \u2014 the claim was at the center of Trump\u2019s first impeachment \u2014 but are still searching for evidence to prove it.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Brock recently traveled to Los Angeles to meet with Hunter Biden and said he came away reassured.</p> <p class=\"endmark\">\u201cI came out of that not nervous. I came out of that thinking that we\u2019ll be able to show, over time, this is a Republican fantasy narrative driven by a lot of unreliable witnesses and spurious conspiracy theories,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, the main story here is of an addictive person who has mental health issues of the kind that are in most families in America. ...

In his NBC interview, Fauci alluded to how his life has been upended. He declined to compare Trump and Biden \u2014 two of the seven presidents he's advised in the course of his career. </p> <p class=\"\">\"I'd prefer not to get into that,\" he said. \"The attacks and blowback I get are just not worth it.\"</p> <p class=\"\">Still, he made it clear that he relished his time advising Biden, who he said is \"completely in favor of sticking with the science, sticking with the facts, and not blaming anything but just going ahead and doing it.\"</p> <p class=\"\">Republicans gained control of the U.S. House in the midterm elections and plan to summon Fauci to testify about his role in combatting the pandemic in the new year.</p> <p class=\"\">Fauci said he would be willing to appear and face what is certain to be hostile questioning.</p> <p class=\"\">\"I have a great deal of respect for the concept of oversight \u2014 legitimate oversight \u2014 and I have no problem testifying before the Congress,\" he said. \"I can explain and defend everything I've done and I have absolutely nothing to hide.\"</p> <p class=\"\">At the press briefing, he was asked to reflect on the course of the virus and said that he did not imagine that the U.S. would see \u201ca three-year saga of suffering and death in a million Americans losing their lives.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThe thing that was most disturbing \u2026 was the continuation of multiple variants evolving over time,\u201d Fauci said.</p> <p class=\"\">Fauci said that he expected the virus to eventually reach low levels in the U.S., but the speed at which the country reaches that point depends on how many people continue to get vaccinated, as well as how many people get an updated booster shot.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cWe can get there with less suffering if we use the interventions that we have,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cIf you want to let nature take its course, we\u2019re ultimately going to get there but we\u2019re going to loose a lot more people than we need to.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Fauci <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/22/us/politics/fauci-retire.html\" target=\"_blank\">does not plan to retire</a>. He told NBC News he is considering various paths that include working in academia, for a foundation or possibly on his own. He said it is \"highly likely\" he will write a book. But in a departure from so many government officials-turned authors in the post-Trump era, he said it wouldn't be a tell-all.</p> <p class=\"endmark\">\"What I would like to do is encourage and perhaps inspire younger people to get involved in science, medicine and public health,\" Fauci said. \"There's a danger of an anti-science movement, and I would hope that I would be able to serve as a bit of encouragement and inspiration to younger people.\"</p>"},

Police said patrons may have prevented more deaths by confronting and disarming the suspect, identified by officials as Anderson Lee Aldrich, 22. The weapon used was in the style of a Colt AR-15, according to Colorado Springs Police Chief Adrian Vasquez.</p> <p class=\"\">The president and first lady Jill Biden on Thursday phoned Club Q's owners, according to the White House. They told the two owners, Nic Grzecka and Matthew Haynes, that they are committed to combating \"hate and gun violence,\" the White House said.</p> <p class=\"\">Biden has a long history with the up-and-down efforts to prohibit the sale of assault-style weapons. As a senator from Delaware in 1994, he helped usher in an assault weapons ban that was credited with <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30188421/\">curbing deaths</a> from mass shootings. The ban expired 10 years later, during the administration of President George W. Bush, and was never renewed.</p> <p class=\"\">Biden<a href=\"https://joebiden.com/gunsafety/\"> promised</a> during his 2020 campaign to outlaw the sale and manufacture of assault weapons, and in a televised town hall event last month, he reiterated that he would make good on that pledge.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cBy the way, I\u2019m going to get an assault weapons ban,\u201d the president <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/not-joke-biden-insists-hell-reinstate-ban-assault-weapons-1750979\" target=\"_blank\">told CNN</a>. \u201cBefore this is over, I\u2019m going to get that again.

Jean Carroll\u2019s lawyer filed the legal papers electronically as\u00a0the Adult Survivor\u2019s Act\u00a0temporarily lifted the state\u2019s usual deadlines for suing over sexual assault. She sought unspecified compensatory and punitive damages for pain and suffering, psychological harms, dignity loss and reputation damage.</p> <p class=\"\">Carroll, a longtime advice columnist for Elle magazine, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-must-sit-deposition-writers-defamation-lawsuit-judge-says-rcna51960\" target=\"_blank\">first made the claim in a 2019 book</a>, saying Trump raped her in the dressing room of a Manhattan luxury department store in 1995 or 1996.</p> <p class=\"\">Trump responded to the book\u2019s allegations by saying\u00a0it could never have happened\u00a0because Carroll was \u201cnot my type.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">His remarks led Carroll to\u00a0file a defamation lawsuit\u00a0against him, but that lawsuit has been tied up in appeals courts as judges decide whether he is protected from legal claims for comments made while he was president.</p> <p class=\"\">Previously, Carroll had been barred by state law from suing over the alleged rape because too many years had passed since the incident.</p> <p class=\"\">New York\u2019s new law, however, gives sex crime victims who missed deadlines associated with statute of limitations a second chance to file a lawsuit. A window for such suits will open for one year, after which the usual time limits will be reinstated.</p> <p class=\"\">At least\u00a0hundreds of lawsuits are expected, including many filed by women who say they were assaulted by co-workers, prison guards, medical providers or others.</p> <p class=\"\">Alina Habba, a lawyer for Trump, said in an email Thursday: \u201cWhile I respect and admire individuals that come forward, this case is unfortunately an abuse of the purpose of this Act which creates a terrible precedent and runs the risk of delegitimizing the credibility of actual victims.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">In her new claims, Carroll maintains that Trump committed battery \u201cwhen he forcibly raped and groped her\u201d and that he defamed her when he denied raping her last month.</p> <p class=\"\">Trump\u00a0said in his statement\u00a0that Carroll \u201ccompletely made up a story that I met her at the doors of this crowded New York City Department Store and, within minutes, \u2018swooned\u2019 her. It is a Hoax and a lie, just like all the other Hoaxes that have been played on me for the past seven years.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Carroll\u2019s new ability to sue Trump for rape could help her sidestep a potentially fatal legal flaw in her original defamation case.</p> <p class=\"\">If the courts ultimately hold that Trump\u2019s original disparaging comments about Carroll\u2019s rape allegation were part of his job duties, as president, she would be barred from suing him over those remarks, as federal employees are protected from defamation claims. No such protection would cover things he did prior to becoming president.</p> <p class=\"\">Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, who presides over the defamation lawsuit Carroll filed three years ago, may decide to include the new claims in a trial likely to occur in the spring.</p> <p class=\"\">Trump\u2019s current lawyers said this week that they do not yet know whether they will represent him against the new allegations.</p> <p class=\"\">Carroll\u2019s attorney, Roberta Kaplan, who is not related to the judge, said at a court hearing this week that the new claims should not require much additional gathering of evidence. She already put a copy of the new claims in the original case file last week. Trump and Carroll also have already been deposed.</p> <p class=\"\">In a statement regarding the new lawsuit, Kaplan said her client \u201cintends to hold Donald Trump accountable not only for defaming her, but also for sexually assaulting her, which he did years ago in a dressing room at Bergdorf Goodman.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThanksgiving Day was the very first day Ms. Carroll could file under New York law so our complaint was filed with the court shortly after midnight,\u201d she added.</p> <p class=\"endmark\">Attorney Michael Madaio, a lawyer for Trump, said at the hearing that the new allegations are significantly different than the original defamation lawsuit and would require \u201can entirely new set\u201d of evidence gathering.</p>"},

So, even when they sign candidates, they\u2019re very worried about ghosting, that people won\u2019t show up on day one, because people have so many alternatives and are taking the best offer that they get.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Retailers expect holiday sales to be up 6% to 8%, with companies planning to hire 450,000 to 600,000 temporary workers \u2014 at the top end, that would be a dip from last year, and if retailers meet the bottom end of their hiring targets, it would be the lowest number of temporary hires since 2009, <a href=\"https://nrf.com/media-center/press-releases/nrf-predicts-healthy-holiday-sales-consumers-navigate-economic\" target=\"_blank\">according</a> to the National Retail Federation. </p> <p class=\"\">The holiday hiring comes at a time when retailers were already employing the highest number of workers since 2016 and the number of transportation and warehouse workers are at record highs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Before the holiday hiring rush, retailers were already looking to fill 800,000 open positions, according to the retail federation.</p> <p class=\"\">But at the same time, that tight labor market has provided a benefit to retailers heading into the holiday season because it has driven up wages \u2014 giving consumers more money to spend even in a time of massive inflation.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThe labor market is a real conundrum for employers and is one of the reasons consumers have behaved in such a resilient way because wages are increasing and there\u2019s pressure on the market, and that keeps people spending,\u201d Matt Shay, president of the retail federation, said in a call with reporters earlier this month.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">There are some signs though that the labor market is starting to shift in employers' favor. Job seekers are looking for seasonal work at the highest rates since 2019 ,with searches up just over 16% from last year, according to data from Indeed. Meanwhile, seasonal job postings are 2% lower than last year, according to the hiring website.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cWe see fewer job postings than we saw last year and more people looking in that smaller pool of postings, and the result of that is workers might have a little less bargaining power than they had in the seasonal market last year,\u201d said Cory Stahle, a senior economist at Indeed. \u201cBut we still are in this really tight labor market where even though things have cooled off a little bit, the labor market still remains really tight.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">For UPS, which is hiring 100,000 seasonal workers again this holiday season, it remains a war for candidates.\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">The company has streamlined its hiring process, cutting out in-person interviews, so that within 25 minutes it is able to process an application, give a job offer and complete the required payroll paperwork for the vast majority of its openings, including warehouse workers, package handlers and drivers.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cSomeone isn\u2019t applying to one job, they\u2019re applying to 10 jobs, and the company that best meets that candidate\u2019s needs is going to end up winning that candidate,\u201d said Matt Lavery, UPS global director of sourcing, hiring and onboarding. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to increase our odds with every candidate by being as transparent, being direct and also paying a very good wage.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">The company is on track to meet its hiring goal, but some regions remain particularly difficult to find workers, such as Minneapolis, parts of New England like Cape Cod, Denver and the surrounding mountain communities.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s hard to give a national view that\u2019s one view of the whole country. It\u2019s really different stories within the country that you have to pay attention to and be very nimble and very agile to adjust to,\u201d Lavery said. \u201cCertain pockets may be a little better than last year, and in some areas it\u2019s become extremely tough.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Macy\u2019s Inc. has also been speeding up its hiring process with applications taking as little as five minutes and the majority of applicants getting an offer\u00a0within 48 hours. The retailer will be adding 41,000 holiday workers at its Macy\u2019s, Bloomingdale\u2019s and Bluemercury stores starting at $15 an hour and is offering up to $500 in referral bonuses. </p> <p class=\"\">\"This speed is imperative during holiday hiring,\" John Patterson, Macy\u2019s vice president of talent, said in an email. \"While our application process is quick, we\u2019re asking questions that matter. Last year, this enhanced, centralized hiring process allowed us to hire fewer colleagues of higher talent levels with more competitive pay who stayed on, resulting in a 40% reduction in turnover.\"</p> <p class=\"\">Despite Amazon <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/15/amazon-starts-cutting-jobs-in-alexa-unit-and-cloud-gaming-division.html\" target=\"_blank\">cutting</a> as many as 10,000 headquarter jobs, it said last month that it is planning to add \u00a0<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/06/amazon-plans-to-hire-150000-workers-for-the-holidays.html\" target=\"_blank\">150,000 seasonal workers</a> with an average starting pay for warehouse and delivery workers of $19 an hour and sign-on bonuses ranging from $1,000 to $3,000.</p> <p class=\"\">The U.S. Postal Service will hire just half the number of people this year as last year, but officials say it is in a better staffing position going into the holidays than last year and has increased its automated processes to meet the rising demand. Postal officials assured members of Congress during a hearing earlier this month that they will have the staffing needed this holiday season and be able to avoid a scenario such as the one in 2020 when the agency  struggled to deliver packages by Christmas.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"endmark\">\u201cWe never have enough people, I\u2019ve been here 25 years, but we manage. We move people around, people work overtime, people do extraordinary things,\u201d Edmund Carley, national president of the United Postmasters and Managers of America, said during the hearing. \u201cWe\u2019ve hired in the last couple of years over 400,000 people and we continue to hire, so I don\u2019t think that I\u2019m ever fully staffed. We\u2019re always working, but we will deliver. It will be a successful season, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p>"},

Guess what election is next? Quite frankly, I think they\u2019re doing the right thing.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">The White House is cranking up its donor courtship, a strategy that\u2019s most evident in a shower of social invitations for big-dollar supporters: this week\u2019s state dinner for French President Emmanuel Macron, the arrival and lighting of the national Christmas tree, Biden\u2019s Christmas parties and Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 Hanukkah celebration among them. They\u2019re offering more policy briefings to longtime supporters, Zoom calls with top administration officials and White House tours, too.</p> <p class=\"\">The donors have taken notice and already are praising the change from a team they long complained was unavailable to answer questions in darker political moments for Biden, according to interviews with more than 20 people<strong> </strong>who have contributed to Biden, raised money for him or helped secure White House invitations for his supporters.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">An expanded social calendar means \u201cthey are getting down the list a little further,\u201d in terms of who gets face time with the president, said one White House official. And that could pay dividends for Biden if he runs in 2024.</p> <p class=\"\">Donor maintenance is a critical step for the administration should Biden seek re-election and even beyond, when he will likely want to raise hundreds of millions of dollars for a presidential library. </p> <p class=\"\">Despite all of the Biden administration\u2019s victories and the absence of a midterm shellacking, the president\u2019s poll numbers remain underwater, with an NBC poll taken just before the Nov. 8 election <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23272032-220806-nbc-november-poll-v2\" target=\"_blank\">showing him at 44%</a>. </p> <p class=\"\">Perhaps a more ominous sign, however, is that two-thirds of midterm voters <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/video/exit-poll-shows-biden-2024-run-unpopular-152971845874\">surveyed in an NBC exit poll </a>said they did not want Biden to run for re-election.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cAll of a sudden,\u201d said Alan Patricof, a longtime Democratic fundraiser, \u201cthings start changing when we get close to the next election.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">On Thursday, when Macron arrives at the White House for his official state visit, Biden campaign supporters and fundraisers will be among a large crowd invited to watch the ceremony on the White House lawn. It is the first state dinner Biden has hosted since entering office in 2021. It will honor Macron and celebrate the United States\u2019 long-standing ties with France. State dinners have been a hallmark of the U.S. presidency dating back to 1874, but Covid had curbed the administration\u2019s ability to host such events until now.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cFor one of the first times in this administration, the president\u2019s supporters \u2014 some at least \u2014 will be invited,\u201d according to a person familiar with the White House\u2019s view of the matter. \u201cAnd that, in essence, is a return to a degree of normal that you see in any administration.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">People close to the White House concede that Biden\u2019s political operation has left longtime Democratic fundraisers feeling marginalized and unappreciated. They point to the pandemic as the main reason Biden has shunned the outreach that donors see as a reward for past labors and an incentive to reel in more campaign money ahead of the 2024 election.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">The source with knowledge of the White House thinking, granted anonymity to speak freely, noted the pandemic had \u201cproved incredibly challenging as it relates to gathering indoors in these extraordinary spaces. Now that we\u2019re safely testing, we\u2019re able to do it again. I do believe that there has been a much greater number of events where we\u2019re able to bring people together again. That\u2019s always been the vision of the first lady and the president. It\u2019s just a matter of the right timing.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Among those invited to the state dinner on Macron\u2019s behalf Thursday night is Christopher Korge, chairman of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s finance committee, people familiar with the planning said.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThis is the hottest ticket in town; everyone wants to go,\u201d the person familiar with the White House\u2019s view of its donor outreach said.</p> <p class=\"\">In the past, White Houses have rewarded donors with big-ticket perks, some of which have engendered controversies, like overnight stays in the Lincoln Bedroom during Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Yet some donors also make the point that Biden has never been as attentive to the buck-raking class as Clinton, the gold standard of the modern presidency.</p> <p class=\"\">Biden is \u201cless concerned, less interested, less involved,\u201d than Clinton or former President Barack Obama, Patricof said. \u201cI\u2019ve not been to the White House since he\u2019s been elected. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m sitting here waiting. But there seems to be much less interaction with the donor community than I\u2019ve seen in the past.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">This year, Biden donors are enthralled with something far more simple: The White House throwing open its doors for the holiday season with parties and tours scheduled throughout December. And some who talked to NBC News recognized their worth isn't what it once was, noting that Biden managed to haul in big bucks online from small donors.</p> <p class=\"\">\"The $500,000 people like me, we\u2019re not going to be players in 2024,\" said Dick Harpootlian, a longtime Democratic donor and South Carolina state senator.</p> <p class=\"\">For the White House, the shift is an acceleration of a courtship campaign that began more modestly before the midterm elections. As Biden racked up a handful of major legislative victories this year \u2014 including laws aimed at combating climate change and China\u2019s edge in semiconductor manufacturing \u2014 the White House invited a broad array of supporters to celebrate at bill-signing ceremonies. Invites also went out to a White House Elton John concert.</p> <p class=\"\">Biden\u2019s defenders have long said the White House was closed to many of the president\u2019s allies because he took office during a period of much greater sensitivity to the Covid-19 pandemic. Amid concerns about the omicron variant last year, the White House was forced to abandon plans for a more full set of holiday parties. But there\u2019s no such limitation this year.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThey are inviting just an obscene number of people\u201d to December events, one Democratic official said.</p> <p class=\"\">The new level of TLC is a sign of a Biden team that\u2019s gearing up for a potential re-elect campaign and<strong> </strong>comes after top fundraisers urged Biden\u2019s aides to shift tactics. </p> <p class=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m encouraging them to court more large donors,\u201d one of them said over the summer. Part of their argument has been that the president will need donors in 2024 far more than was needed in 2020 during a pandemic and when Democrats were eagerly opening their wallets to oust Donald Trump from the Oval Office.</p> <p class=\"\">Biden\u2019s engagement with donors is important for another reason, top fundraisers have told his aides: Donors question whether he\u2019s capable of running again, leaving them hesitant to continue cutting checks. One major Democratic fundraiser said donors regularly ask of the president, \u201cIs he really with it?\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Donors who talked to NBC News said they\u2019ve noticed a change with how they\u2019re treated, including making a more conscious effort to set up phone calls with supporters, more regular briefings and even photo lines during visits like Obama made in pivotal states during the midterms. The amped-up effort involves both the White House and a Democratic National Committee that functions as the political arm of Biden\u2019s operation.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThe DNC\u2019s been virtually dormant for two years,\u201d one member of the committee said. \u201cThey\u2019re ramping up their game.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Different donors have had different expectations. Tim Lim, a Democratic strategist and Biden bundler, was among those who grew frustrated over the White House's attention to donors, bringing his complaint to the Democratic National Committee.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s childish, frankly. I even admit that now,\u201d Lim said. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to do it. But when you\u2019re trying to get an Easter Egg Roll ticket for your family, you kind of get desperate.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">The White House\u2019s shift in paying closer attention to supporters was an obvious one, he said, citing invites to a garden tour, the unveiling of Obama\u2019s White House portrait, White House trick-or-treating as well as holiday parties.</p> <p class=\"\">Another donor, who in the past complained of not having enough access, cited a recent Zoom call with White House senior adviser Steve Ricchetti and deputy chief of staff Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon that was directed at some of Biden\u2019s earliest supporters. Some of those same people were invited to the White House next month for an in-person policy briefing.</p> <p class=\"\">Some donors, however, think the White House took too long to step up its game.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cGetting up to speed has taken longer than it should,\u201d said Susie Tompkins Buell, a longtime high-dollar Democratic donor. She said supporters recognized the administration was consumed by \u201cexcessive workloads and traumas\u201d early on.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cI think donors understand but communication absolutely needs more effective attention,\u201d Buell added. She said she\u2019s seeing more examples of the White House recognizing it needs to appreciate donors but that it \u201cseems like it was not a natural instinct.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">A running question throughout this administration has been whether Biden, who turned 80 years old last week, will mount one more campaign or step aside. </p> <p class=\"\">Kessler said he spoke to Biden in late October at a Pennsylvania Democratic Party event and thanked him for having recently affirmed <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/joe-biden/biden-warns-republicans-will-tear-accomplishments-win-midterms-rcna53409\">it\u2019s his intention to run again</a>.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cI know you get tired of hearing, \u2018Is he really running?\u2019\u201d Kessler recalled telling the president. \u201cBut when you come out with strong statements like that, it\u2019s very helpful to people like me who are asked all the time.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">And how did Biden respond?</p> <p class=\"endmark\">\u201cHe liked it,\u201d Kessler said.</p>"},

{"title": "GOP to conduct post-election audit after disappointing midterms", "content": "<p class=\"\">NEW YORK \u2014 A decade after its last election autopsy, the Republican National Committee is moving forward with a new post-election audit designed to examine the GOP\u2019s underwhelming performance in the <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/midterm-elections-2022\" target=\"_blank\">recent midterms</a> and the party\u2019s broader struggles in the years since former President\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump\" target=\"_blank\">Donald Trump</a>\u00a0took power.</p> <p class=\"\">The report, which will likely take several months to complete, is expected to explore internal concerns about candidate quality, the lack of a clear governing agenda and the party\u2019s unwillingness to embrace early voting, among other issues. There is some disagreement about the exact focus and scope of the upcoming review, but committee members involved in the planning suggest it will not shy away from difficult topics \u2014 including Trump\u2019s intense focus on conspiracy theories.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cWe need to figure out what worked and what didn\u2019t work in the \u201922 cycle to make sure we put ourselves in the best position to win in \u201924. I think there\u2019s a lot to learn from,\u201d said RNC committeeman Henry Barbour, of Mississippi, whom RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel tapped to co-chair the review.</p> <p class=\"\">The decision to entertain such an undertaking represents a rare moment of public introspection from a Republican Party that has defiantly resisted any and all calls to change course during the Trump era. Indeed, for the last six years, the GOP has been almost singularly focused on its devotion to Trump and his priorities, even as electoral losses mounted in 2018 and 2020. The party\u2019s disappointing\u00a0midterm results\u00a0earlier in the month marked a breaking point of sorts for some committee members, who are now more open to change.</p> <p class=\"\">Ten years have passed since the RNC last commissioned a post-election audit. The \u201cGrowth and Opportunity Project\u201d of 2013 ultimately called on Republicans to adopt a more inclusive and welcoming tone, while embracing a more forgiving position on immigration.</p> <p class=\"\">Trump embodied everything the report advocated against when he emerged in 2015. Yet his surprising White House victory convinced party leaders to ignore their own recommendations \u2014 at least for a time.</p> <p class=\"\">McDaniel is initiating the post-2022 review as she faces a serious reelection test of her own within the committee, which she has led since Trump took office in 2016. In a corresponding move designed to demonstrate her political strength, McDaniel on Tuesday also announced the creation of an informal advisory council made up of a collection of 2022 candidates \u2014 some successful and some not \u2014 and prominent Republican operatives, including former Trump counselor <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/kellyanne-conway-appears-jan-6-committee-rcna58963\" target=\"_blank\">Kellyanne Conway</a>.</p> <p class=\"\">The advisory council is not expected to have any bearing on the review, which follows pressure on McDaniel to acknowledge a problem within her party. Some RNC members were particularly concerned after she offered a rosy assessment of the GOP\u2019s performance during a conference call the day after the midterms.</p> <p class=\"\">Republicans won a narrow House majority, falling far short of expectations, and failed to win the Senate majority. That\u2019s even as Democrats faced historically bad political headwinds.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cI must say that your remarks on the call this afternoon were disappointing and showed incredible unwillingness to face the reality of what happened last evening. I\u2019ve heard from many members today who feel the same and want a real, honest assessment of what happened,\u201d RNC member Bill Palatucci, of New Jersey, wrote in a private email to McDaniel obtained by The Associated Press.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cWe have to face the fact that most of our candidates and the party in general underperformed by any objective measure,\u201d Palatucci continued. \u201cI wish you well but being unwilling to address the reality of the situation does no one any good.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Trump\u2019s allies are expected to play an active role in the upcoming review.</p> <p class=\"\">McDaniel has tapped Harmeet Dhillon, a Trump attorney and committeewoman from California, to serve as the other co-chair. Former Trump campaign manager David Bossie, an RNC member from Maryland, is also likely to be involved.</p> <p class=\"\">Trump loyalists have played an increasingly large role within the RNC, which consists of elected officials from all 50 states and a central staff in Washington. Those openly critical of Trump have largely been forced out in recent years.</p> <p class=\"\">Now, McDaniel is tasked with maintaining unity within her party as a growing number of GOP leaders push back against Trump\u2019s influence.</p> <p class=\"\">Several Republican presidential prospects are openly preparing to challenge Trump\u2019s bid for the 2024 presidential nomination. In recent days, some of them, including former Vice President Mike Pence, have condemned Trump\u2019s recent private meeting with white supremacist and antisemite Nick Fuentes.</p> <p class=\"\">Despite an apparent shift in the party, those working on the new review are acutely aware that their final report cannot alienate Trump or his base, viewed as a critical piece of the Republican coalition.</p> <p class=\"\">It is a delicate balance, especially as Democrats work to avoid such divisions of their own heading into the next presidential election.</p> <p class=\"endmark\">\u201cDemocrats are unified \u2014 on how to divide America,\u201d said Conway, the former Trump counselor. \u201cRepublicans must be unified \u2014 on how best to help a broken nation.\u201d</p>"},

{"title": "Biden leans into manufacturing in campaign-style Michigan speech", "content": "<p class=\"\">BAY CITY, Mich. \u2014 An exultant <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house\" target=\"_blank\">Joe Biden</a> sounded every bit like a president hungering for another term, imploring Americans in a speech Tuesday to buy into his vision of a nation making dramatic <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy\" target=\"_blank\">economic strides</a> against global competition.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cWe\u2019re building a better America,\u201d Biden said at a plant that makes components for electric vehicles. \u201cWe just have to keep it going! I know we can.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Biden vowed in his half-hour remarks that the U.S. would expand its manufacturing capacity to levels preventing the sorts of supply-side disruptions that led to shortages of vital products early on during the <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/health/coronavirus\" target=\"_blank\">Covid pandemic</a>. He suggested that China and Europe aren\u2019t necessarily happy about America\u2019s economic ambitions, but he indicated he\u2019s determined to supplant their role as vital links in the worldwide supply chain.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cWe\u2019ve proven it\u2019s never, ever been a good bet to bet against America,\u201d Biden said at SK Siltron CSS\u2019 gleaming new plant before an appreciative crowd of union workers, elected officials and political supporters. \u201cI mean it.\u201d\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Biden was speaking about the nation, but he might just as well have been talking about himself. Two years ago, anyone betting against Biden\u2019s political prospects would have lost. He upended conventional thinking when he rallied after early defeats in the 2020 Democratic primaries and then went on to win the nomination and oust President Donald Trump. Just this month, Biden\u2019s party defied history in the midterm elections by keeping control of the Senate and staving off heavy losses in the House.</p> <p class=\"\">Still, Biden has been guarded about his own political future, saying he intends to run for re-election in 2024 while stopping short of a definitive announcement.</p> <p class=\"\">Rep. Dan Kildee, a Democrat who represents the district that\u2019s home to the SK Siltron CSS plant and preceded Biden onstage, said in an interview Tuesday that he doesn\u2019t know Biden\u2019s plans for the next election. Asked whether he wants Biden to run, Kildee said: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be up to him.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cIf he decides to run, obviously we\u2019ll support him,\u201d he added. \u201cThese are personal decisions before they\u2019re political ones.\u201d\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Biden was introduced by Kildee and another Democrat who figured prominently in the party\u2019s midterm success story: Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. Both Whitmer and Kildee defeated Republican challengers.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">In the interview, Kildee said Biden\u2019s focus on creating jobs is a winning message that Democrats should carry into 2024.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cI ran on the agenda that President Biden and I and others promoted \u2014 and I won in a Republican-leaning district by more than 10 points,\u201d said Kildee, whose congressional race was one of the most competitive in the country. \u201cSo I think that Michigan is well-positioned to show the rest of the country that when you lean in, have great candidates and policies that make sense, we will be rewarded for it.\u201d\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">As a backdrop for the speech, Biden chose a plant that symbolizes the kind of high-tech manufacturing jobs he wants to create. Earlier this year, SK Siltron CSS opened a facility here \u2014 about 100 miles northwest of Detroit \u2014 as part of a $300 million expansion project. The plant employs about 220 people, and the company expects the number to grow to 300 in the coming years, a spokesman said.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Biden touts his industrial policy as a reason for his optimism about U.S. economic prospects. In August, he signed into law the CHIPS and Science measure, which sets aside more than $52 billion for semiconductor manufacturing and research. As a condition, recipients of the money are barred from building \u201c<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/08/09/fact-sheet-chips-and-science-act-will-lower-costs-create-jobs-strengthen-supply-chains-and-counter-china/\">certain facilities in China and other countries of concern</a>,\u201d the White House said.</p> <p class=\"\">But the credit Biden has given himself may be overstated. U.S. employment in the manufacturing sector has been<a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MANEMP\"> declining since the late 1970s</a>, in part because of the outsourcing of jobs to countries that pay much lower wages.</p> <p class=\"\">Biden has said <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/11/04/statement-by-president-joe-biden-on-the-october-jobs-report/\">more than 700,000 manufacturing jobs</a> have been added since he took office. A <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/article/2022/nov/01/joe-biden-and-manufacturing-jobs-closer-look/\">PolitiFact report</a>, however, says that the uptick was evident under Biden\u2019s predecessor and that, in part, it was a product of Trump administration policies.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Biden\u2019s visit Tuesday dovetailed neatly with the Democrats\u2019 political ambitions. The plant is in Bay County, which Trump won in both 2016 and 2020. Before the 2016 election, the last Republican presidential candidate to win the county was Ronald Reagan, in his landslide re-election in 1984.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Democrats would like to flip the county in 2024, when Michigan will, as ever, loom as a crucial battleground state. A step toward\u00a0making that happen is to show voters that government policies are helping create jobs, local party officials said.</p> <p class=\"endmark\">\u201cBay County was traditionally a very dependable Democratic county, and that changed when Trump came into being,\u201d said Karen Tighe, the county Democratic chairwoman. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping that President Biden\u2019s visit might entice people to come back to the fold and recognize what his administration is doing for us economically.\u201d</p>"},

It could extend the so-called cooling-off period, giving the parties more time to try to reach a voluntary agreement before workers can strike. It could also impose a labor agreement on the workers similar to the one already agreed to by labor leaders and carriers or make modifications to the agreement that could be more or less favorable to workers or their employers.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Pelosi said the House would vote this week on the legislation Biden is calling for, which wouldn\u2019t make any changes to the current agreement.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThis week, the House will take up a bill adopting the Tentative Agreement \u2014 with no poison pills or changes to the negotiated terms \u2014 and send it to the Senate,\u201d she said in a statement following Biden\u2019s.</p> <p class=\"\">House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., left the White House meeting critical of the need to pass legislation but saying he thought it would pass. </p> <p class=\"\">\u201cI think it will pass, but it\u2019s unfortunate this is how we\u2019re running our economy today,\" McCarthy said. </p> <p class=\"\">The bigger obstacle may lie with the Senate, where Democrats and Republicans will need to come together to get the 60 votes needed to avoid a filibuster.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">For Democrats, imposing a contract on workers would seem to fly in the face of the pro-union positions many have spent their careers advocating for and risk upsetting their key constituency of union members and labor leaders.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">But it could also provide an opportunity for Democrats to step in and give additional benefits to the rail workers, like paid sick days, although that would likely make it more difficult to get Republican support. </p> <p class=\"\">Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., blocked legislation in September that would have averted a potential strike at the time before a tentative agreement was reached, arguing that rail workers needed better sick leave.</p> <p class=\"\">As for Republicans, the prospect of a strike gives them an opportunity to blast Biden for his handling of the economy and fan the flames of a potential economic disruption that could hurt Democrats in the next election. It could also give them an opening to weaken the contract brokered with labor leaders, making it more favorable to the industry.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Sen.

The audit, started after the 2020 election, includes two Republican counties and one Democratic county. Conservative groups began pushing for audits of election returns in various states in 2020 after former President Donald Trump falsely claimed that the election had been stolen from him. Those claims are considered to have played a part in the <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/jan-6-committee-turns-trumps-election-lies-loses-key-witness-rcna32988\" target=\"_blank\">Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol</a>. </p> <p class=\"\">Also, Harris County\u2019s district attorney, a Democrat who <a href=\"https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/politics/2022/05/17/425201/lina-hidalgo-accuses-da-kim-ogg-of-election-year-politics-in-covid-outreach-contract-investigation/\" target=\"_blank\">has clashed </a>with county Judge Lina Hidalgo, also a Democrat, is calling for Texas Rangers to investigate after the Republican secretary of state informed her of \u201calleged irregularities\u201d regarding voting, which the office said could include criminal conduct.</p> <p class=\"\">Texas Democratic Party leaders and the Harris County Democratic Party chair criticized Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg\u2019s planned investigation, calling on her to \u201cstop enabling Texas Republicans' insidious efforts to silence Black and Brown Houstonians.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cIn 2021, Texas Republicans moved mountains to make it harder for Black and Brown residents of Harris County to vote. It appears that in 2022, after Democrats made significant holds and gains in Harris, Republicans are doubling down on their voter suppression efforts,\u201d the Democrats said in a statement late Thursday.</p> <p class=\"\">Ogg said in a statement her office is statutorily required to investigate election irregularities and such investigations are done regardless of party affiliation.\u00a0Findings from the\u00a0Texas\u00a0Rangers investigation will be turned over to a grand jury, she stated. She noted previous investigations after the 2020 elections, which led to <a href=\"https://www.click2houston.com/news/politics/2020/12/11/former-candidate-charged-with-election-fraud-in-case-of-ghost-candidate-on-primary-ballot/\" target=\"_blank\">indictments</a> of three Democrats and two Republicans. </p> <p class=\"\">It has not gone unnoticed that Democrat-voting Harris County is the target of the state's urgent response.

But the recent wave of street protests in Iran has injected a particularly heavy dose of politics, especially after the U.S. Soccer Federation tweeted an altered Iranian flag, one without the emblem of the Islamic Republic, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/us-soccer-briefly-scrubs-emblem-iran-flag-world-cup-rcna58869\">to show solidarity</a> with Iranian women demonstrating against the government.</p> <p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/world-cup-us-vs-iran-live-updates-rcna59096#rcrd8091\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>Follow along for live coverage of Tuesday's World Cup</em></strong></a></p> <p class=\"\">Iran responded by demanding that the U.S. be expelled from the quadrennial tournament, arguing that the social media posts, which also showed up on Facebook and Instagram, violated the rules and regulations of FIFA, the sport\u2019s governing body.</p> <p class=\"\">The U.S. federation later said that the posts were intentional but that they would now display the Iranian flag in full. The State Department said it had not coordinated in any way with the soccer federation, and the U.S. team said it was not informed of the symbolic gesture beforehand.</p> <p class=\"\">Beyond the political firestorm, the game itself comes with high stakes, as the young U.S. team needs a win to advance to the next stage of the tournament. But at a news conference on the eve of the match, coach Gregg Berhalter and team captain Tyler Adams faced one political question after another from Iranian journalists.</p> <p class=\"\">Asked about his views on U.S. restrictions on visas for Iranian citizens, Berhalter said:\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know enough about politics. I\u2019m a soccer coach.\u201d He also was asked for his thoughts about the U.S. military\u2019s presence in the Persian Gulf.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Meanwhile, an Iranian reporter lectured Adams about his pronunciation of the country\u2019s name, saying it was not \u201cI-RAN\u201d but \u201cEE-RON.\u201d\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cFirst of all, you say you support the Iranian people, but you\u2019re pronouncing our country\u2019s name wrong,\u201d the reporter said. Then he asked Adams about how he felt about playing for a country \u201cthat has so much discrimination against Black people in its own borders.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Adams, whose biological father is African American, apologized for his pronunciation of Iran and answered the question about race relations.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cYou know, one thing that I\u2019ve learned, especially from living abroad in the past years and having to fit in in different cultures and kind of assimilate into different cultures, is that in the U.S., we\u2019re continuing to make progress every single day,\u201d said Adams, who plays for Leeds United in England\u2019s Premier League. He added: \u201cI think as long as you see progress, that\u2019s the most important thing.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">When Iran\u2019s coach, Carlos Queiroz, spoke to reporters, he also tried to steer the discussion away from politics.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cI understand your questions and the stories that you, as professionals, you need to bring,\u201d Queiroz said. But he added: \u201cLet\u2019s enjoy that party. Let\u2019s enjoy the show.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">The street protests in Iran began in September, when a 22-year-old woman from the country\u2019s Kurdish region died in the hospital three days after she was arrested and accused of violating the country\u2019s strict dress code.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">The protests at home have followed Iran\u2019s soccer team throughout the World Cup, which began Nov. 20 in Qatar. At some of the games, Qatari police have confiscated T-shirts or signs supporting the protests in Iran.</p> <p class=\"\">Team captain Ehsan Hajsafi expressed empathy for protesting Iranians at a news conference.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cWe have to accept that the situation in our country is not good and that our people are not happy, they are discontent,\u201d Hajsafi said. \u201cWe are here, but it does not mean we should not be their voice or that we should not respect them. Whatever we have is theirs.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Last week, Iran\u2019s players <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/iran-soccer-team-silent-national-anthem-world-cup-game-rcna58121\">refused to sing the country\u2019s national anthem</a> before their opening match against England in an apparent act of defiance against their government.</p> <p class=\"\">More recently, a prominent former soccer player in Iran, Voria Ghafouri, was arrested after he endorsed the protests, according to Iranian state-linked media.\u00a0He was later released on bail, Iranian and other media reported.</p> <p class=\"\">Apart from politics, J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann, the former German soccer star who was the U.S. men\u2019s coach in the 2014 World Cup, infuriated Iran with a comment last week about its soccer \u201cculture,\u201d suggesting Iranian players use tricks to sway referees.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThis is just part of their culture. That\u2019s how they play. They work the referee. You saw the bench always jumping up, always working the linesman, constantly in their ears. They\u2019re constantly in your face,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/63772068\" target=\"_blank\">Klinsmann, a BBC commentator, said</a> after Iran defeated Wales 2-0 on Friday.</p> <p class=\"\">The U.S. men\u2019s team last faced Iran in a World Cup in 1998, and the Americans lost 2-1 in a bitter defeat that saw jubilant Iranian fans pour into the streets \u2014 in stark contrast to the mood in Iran ahead of the current match, which has been dampened by the protests and the regime\u2019s violent crackdown. Iranians have burned posters promoting the national team even as its members have signaled support for the protesters, and there were no big crowds after Iran\u2019s victory over Wales in their last match.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Berhalter played for the U.S. team in the last game, which was also upstaged by political tensions between the two countries. The coach at the time, Steve Sampson, said last week it was difficult to concentrate on the game at hand because of the politics swirling around it.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cIt was a challenge to keep the players focused,\u201d <a href=\"https://blog.siriusxm.com/steve-sampson-1998-world-cup/\">Sampson said</a>.</p> <p class=\"\">In a departure from protocol, the two teams posed for a photo together before the game, and the Iranian side handed over white roses in a gesture of peace.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">But in retrospect, Sampson said, he wished he had not agreed to the photo session.</p> <p class=\"endmark\">\u201cI\u2019ve reflected on this for years,\u201d Sampson said. \u201cIf I had to do it all over again, I would not have allowed the exchange of roses or the joint picture.\u201d</p>"},

{"title": "2024 GOP presidential hopefuls in no rush to jump in against Trump", "content": "<p class=\"\">President Donald Trump is boxing his own shadow as he seeks the Republican presidential nomination \u2014 and that\u2019s not likely to change anytime soon.</p> <p class=\"\">There\u2019s little incentive for rivals to join him in the ring, according to advisers to potential candidates and other Republican strategists.</p> <p class=\"\">From the front row, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is collecting support from<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/11/06/gop-megadonor-desantis-24-ken-griffin-00065274\"> prominent donors</a> and<a href=\"https://www.fox4news.com/news/poll-desantis-trump-texas\"> beating Trump</a> in some polls of<a href=\"https://www.clubforgrowth.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/CfGAction_2024_Primary_PollSummary_221114.pdf\"> key states</a>. If he runs, that announcement isn\u2019t expected to come until summer at the earliest \u2014 probably after Florida\u2019s legislative session ends in June \u2014 which will give him time to gauge his own chances.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cHe\u2019s not in a hurry because he doesn\u2019t have to be. And he has a day job: governor,\u201d said one top Florida Republican who was in regular contact with DeSantis throughout his 2022 re-election campaign and spoke anonymously to relay how he believes DeSantis is thinking.</p> <p class=\"\">Dan Eberhart, a Republican fundraiser who once backed Trump but now wants DeSantis to be the party\u2019s nominee in 2024, said there's time.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cIf Trump is going to be in, I would like for him not to be the only national Republican candidate out there,\u201d Eberhart said. \u201cBut DeSantis isn\u2019t going to get in until after the Florida legislative session ends, at least. Anyone that gets in now runs the risk of peaking too early.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">The two-part early conclusion drawn by many GOP insiders is that the only way to beat Trump is by unifying around a single alternative and that DeSantis is the best of the rest.</p> <p class=\"\">That\u2019s why the timing calculations are a bit more complicated for the lower-polling candidates, who also have to worry that the race quickly becomes a clash of titans between Trump and DeSantis with little available space for also-rans. The questions of whether and when to jump in are inexorably linked, as windows of opportunity can open and close at a moment\u2019s notice.</p> <p class=\"\">Trump\u2019s early announcement for president \u2014 which he almost made before the midterm elections last week \u2014 followed nearly two years of planning, fundraising and speeches. His interest in announcing a presidential bid intensified last year when President Joe Biden\u2019s approval ratings dropped amid the souring economy and chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Aides say his desire to run became even more earnest as he increasingly saw DeSantis as a threat and, then, as the Department of Justice opened two separate criminal investigations into him over his role in the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol and his possession and storage of sensitive documents that the federal government says he improperly handled in his post-presidency.</p> <p class=\"\">But others aren\u2019t feeling Trump\u2019s urgency.</p> <p class=\"\">Since Trump\u2019s Tuesday speech, there have been more signs of movement in the invisible primary \u2014 the behind-the-scenes battle to line up donors, endorsers and top staff \u2014 than a rush to launch.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cPeople are either waiting or scrambling to get as close to DeSantis\u2019 inner circle as possible \u2014 or they\u2019re with Trump,\u201d Eberhart said of the donor class.</p> <p class=\"\">In the world of GOP elites, the field is quickly narrowing to Trump and DeSantis, and the Florida Republican source said there is something unique about their rivalry.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThe fact is Ron is different from any other Republican who might run against Trump,\u201d the Republican said. \u201cRon is in Trump\u2019s head. The other guys aren\u2019t. Ron made a red wave in the state when it didn\u2019t materialize really anywhere else. He won by a historic margin. And billionaires are basically begging him to run.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">In addition to the celebrity from his big re-election win of nearly 20 points, DeSantis has an edge over some of the other possible non-Trump candidates: money. His political and campaign committees had at least $64 million in the bank, according to the most recent campaign finance data.</p> <p class=\"\">DeSantis continued to fundraise after the election but has no immediately known plans to convert the state political committee into a federal super PAC that could support his federal candidacy.</p> <p class=\"\">Florida also has a so-called resign to run law that would require DeSantis, if he qualifies to run for president, to resign as governor after the 2024 election \u2014 whether or not he wins the presidency. Legislative allies are expected to change the law during the spring lawmaking session but they\u2019re \u201cwaiting on smoke signals from the Plaza Level,\u201d said a knowledgeable legislative source referring to the Tallahassee shorthand for the location of the governor\u2019s office on the first floor of the state Capitol.</p> <p class=\"\">One reason for the other hopefuls to wait outside the ring is the hope that Trump and DeSantis bloody each other badly enough to turn the title fight into a battle royal.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Former Vice President Mike Pence, who needs no introduction to voters, is on a book tour. In fact, his book came out on the same day as Trump\u2019s big announcement. He didn\u2019t watch Trump\u2019s launch speech Tuesday, according to an aide, and has said he could wait until the spring to announce whether he will run.</p> <p class=\"\">Like DeSantis, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin is expected to keep his focus on state matters, possibly until Virginia\u2019s legislative session ends in February.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">But Youngkin maintained a robust schedule on behalf of Republican candidates in the midterms, earning chits in key states, and he has a growing list of prominent GOP donors ready to back him should he join the race.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Trump appears to have noticed, targeting the governor with <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/donald-trump-blasts-out-racist-attack-on-virginia-gov-glenn-youngkin\">a racist, somewhat confusing, attack</a> on his social media platform.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, long viewed as having eyes on the presidency, made critical remarks of Trump on Wednesday in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/16/us/politics/trump-republicans-alternatives.html\" target=\"_blank\">The New York Times</a>. But in a <a href=\"https://rumble.com/v1v70qu-sd-governor-kristi-noem-republicans-must-embrace-the-ideals-and-history-tha.html\" target=\"_blank\">\"War Room\" podcast</a> interview on Thursday with former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, she walked back the remarks and issued a mild criticism of DeSantis for briefly locking down Florida during spring break when the Covid pandemic first hit in 2020.</p> <p class=\"\">The better known a potential candidate is, the longer he or she can afford to wait. It takes more time and money for more obscure hopefuls to become familiar to voters. The GOP primary electorate is familiar with Trump and Pence from their time in the White House, and, to a lesser extent, DeSantis and even Youngkin a bit from their recent high-profile gubernatorial wins.</p> <p class=\"\">The Pence aide says there\u2019s no concern in his camp that anti-Trump donors will all flock to DeSantis.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cI think that the donor base is so large that that is not a threat; I don\u2019t think there could be that level of consolidation,\u201d the Pence aide said, pointing to loyalty among the former vice president\u2019s contributors that transcends pure political calculation. \u201cThere are elements of the donor base that I think he appeals to because of his faith and his devotion in that faith that other candidates don\u2019t really appeal to.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">But would-be candidates who haven\u2019t been in the political arena as recently \u2014 former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie among them \u2014 may have to make their decisions a little more quickly. Few are tipping their hands now.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThe secretary hasn\u2019t made a final decision about whether or not he will run,\u201d a person close to Pompeo said. \u201cBut that decision will be based on if he thinks it is the best place for him to serve and if the timing is correct.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Christie is <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2022/11/15/chris-christie-trump-governors\">clearly eager to hammer Trump</a>, but it\u2019s not clear whether that will be as a candidate or perhaps as a commentator on television. He is \u201copen to\u201d a run, said longtime adviser Mike DuHaime, who added that Christie will not jump in \u201cunless he sees a path\u201d to the nomination. Either way, DuHaime said, Trump\u2019s entry has no effect on Christie\u2019s thinking and no decision is imminent.</p> <p class=\"\">Trump\u2019s team has long held the position that he\u2019s expecting other Republicans to run against him and that, if a critical number of primary challengers line up, it would make his candidacy even more formidable.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cWe have at least 30% of the Republican primary electorate that will do anything to support the [former] president. And the value of their votes becomes proportionately higher if a bunch of others pile in the race and dilute the not-Trump vote and divide it up between them,\u201d said one Trump strategist who spoke anonymously to share the campaign\u2019s thinking.</p> <p class=\"\">In the days since Trump\u2019s launch, his campaign has released a string of endorsements from lawmakers. But the number is much lower than the set that he endorsed in the recent midterm elections, and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., dodged this week when he was asked whether he backs Trump for president.</p> <p class=\"\">Steven Cheung, the communications director for Trump\u2019s campaign, said that the former president believes \u201cAmerica is in decline due to the weak leadership of Joe Biden,\u201d adding that \u201cthere are others who will be bound to the political establishment, be beholden to corporations and drag the United States into more unnecessary wars.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Brad Todd, a veteran Republican strategist, said it makes more sense for hopefuls to take their time for a variety of logistical reasons, including federal fundraising limits that are imposed once a candidacy becomes official. But more than that, he said, Republican voters are exhausted.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cCampaigns have gotten bigger and rougher and louder, and I think voters reach a capacity when they need a break,\u201d Todd said. \u201cMy advice for anyone running for anything in 2024 right now would be let the voters have their holiday.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">One GOP strategist who worked for Trump in the past said that DeSantis would be smart to stay out and let the former president see how much his own support has dissipated even without a big rival in the race.</p> <p class=\"endmark\">\u201cIf he\u2019s not in, it will just drive Trump crazy,\u201d the strategist said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have all these donors, all these folks waiting for DeSantis and that\u2019s going to be their answer [when Trump asks for help]. And that\u2019s just going to twist the knife.\u201d\u00a0</p>"},

If the party continues to be following the Trump model and is Trumpian and doesn\u2019t go back to their more conservative roots of the traditional Republican Party, I will say, definitely that\u2019ll be a problem,\u201d he said.</p> <p class=\"\">Peters entered the 2022 cycle with a daunting task: to preserve the thinnest possible majority in what is typically a losing year for a party in control of the White House and Congress, a task made even more daunting this year by a president underwater in his approval rating and widespread economic pain throughout the country.</p> <p class=\"\">Democrats defied gravity, clinching 50 Senate seats and losing no incumbents. They can make it 51 in the <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/gop-starts-boosting-walkers-runoff-calls-keep-trump-away-georgia-rcna56514\" target=\"_blank\">Dec. 6 Georgia runoff</a> if Democratic Sen.

He ignored projections that the fundamentals of the midterms would swamp Democratic senators in states like Nevada, Arizona and New Hampshire. \u201cOur numbers were actually pretty consistent,\u201d he said. \u201cWe knew we were going in a tough environment.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Apart from Trump, Peters said <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/inflation-abortion-lead-list-voter-concerns-nbc-news-exit-poll-finds-rcna56258\" target=\"_blank\">abortion was a motivating factor</a> for suburban voters and credited the party\u2019s \u201cunprecedented\u201d early investments in ground operations for the win, adding \u201cthe attacks on democracy\u201d from \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/election-deniers-overwhelmingly-lost-battleground-states-rcna57058\" target=\"_blank\">the election denial folks</a>\u201d had an impact. \u201cPeople do care about that in this country.

Rick Scott, R-Fla., his counterpart who runs the Republican campaign arm. While Scott began the cycle with bold predictions of a 2010-style \"red wave,\" the soft-spoken Michigan Democrat stayed out of the limelight. While Scott <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/sen-rick-scotts-agenda-seen-challenge-mcconnell-gop-rcna17435\" target=\"_blank\">broke ranks with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/mcconnell-rejects-senate-gop-election-head-rick-scotts-2022-agenda-rcna18176\" target=\"_blank\">released a controversial agenda</a> that became fodder for Democratic attack ads, Peters says he worked in lockstep with Majority Leader Chuck Schumer throughout the cycle.</p> <p class=\"\">Now, Scott and McConnell are engaged in an <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/mcconnell-re-elected-senate-gop-leader-defeating-challenge-rick-scott-rcna57487\" target=\"_blank\">ugly public clash</a> over <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/republican-infighting-escalates-poor-2022-election-results-trump-re-em-rcna57540\" target=\"_blank\">why their party failed to win the Senate</a>, with their advisers publicly questioning whether the other is doing enough to help Walker in the Georgia runoff.

{"title": "Home heating costs are on the rise but government assistance is running short", "content": "<p class=\"\">WASHINGTON \u2014 As winter temperatures arrive across America,  government officials are bracing for a surge of households unable to pay rising winter heating bills, and dwindling resources available to help cover the costs.</p> <p class=\"\">For the average household, home heating costs are <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/report/winterfuels.php#:~:text=The%20residential%20natural%20gas%20price,of%202022%20compared%20with%202021.\" target=\"_blank\">projected</a> to rise <strong> </strong>28% \u2014 on top of double-digit increases last year \u2014 driven largely by the disruption to energy markets caused by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and surging demand for fossil fuels. At the same time, federally funded programs to help low-income households with those bills will have 42% less money this winter after the billions of dollars in Covid stimulus available last winter runs out.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">The surge in demand and drop in aid is causing concern throughout state and federal governments. In anticipation, the White House has taken a three-prong approach the past year, said an administration official: It has urged oil companies to bolster their stockpiles; make funds available to weatherize homes and make them more energy efficient; and prepare for further releases from the country's petroleum or heating oil reserves. </p> <p class=\"\">But temperatures are already dropping and the number of households seeking assistance is already on the rise, according to interviews with more than a half dozen officials involved in programs that provide heating assistance. </p> <p class=\"\">\u201cWe\u2019re already seeing record numbers of requests this season for utility assistance and really the heating season is just beginning,\u201d said Scott Kelly, general secretary of the Massachusetts division of the Salvation Army, an international charitable organization. \u201cOur social workers are seeing people who have never needed to ask for help before, so it\u2019s definitely concerning to us. We are very concerned about what the future will hold this heating season.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Americans are getting squeezed financially on a number of other fronts with inflation that has shown little signs of abating, and the end to a number of pandemic-era assistance programs, such as the emergency rental assistance funding and the child tax credit that provided hundreds of dollars a month to households before it expired last year.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Kelly said the Salvation Army in Massachusetts has received twice as many applications as it did this time last year for its winter heating assistance program, which is aimed at those whose incomes are too high to qualify for federal assistance.</p> <p class=\"\">One of those seeking help this winter is Malonie Bernard. She said her family has been struggling to pay its utility bills with a single income from her fianc\u00e9 after she left her job at a nursing home during the pandemic to take care of her three children.\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">As the temperatures have dipped into the 20s at night in her hometown of Fitchburg, she has yet to turn on the gas heat in her apartment. </p> <p class=\"\">Instead, her 9- and 12-year-old children sleep under multiple blankets in heavy pajamas and some nights she uses her body heat to keep her 11-month-old baby warm. She strategically uses space heaters, is sure to use the oven instead of the stove, and times her laundry so the dryer will help warm the house in the evening.</p> <p class=\"\">Each month, Bernard says she has to juggle what bills to pay and what ones to delay as costs have kept rising. Over the summer her electric bill for her seven-room apartment shot up to $700 one month, it had previously never gone above $200, and she\u2019s run up  an unpaid balance of about $1,000. For the winter, she\u2019s anticipating her gas bill will be well above last winter\u2019s of $600 a month \u2014 money her family doesn\u2019t have in their budget.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s hard. It\u2019s so hard asking for help, but at this point, we have no choice,\u201d said Bernard. \u201cWe feel bad, as if we\u2019re taking it from someone else who really, really needs it. So we try to push it, but I said this year, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to be able to push it.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">In Colorado, the demand for assistance through the federally funded Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, know as LIHEAP, is expected to far outstrip the demand, said Theresa Kullen, who manages the program in Colorado. Kullen said she expects applications to be up 10% this winter on top of the 10% increase they saw last year.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cWe\u2019re very concerned about how much we can do because we know it\u2019s not enough, there\u2019s just not enough money to do what we need to do,\u201d said Kullen. \u201cWith the pandemic relief funds we were able to do so much good, and that money is now gone. And so we are taking a step backwards.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">But many of those who apply this year will find far less help available to them now that pandemic-era programs have run dry.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cIf Congress doesn\u2019t step in and find some way to help the bottom third of the population pay these bills you\u2019ll see more suffering and they\u2019ll just be poor instead of being working class, and that\u2019s what they\u2019re afraid of, working-class families are afraid of becoming poor,\u201d said Mark Wolfe, \u00a0executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. \u201cYou no longer have what makes you feel lower middle class, you now feel poor, and that\u2019s what\u2019s happening across the board with these inflationary increases, and it\u2019s subtle, it\u2019s quiet.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Congress has allocated $4.8 billion for heating assistance this winter through the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which is $1 billion more than pre-pandemic funding levels. But that will be far less than the $8.3 billion available last year with the addition of Covid relief funds.</p> <p class=\"\">Despite the extra assistance last year, 20 million households are already behind on their utility bills owing a total of $16 billion in overdue payments \u2014 an average of $800 per household, <a href=\"https://neada.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/20millionbehindPR.pdf\">according to NEADA</a>. That\u2019s up from $8 billion in utility bill debt at the start of the pandemic.</p> <p class=\"\">Energy costs are on the rise for a range of reasons. Prices for natural gas, the most common form of winter heating in the U.S., are projected to rise 28% this winter, largely because of increased demand in Europe following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, according to the Energy Information Administration.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">The price of heating oil, which is widely used in New England, is expected to be up 27% this winter, and it will cost the average home $1,000 more this winter for heating oil than two years ago, <a href=\"https://neada.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/20millionbehindPR.pdf\">according to NEADA</a>. Heating oil prices are linked to the price of crude oil, which has been increasing as a result of surging demand following the pandemic, limited refinery capacity and uncertainty in the markets from Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.</p> <p class=\"\">In Maine, where the majority of households rely on heating oil, officials have seen a 10% uptick in applications so far this year for its heating assistance program that provided help to 40,000 households last year. Without the Covid stimulus money this year, Maine will provide benefits to around the same number of households, but the amount they receive will be about half of last year\u2019s benefit, said Scott Thistle, a spokesman for MaineHousing.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cLast winter, we were able to provide about a tank and a half of heating benefit. This year, we\u2019re going to be able to provide them with less than a tank. Maybe if we\u2019re lucky, depending on the price of oil, we\u2019ll get two-thirds or a half a tank so it just doesn\u2019t go as far,\u201d said Thistle.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">The cost of heating oil has been a particular concern for the Biden administration, said the government official. Biden and Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm have been urging oil companies to cut exports of diesel, which is chemically the same as heating oil, to keep more in the U.S. to build up stockpiles in the Northeast in case there are supply disruptions or colder-than-expected weather that leads to a surge in demand.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Heating oil and diesel inventories are at their lowest levels on record for this time of year.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">The administration is also prepared to tap into the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve, which has about 1 million barrels of heating oil, if necessary, the administration officials said.</p> <p class=\"\">The White House announced earlier this month it was also distributing $9 billion from the Inflation Reduction Act passed earlier this year to help 1.6 million households upgrade their homes to lower energy bills, like providing rebates to purchase a new electric stove, install new insulation or energy efficient appliances. The administration is also distributing $3.16\u00a0billion from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to retrofit thousands of low-incomes homes to make them more energy efficient while lowering utility bills, including installing insulation and updating heating and cooling systems.</p> <p class=\"endmark\">Longer term, the Biden administration is looking for ways to expand heat pump use and manufacturing in the U.S. and develop programs to improve building energy efficiency, according to an announcement earlier this month. </p>"},

Brian Kemp in March 2021, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/georgia-passes-vast-restrictive-voting-law-limiting-early-voting-ballot-n1262101\" target=\"_blank\">cut in half the time</a> allowed between a general election and a runoff election \u2014 drastically shortening the period during which many voters must request, receive and cast ballots. The law's narrowed time frame also effectively cuts the early in-person voting period, from a minimum of 16 days in 2020 to a minimum of 5 in 2022, while existing rules have ensured almost no new voters will be eligible to vote in the runoff.</p> <p class=\"\">Proponents of the bill's provisions on runoffs argue that cutting the period eases a long and arduous process for everyone involved. The law's authors <a href=\"https://www.legis.ga.gov/api/legislation/document/20212022/201498\" target=\"_blank\">even wrote into the bill </a>that \"the lengthy nine-week runoffs in 2020 were exhausting for candidates, donors, and 120 electors.\" Other supporters, including Gabriel Sterling, the chief operating officer in the Office of the Georgia Secretary of State, note that before 2013, the state's runoff period was four weeks and that the elections ran without problems.</p> <p class=\"\">\"This is not the first time we've had to do this,\" Sterling said at <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?524156-1/georgia-secretary-state-brad-raffensperger-update-senate-runoff-election#\" target=\"_blank\">a news conference</a> last week. \"This is not that unique.\"</p> <p class=\"\">But voting rights advocates, both in Georgia and around the country, say the new law's changes present challenges. </p> <p class=\"\">\u201cIt was not just that the runoff date was moved up, it\u2019s that the period to get so many steps done has been condensed,\u201d said Danielle Lang, the senior director of the voting rights unit at the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan voting watchdog group.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThe big takeaway here is that the compressing of the time line for a runoff has spillover effects on access for voters,\u201d she said.</p> <p class=\"\">Here are several of the ways the new law could affect voters in the runoff.</p> <p class=\"\">Under SB 202, Georgia runoff elections now take place 28 days after the general election \u2014 less than half the original nine-week period that existed before the law. This year\u2019s runoff will take place on Dec. 6, following the Nov. 8 midterms. </p> <p class=\"\">The law, however, does not change an existing rule that voters must register at least 30 days before an election.</p> <p class=\"\">As a result, new voters who weren\u2019t registered for the general election <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/georgia-organizations-push-keep-black-voters-energized-crucial-senate-rcna57160\">will not be able to register </a>in time to vote in the runoff  because the deadline will have already passed.</p> <p class=\"\">That\u2019s a stark difference from the landscape in the state in 2020 \u2014 that year both of the state\u2019s U.S. Senate races advanced to a runoff that would determine control of the chamber \u2014 when candidates and outside groups rushed to register droves of new voters.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThe bottom line is that nobody can vote in this runoff who didn\u2019t register as of Nov. 7,\u201d said Lang. She added there\u2019s likely still a narrow new pool of voters who registered too late to vote in the general election but could make the 30-day deadline for the runoff.</p> <p class=\"\">Domestic, absentee mail-in ballot voters will now have a much shorter window in which to do everything required of them to cast their ballots on time.</p> <p class=\"\">Before SB 202, these voters would have had nine weeks to request an absentee ballot, receive that ballot and mail it in or drop it off. Now they will have to do all that in half the time.</p> <p class=\"\">Under existing runoff procedures, most Georgians who want to cast an absentee mail-in ballot (voters 65 and older and disabled voters will be sent an absentee mail-in ballot automatically if registered to vote) must first request such a ballot, in compliance with the law's new voter ID requirement. The deadline for local election officials to receive those absentee ballot applications is Nov. 25, the day after Thanksgiving. </p> <p class=\"\">If most voters don\u2019t mail their applications well before the Nov. 25 deadline, local election officials could be dealing with a backlog upon returning from the Thanksgiving weekend on Monday Nov. 28 \u2014 the same day early in-person voting will begin in most counties.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">The law mandates that the ballots must be mailed to voters within three days of receipt of the applications \u2014 a tight time frame that advocates warn may not be met, given that the deadline overlaps with a holiday and comes just days before the start of early in-person voting.</p> <p class=\"\">Once voters receive their absentee ballots, they must choose their candidates and mail those ballots back, again in compliance with the voter ID requirement. Absentee mail-in ballots received before 7 p.m. on the day of the election \u2014 Dec. 6 \u2014 will be counted, per Georgia\u2019s law. Voters may also deposit their absentee ballots in drop boxes.</p> <p class=\"\">Voting rights activists, who have worked to bolster awareness of the new rules through voter education initiatives, expressed concern that the deadlines would sneak up on voters, especially with the holiday.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThe shorter time frame may be a challenge to voters who don't realize how quickly some of these deadline are going to come up or who haven't thought through how they are going to vote,\u201d said Andrew Garber, an attorney at the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Under a separate provision of SB 202, overseas and military absentee voters were provided a ranked choice voting ballot as their general election ballot weeks before the general election so that, in the event of a runoff, their vote would have already been mailed in. </p> <p class=\"\">This keeps SB 202 in compliance with a federal law requiring that overseas and military absentee voters be mailed their ballots 45 days before a federal election.</p> <p class=\"\">Because of the condensed time frame between the general election and the runoff, many Georgia voters will also be looking at a shortened, five-day, weekday-only period of early in-person voting.</p> <p class=\"\">Plus, due to an ongoing lawsuit against the state, it remains uncertain whether one Saturday early voting day, on Nov. 26, will be allowed.</p> <p class=\"\">SB 202 stipulates that early in-person voting must end the Friday before the runoff. This year, that would be Friday Dec. 2. </p> <p class=\"\">The law, as interpreted by the Georgia secretary of state\u2019s office,<strong> </strong>also stipulates that early in-person voting not be held on any Saturday that follows a \u201cpublic or legal holiday\u201d on the preceding Thursday or Friday. This year, that would mean there would be no early in-person voting on Nov. 26, the Saturday following Thanksgiving. </p> <p class=\"\">But a Fulton County judge <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/win-democrats-georgia-judge-allows-early-voting-senate-runoff-saturday-rcna57983\" target=\"_blank\">ruled Friday that the office</a> cannot prohibit counties from allowing voting that day, after a voting rights group, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/15/us/politics/warnock-early-voting-georgia.html\" target=\"_blank\">along with Warnock</a> and his campaign, <a href=\"https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/democrats-sue-georgia-over-early-voting-guidance-for-senate-runoff/\">sued</a> the state, claiming  the specific language of the law suggested that the barring of Saturday voting after a holiday \u2014 in this case Thanksgiving \u2014 doesn\u2019t actually apply to runoff elections.</p> <p class=\"\">Georgia\u2019s attorney general plans to appeal, a spokesperson for the office told NBC News. As a result, whether counties can offer voting that day remains in limbo.</p> <p class=\"\">If voting is ultimately not allowed on that Saturday, SB 202 says Saturday voting should be held the previous weekend (in this year\u2019s case, Saturday, Nov. 19). But under Georgia law, runoff voting may not begin until after officials have certified the general election vote, which will be on Monday, Nov. 21, per the Georgia Secretary of State\u2019s office. That means, no Saturday voting will be allowed on Nov. 19, either. </p> <p class=\"\">Whether the judiciary allows voting on Nov. 26 or not, the only other days most voters will  be able to vote early in-person will be from Monday Nov. 28 to Friday Dec. 2. The law states that early voting \u201cshall end on the Friday immediately prior to each primary, election, or runoff.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">That five-day period, however, represents the minimum required under the law, and county election officials have the discretion to schedule additional early-in person voting days that comply with the law's other rules, Lang and Garber and others said.</p> <p class=\"\">Voting rights groups have pushed Georgia counties, for example, to open early-in person voting on Nov. 22, 23 and 27 (the Tuesday and Wednesday before Thanksgiving and the Sunday after). As of Friday, at least nine of the state's 159 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GabrielSterling/status/1593622135716470784\" target=\"_blank\">counties</a> had <a href=\"https://www.cobbcounty.org/elections/voting/advance-voting\" target=\"_blank\">opened up Nov. 27</a> for early voting, and a smaller handful <a href=\"https://www.celebratedouglascounty.com/545/Advance-Voting\" target=\"_blank\">opened </a>it up for Nov. 22 and 23.<strong> </strong></p> <p class=\"\">During the 2020 runoff election, many voters had a period of several weeks to vote early in person \u2014 and all had the possibility to do so on at least on one Saturday.</p> <p class=\"\">Voting rights experts warn that SB 202\u2019s restrictions on drop boxes will also affect the ease with which many absentee voters can drop off their ballots.</p> <p class=\"\">The law says such drop boxes can be located only inside election offices, and early voting locations and are available only during the office or polling site's hours of operation.</p> <p class=\"\">This year, these drop boxes will be available only during early in-person voting. In the counties that adhere to the minimum requirement \u2014 Monday to Friday the week before the election \u2014 those same limitations will also affect drop-box access. How the judiciary rules on the Nov. 26 issue would also be a factor here.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cIn 2020, if you had had an absentee ballot and were worried whether it would arrive at an election office on time, you could go drop of it off on a Saturday,\" said Rahul Garabadu, a senior voting rights attorney at the Georgia American Civil Liberties Union. \"But now because of SB 202, you can only do that during the hours of early voting, which can often be a regular 9-to-5.\"</p> <p class=\"\">As a result, he suggested, more people may choose to mail in their ballot instead \u2014 a fact that then brings into play any potential postal delays.</p> <p class=\"endmark\">\u201cAll of these provisions interact with each other,\u201d Garabadu said. \u201cWhen they combine, you see a cumulative effect on voters, which makes it tougher to cast their ballots.\u201d</p>"},

Kaufmann\u2019s position could complicate the overall schedule even more since New Hampshire has a law on the books that it has to hold its primary just after Iowa\u2019s caucuses.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cIf, for some reason, California and New York dictate policy for the entire DNC and they give the middle finger to Iowa and the Midwest \u2014 if that happens, we will be first,\u201d Kaufmann said. \u201cI\u2019ll move this thing to Halloween if that\u2019s what it takes.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">The caucuses are typically not scheduled until January or early February of the same year as the presidential race.</p> <p class=\"\">Kaufmann also laid into President Biden\u2019s agriculture secretary, Tom Vilsack, a onetime presidential contender and former Iowa governor, saying he and other Democratic leaders weren\u2019t doing enough to preserve Iowa\u2019s first place in line. Vilsack did not respond to a request for comment. Kaufmann argued it was detrimental to the entire system if Democrats pulled out of Iowa as a first-in-the-nation caucus since the two parties typically agree to hold their caucuses on the same day.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Iowa\u2019s Democratic Party Chair Ross Wilburn noted that even if Democrats put the state later, Republicans would still be campaigning in Iowa early<strong> </strong>and testing their messages to rural voters, putting Democrats at a disadvantage with that electorate if they abandon the smaller state.\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cWe can\u2019t allow our presidential campaigns to be solely decided by campaigns that can only afford TV ads or by corporate special interest groups who have the funds to pay for their candidate to get exposure in larger media markets,\u201d Wilburn said. \u201cWe believe we need to have small rural states like Iowa, in the mix.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">The discussion comes after Democrats scrapped the old calendar and opened up the process so all states could apply to be early contenders. That old system began with the Iowa caucuses, then went to the New Hampshire primary, Nevada and South Carolina.\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">These early positions are prized since they create an economic bump in states that are flooded with advertising dollars and on-the-ground organizations.\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Dozens of states have now applied to take one of the early state positions.\u00a0They include all of the states that have previously gone early, while Nevada is attempting to replace New Hampshire as the first-in-the-nation primary. Both Minnesota and Michigan are making plays to move into a Midwestern slot should Iowa be dropped from the early rotation. </p> <p class=\"endmark\">The Democratic National Committee\u2019s rules and bylaws committee is scheduled to meet in early December in Washington to discuss the presidential primary schedule. </p>"},

{"title": "Republicans pitched an economic solution. Now they'll have to deliver. ", "content": "<p class=\"\">WASHINGTON \u2014 Central to the Republicans' pitch to voters in the midterm elections was a pledge to <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/midterm-election-inflation-economy-what-it-means-rcna56473\" target=\"_blank\">tackle high inflation </a>and bolster the economy, but a GOP \"civil war\" is brewing over what policies could accomplish those goals. </p> <p class=\"\">Having now secured some power \u2014 Republicans will control the House, NBC News projected on Wednesday \u2014 the party will have an ownership stake in the economy. </p> <p class=\"\">In a sign of how much Republicans are going to rely on the economy, former President Donald Trump, in launching his re-election campaign last Tuesday, opted to skip his usual diatribes about the 2020 election and instead tried to make the economy central to his argument about why he should be returned to power. </p> <p class=\"\">Midterm voters cited <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/us-inflation-rate-october-2022-economy-stands-now-rcna56272\">inflation</a> as their <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/inflation-abortion-lead-list-voter-concerns-nbc-news-exit-poll-finds-rcna56258\" target=\"_blank\">top concern, </a>with 1 in 5 saying it had caused them severe economic hardship, according to NBC News exit polls. They gave Republicans higher marks than Democrats on handling the economy.</p> <p class=\"\">While Republicans sought to seize on that economic anxiety during the campaign, most candidates provided few specifics. And Republicans appear to be divided within the party, with some calling for cutting taxes and reducing government spending and others embracing a more populist approach of protectionist trade policies and limiting immigration.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThe GOP still doesn\u2019t know what its economic policy is in a post-Trump world,\u201d said Brian Riedl, who worked for six years as chief economist for Republican Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio and is now a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. \u201cTen years ago it would have been spending cuts, regulatory reform, free trade and free market policies, and in a post-Trump world, all of those policies are kind of on the outs. So there\u2019s actually a bit of a civil war going on in the GOP around economics.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Republicans will be limited in what they can achieve with control of the House because Democrats control the Senate and President Joe Biden will have veto power over legislation passed. Biden said he has no plans to change his approach to the economy, despite voters\u2019 sentiments, making a shift toward a compromise with Republicans on economic policy seemingly unlikely.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">That may mean that one of the Republicans greatest economic tools will be their ability to block further spending by Democrats in such areas as Covid response or on programs to help lower-income households, including the child tax credit and affordable housing initiatives. Republicans have argued that that type of government spending has contributed to inflation.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cLarge partisan initiatives are off the table, no one can do reconciliation, there\u2019s no path to something large where there\u2019s disagreement,\u201d said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum and a former economic adviser to George W. Bush and John McCain. \u201cThat means there will be a lot less economic policy. There will be no America Rescue Plan, no Inflation Reduction Act, things like that, and I think that would benefit the economy.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">If there is a recession, as a number of CEOs and economists have projected, Republican control of the House would likely mean that any stimulus or relief package to help struggling households and small businesses would be significantly smaller than it would be with Democrats in control given Republicans\u2019 vocal opposition to additional spending. </p> <p class=\"\">Republicans also risk facing the same type of economic blame they levied against Democrats when they face voters again in 2024.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cRepublicans are going to need to deliver on the economy, especially if the economy is worsening and inflation is worsening,\u201d said Riedl. \u201cThe Republicans will be pressured to deliver or at least put out an agenda to contrast themselves with President Biden.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Republicans have said they would block additional taxes on corporations, such as a windfall profit tax Biden has suggested placing on oil and gas companies. But passing large tax cuts or making the Trump-era tax cuts permanent, something Republicans promised to do during the campaign, would be much more difficult because of opposition from many Democrats.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">One thing Republicans will have the power to do with control of the House is launch investigations and hearings into the Biden administration\u2019s handling of the economy. Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas, the top Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee, said Republicans plan to investigate possible misuse of taxpayer dollars as part of Covid relief efforts, IRS policies and Biden\u2019s expansion of health coverage.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cOur focus is going to be on pulling the curtain back, giving the public really the right to know how their tax dollars are spent and how their government works,\u201d Brady said in an interview on Fox Business Thursday.</p> <p class=\"\">Divided control of Congress will increase the chance of another standoff over the debt ceiling that could cause the government to shut down or the U.S. to default on its debts for the first time.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cI think voters should expect some unfortunate drama around raising the debt ceiling, and Republicans may try to extract some spending cuts in exchange for raising the debt ceiling,\u201d said Michael Strain, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute.</p> <p class=\"\">Inflation showed some signs of moderating earlier this week with consumer price increases easing to 7.7% in October from a year earlier and decreasing from 8.2% in September.</p> <p class=\"\">Gas prices have been a particular concern, with 65% saying the high prices have been a financial hardship for them, according to the NBC exit poll. Energy analysts and investors have said there is little that can be done from a policy standpoint to lower prices, which have been driven higher by a range of factors, including surging demand following the pandemic, Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and limited refinery capacity.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Ultimately, the main factor influencing inflation would be the Federal Reserve, given its ability to raise interest rates; economic policy analysts said there's not much Congress can do even with single party control, at least not in the near term.\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p class=\"endmark\">\u201cThere is very little that Congress can do,\u201d said Holtz-Eakin. \u201cThey operate on years, and that\u2019s not the right timetable for inflation fighting. You have to be much more nimble. The tools they have are quite clunky. So they just need to be out of that game. That\u2019s the Federal Reserve\u2019s job now.\u201d</p>"},

The court has recently rejected similar requests from Trump.</p> <p class=\"\">In response to the ruling, the former president lashed out that the high court in a <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/109391647102814200\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> to his Truth Social account early Wednesday. Trump, who appointed three conservative justices to the high court, complained that it has \u201calways ruled\" against him and refused to overturn the 2020 election results.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThe Supreme Court has lost its honor, prestige, and standing, &amp; has become nothing more than a political body, with our Country paying the price,\u201d Trump wrote.</p> <p class=\"\">The former president's lawyers contested the House Ways and Means Committee\u2019s assertion that it needed the information to probe how the IRS conducts the auditing process for presidents, saying it did not stand up to scrutiny.</p> <p class=\"\">House Democrats, as well as the Biden administration, urged the court to reject Trump's request, saying their demand for the tax documents reflected a valid legislative purpose.</p> <p class=\"\">The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/federal-appeals-court-denies-trump-effort-keep-tax-records-away-house-rcna54420\" target=\"_blank\">declined</a>\u00a0last month to reconsider a three-judge panel\u2019s ruling in August that the Ways and Means Committee could obtain the tax returns.</p> <p class=\"\">Tax returns are confidential under federal law, but there are some exceptions, one of which allows the chairman of the committee to request them.</p> <p class=\"\">House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., praised the Supreme Court's \"commonsense decision,\" which she said \"upholds our Democracy, the rule of law and the Congress\u2019 ability to execute its legislative and oversight responsibilities.\"</p> <p class=\"\">\"These documents are vital to meeting the House\u2019s Constitutional mandate: guarding the public interest, defending our national security and holding our public officials to account,\" Pelosi said. </p> <p class=\"\">\"The House looks forward to promptly receiving and reviewing these documents,\" she said in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SpeakerPelosi/status/1595203066059440128\" target=\"_blank\">statement</a>, calling on Congress to \"enact legislation requiring Presidents and candidates for President to disclose their tax returns.\"</p> <p class=\"\">The legal battle began in April 2019, when Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass., the panel's chairman, asked for Trump\u2019s returns and those of related business entities. He said he sought the information as part of the committee\u2019s inquiries into whether tax law concerning presidents should be amended.</p> <p class=\"\">The Treasury Department, then under Trump\u2019s control, refused to comply, saying Neal did not have a valid purpose, prompting the committee to sue.</p> <p class=\"\">Following the election of President Joe Biden, the Treasury Department said that it would comply last year, but Trump himself objected. A federal judge ruled in December that the request was lawful, prompting Trump to appeal.</p> <p class=\"\">Among other things, Trump claims not just that the request is invalid, but also that the statute is unconstitutional because it is overly broad, and that the Biden administration\u2019s decision to disclose the materials was an unconstitutional form of retaliation that violates Trump\u2019s First Amendment rights.</p> <p class=\"\">Democrats have been calling for Trump to release his tax returns ever since the 2016 presidential campaign. While no law requires presidential candidates to release their tax returns, it has become the norm for both Democrats and Republicans to do so.</p> <p class=\"\">Neal said the court victory \"rises above politics, and the Committee will now conduct the oversight that we\u2019ve sought for the last three and a half years.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">The committee's top Republican, Kevin Brady of Texas, said the high court \"has no idea what their inaction unleashes.

Justice Department officials contended that releasing any more information about their evidence and witnesses in the case could jeopardize their ongoing criminal investigation and the safety of witnesses.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cIf disclosed, the affidavit would serve as a roadmap to the government\u2019s ongoing investigation, providing specific details about its direction and likely course, in a manner that is highly likely to compromise future investigative steps,\u201d prosecutors said in an August court filing.</p> <p class=\"\">In their court filing Tuesday, Trump's attorneys said they and their client must be able to review the document to know whether their rights to reasonable search and seizure were violated, and brushed aside the government's concerns.</p> <p class=\"\">\"The entire matter has played out in the media, overwhelmingly because of the Government\u2019s leaks. There is no concern regarding disclosure of the scope and direction of the investigation; nor is there any prospect of witness intimidation,\" the filing said, because the unredacted document wouldn't be shared publicly.</p> <p class=\"\">A spokesperson for the Justice Department declined to comment. </p> <p class=\"\">Trump has been accused of witness tampering and intimidation before. The House committee investigating the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol suggested earlier this year that Trump allies had been trying to <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/jan-6-panel-warns-attempts-influence-witnesses-trump-allies-rcna35800\" target=\"_blank\">influence witnesses</a> in their probe, and as president, Trump was accused of trying to<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/trump-tweeted-marie-yovanovitch-testified-was-it-witness-tampering-n1084176\" target=\"_blank\"> intimidate witnesses </a>testifying in his first impeachment trial, as well as trying to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-ap-top-news-elections-james-comey-north-america-e0d125d737be4a21a81bec3d9f1dffd8\" target=\"_blank\">influence witnesses</a> in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, including by dangling the prospect of a presidential pardon.</p> <p class=\"\">While Trump publicly called for the affidavit to be unsealed in August, the Tuesday filing was the first time his lawyers formally asked Cannon to unseal the unredacted version.</p> <p class=\"\">The magistrate judge who signed off on the search warrant, Bruce Reinhart, released a redacted version of the affidavit in late August that kept under wraps the information the government was concerned about becoming public. It showed that Trump had been hoarding classified documents since he left the White House in Jan. 2021. </p> <p class=\"\">The request to Cannon came shortly before lawyers for Trump and the Justice Department faced off over Trump's lawsuit in the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.</p> <p class=\"\">The Justice Department asked the appeals court to dismiss Cannon's order appointing a special master in the case which blocked investigators from using thousands of documents recovered in their Aug. 8 search as part of their probe until the review is done. Lawyers for DOJ argued a narrower appeal from the same order earlier this year, charging the judge <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/appeals-court-lifts-hold-prevented-justice-department-using-classified-rcna48862\" target=\"_blank\">overstepped </a>when she barred the feds from reviewing classified documents seized in the search until the special master review was completed. </p> <p class=\"\">The appeals court ruled in DOJ's favor in September.</p> <p class=\"\">The three-judge panel that heard the case Tuesday seemed highly skeptical of Trump's arguments to allow the case to proceed, noting that a ruling in his favor could open the floodgates for similar challenges from anyone who's the target of a federal investigation. </p> <p class=\"\">One of the judges also seemed unimpressed by Trump lawyer Jim Trusty's complaint that extraordinary action was needed in this case because federal investigators had gathered up personal items like pictures of singer Celine Dion while they were executing a search warrant for government documents.</p> <p class=\"\">\"This is a situation where a political rival has been subjected to a search warrant\u00a0where thousands of personal materials have been taken,\u201d Trusty said. </p> <p class=\"\">One of the judges responded that \u201cthe search warrant was for classified documents and boxes and other items that are intermingled with them. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily the fault of the government\u00a0if someone has intermingled classified documents and all kinds of personal property.\"\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">If the appeals court were to grant the government's bid to dismiss the underlying challenge, that would effectively make the Trump motion moot, since it is a part of that case. </p> <p class=\"endmark\">  </p>"},

Many are embarrassed. Some are angry. All seem to be concerned about how their state is being perceived after a constitutional amendment to eliminate slavery and forced indentured servitude failed to <a href=\"https://greekreporter.com/2022/11/12/louisiana-voted-slavery/\">pass</a> in the November election.</p> <p class=\"\">That may be, in part, because the lawmaker who authored the bill to allow the vote switched direction and worked to kill it.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Four other states \u2014 Alabama, Oregon, Tennessee and Vermont \u2014 passed similar legislation, effectively ending \u201cslave labor\u201d in prisons. Louisiana, however, did not vote for the constitutional amendment, which had been introduced by Rep. Edmond Jordan, a Black politician known for fighting for Black people\u2019s causes, like <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/louisiana-police-government-and-politics-17e06976acab34fff0f91366348a5a48\">limiting police officers\u2019 immunity in civil </a>lawsuits.</p> <p class=\"\">In an unusual twist, Jordan initiated a campaign last summer for an amendment he authored to fail. His original bill read, \u201cSlavery and involuntary servitude are prohibited.\u201d With that language, it was clear the bill would have wiped out the 138-year-old exception in Louisiana\u2019s Constitution that allowed involuntary servitude as punishment for a crime.</p> <p class=\"\">But Jordan agreed to an addendum to the bill, which said that the part of the constitution that \u201cprohibited slavery and involuntary servitude\u201d did not \u201capply to the otherwise lawful administration of criminal justice.\u201d That section, Jordan said, created confusion for him and voters and made some question whether the second part of the bill was \u201ccanceling out the first part.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cAre they trying to trick us into voting for slavery?\u201d asked John Miles, a 41-year-old Black truck driver in Monroe. \u201cWhy would they make it so confusing?\u201d He said he voted no because of the lack of clarity.</p> <p class=\"\">Ultimately, the amendment<a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Louisiana_Amendment_7,_Remove_Involuntary_Servitude_as_Punishment_for_a_Crime_from_Constitution_Measure_(2022)\"> failed</a>, with 61% voting no.</p> <p class=\"\">Jordan was fine with the amendment not passing, even though many Black voters disagreed. The measure received <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/11/08/us/elections/results-louisiana-constitutional-amendment-7-remove-constitutional-language-allowing-slavery-as-punishment.html\">more \u201cno\u201d votes than \u201cyes\u201d in all 64 parishes</a> in the state. Some of those voters, like Todd L. Sterling of Baton Rouge, say the measure passing would have represented progress rather than leaving slavery and indentured servitude in place. Its failure signifies remnants of a time many would like to forget.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cIt was a tricky bill to read if you had not done a little homework,\u201d said Sterling, owner of <a href=\"http://alphamediapr.com/\">Alpha Media and Public Relations</a>, an advertising agency in the state capital. \u201cIt really pertains to the penal system in Louisiana, renting people out, which is modern-day slavery. If you weren\u2019t up on the subject, and you weren\u2019t familiar with how the penal system treats the incarcerated like slaves, you wouldn\u2019t really think that it was a big issue.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">But it is in Louisiana, where inmates engage in \u201cslave labor\u201d at its state penitentiary nicknamed Angola after the former plantation on which the prison was built. According to a<a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/report/captive-labor-exploitation-incarcerated-workers?redirect=captivelabor\"> report</a> by the American Civil Liberties Union and University of Chicago Law School Global Human Rights Clinic, prisoners there earn between 2 cents and 20 cents an <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2022/11/10/angola-prison-louisiana-slave-labor/\">hour</a>, with many working in the fields on crops like sugarcane, corn, soybeans and, yes, cotton.</p> <p class=\"\">And Black inmates make up 74% of the Angola prison population.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cField laborers work with limited access to water, minimal rest and no restroom facilities, under the supervision of armed correctional officers on horseback,\u201d the ACLU report said.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cAnd that\u2019s why this bill was important,\u201d Sterling, 56, added. \u201cOf course, I voted for the bill because it\u2019s long past the time we eliminate any possibility of what\u2019s going on at Angola. That should have been a slam dunk. But now we\u2019re the only state that has something like on the books\u2026 And that\u2019s embarrassing.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Jordan said he wanted his bill to fail so he could reintroduce it at the next legislative session, in April 2023, with easy-to-understand language. He feared there was potential for a lawmaker to use the confusing language as an opportunity to legalize slavery in Louisiana and keep indentured servitude.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cI wasn\u2019t even going to take the chance of some ambiguous language being used and brought to court to try to do the opposite of what we intended,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cLook at it this way: If the amendment failed, on Nov. 9, we\u2019d be no worse off than when we were on Nov. 8. But there\u2019s a potential that we could have been worse if it had passed. \u2026 So, we need to go back to the drawing board and make sure that the language is clear so everybody knows exactly what the intent is.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">However, some voters remain perplexed and disheartened that, even with the language, a measure that began with ending slavery and indentured servitude did not pass.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing. It\u2019s terrible,\u201d said Robert Diggs, an attorney in Atlanta from Lafayette, Louisiana. \u201cI don\u2019t see how there can be an excuse for confusing language on a bill, especially one as important as this. This needs to be corrected as soon as possible because slavery in any form of indentured servitude should not be legal anywhere in this country and much less than the world.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Curt Simmons, an international foreign language teacher, said he paused when he reached the part of the ballot that asked about the controversial amendment. Simmons had recently returned to Shreveport from Prague and was unaware of the issues.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cMy first thought was: \u2018Am I reading this right?\u2019 I mean, we\u2019re talking about slavery in 2022?\u201d Simmons said. \u201cI looked around, like \u2018Does anyone else see this?\u2019 To see that on the ballot was shocking.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">What made matters even worse was that he was unsure of how to vote. Finally, he said, he voted \u201cyes. I was fearful that a \u2018no\u2019 vote would support keeping it as it is, and I\u2019m not down for that at all.

Meanwhile, the Democratic National Committee and major outside groups are already retooling to shift from 2022 to 2024.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s clear the White House has been preparing for the anticipated barrage of meritless investigations from House Republicans, and outside groups are an essential component,\u201d said Adrienne Elrod, who helped run Correct the Record, which defended Hillary Clinton from congressional probes before her 2016 presidential campaign was up and running. </p> <p class=\"\">Every White House has faced congressional investigations. But the surfeit of well-funded groups shows eagerness among Democratic donors to defend Biden \u2014 or at least stop Trump \u2014 and a recognition that the fight over public opinion is at least as important as the legal one, since it will lay the groundwork for the next campaign.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s important that the opposition not get the upper hand in defining a false narrative, and outside groups can help mitigate that from happening,\" Elrod noted.</p> <p class=\"\">The White House itself has been preparing for months for the barrage of inquiries, adding both legal and public relations  firepower to the White House Counsel\u2019s Office, which is quarterbacking its effort, and encouraging federal agencies to take similar moves.</p> <p class=\"\">This summer, as it looked likely that Republicans would win one or both chambers of Congress, a small group of White House staffers began mapping out likely investigative angles, keeping close tabs on top Republican investigators, including letters of inquiry they sent to federal agencies.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThere are a lot of constraints on the administration when responding to oversight investigations \u2014 even ones that are completely bogus \u2014 but none of which apply to outside groups,\u201d said Eric Schultz, a former Obama White House spokesperson who tangled daily with Republican congressional investigators ahead of President Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 re-election bid.</p> <p class=\"\">For instance, government officials are prohibited by federal law from politicking. And the White House prefers to stay above the political fray, anyway. So, outside groups can provide political and PR support, especially in the absence of a Biden campaign, and can get down into the mud on especially sensitive issues like Hunter Biden.</p> <p class=\"\">Both sides insist they\u2019re just after the truth. But the politics of the situation is undeniable and only thinly veiled.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, who is poised to use his likely chairmanship of the Judiciary Committee to aggressively investigate alleged politicization of the Justice Department, said last month at CPAC that the GOP majority would work to \u201cframe up the 2024 race.\u201d\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThese are sham investigations. You can take Jordan\u2019s word at it,\u201d said Kyle Herrig, the founder and executive director of one of the new war rooms, the Congressional Integrity Project, which is relaunching to counter the investigations. \u201cThey don\u2019t have an agenda that will help Americans. They have only one agenda and it\u2019s a political agenda.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">The <a href=\"https://congressionalintegrity.org/\">Congressional Integrity Project</a>, which already has focus groups underway, promises to be as much about offense as defense. It plans to investigate the lawmakers investigating Biden, many of whom hail from the safe congressional districts and have never faced a tough election and the kind of opposition research and media scrutiny it brings.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cWe\u2019re going to leave no stone unturned. No one has done the investigative research we\u2019ve done on these investigators. People in glass houses shouldn\u2019t throw stones,\u201d Herrig said. \u201cWe have a multimillion-dollar budget, and we\u2019re staffing up with a team of researchers and communicators.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Herrig\u2019s group is working with another, <a href=\"https://courageforamerica.org/\">Courage for America</a>, which just launched. While the Congressional Integrity Project is focused on the investigations, Courage for America is focused on the legislation and personalities of the entire House GOP caucus.</p> <p class=\"\">Among other things, that means making firebrand freshman lawmakers famous. And it means highlighting and mobilizing opposition to GOP policies, such as a proposed national abortion ban and potential cuts to Social Security and Medicare.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThe American people need to be introduced and educated about the extremist agenda of this new House and also who these members are,\u201d said Zac Petkanas, who was the Clinton campaign\u2019s rapid response director and is now running a war room supported by Courage for America. \u201cIt\u2019s a very dangerous new caucus and we\u2019re going to be there every single day making sure people know about it.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">With a seven-figure budget and support from the Hub Project, a giant Democratic dark money network, the group plans a robust operation including polling, paid advertising and social media campaigns, along with traditional opposition research and communications.</p> <p class=\"\">The third group, Facts First, was started by David Brock, the former self-described \u201cright-wing hit man\u201d who then had a political conversion and used his fundraising talent to start a series of groups that have become key parts of Democratic infrastructure. Those include Media Matters and American Bridge, both of which he stepped away from to start Facts First.</p> <p class=\"\">Brock said an American Bridge donor has already pledged six-figures to support Facts First, which he said would likely have a $10 million budget over two years. Co-founders include former Republican Rep. David Jolly, a Trump critic who has since left the party, and longtime Democratic strategist Maria Cardona.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Unlike the other two groups, in order to maintain its independence, Facts First decided not to formally approach the White House for its blessing, though back-channel communications led it to believe the effort is welcome.</p> <p class=\"\">Brock, who also founded the pro-Clinton Correct the Record, said that experience taught him the new group needs to be more aggressive on social media and conduct more opinion research to understand how Americans view the controversy du jour.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cI do believe that, absent a vigorous operation, like the one we\u2019re putting out, I think it makes it difficult for President Biden to be re-elected,\u201d he said, before quickly adding that \u201cit\u2019s the Republicans that are really making this a political issue. We are doing this in response.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Of the new groups, Brock\u2019s appears to be working most closely with Hunter Biden and his legal team, led by entertainment lawyer Kevin Morris.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Hunter Biden\u2019s relationship, struggles with drugs and alcohol, and business efforts to fund it all are sure to be a major focus of Republican inquiries. Republicans have long argued that Biden helped his son\u2019s overseas business dealings \u2014 the claim was at the center of Trump\u2019s first impeachment \u2014 but are still searching for evidence to prove it.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Brock recently traveled to Los Angeles to meet with Hunter Biden and said he came away reassured.</p> <p class=\"endmark\">\u201cI came out of that not nervous. I came out of that thinking that we\u2019ll be able to show, over time, this is a Republican fantasy narrative driven by a lot of unreliable witnesses and spurious conspiracy theories,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, the main story here is of an addictive person who has mental health issues of the kind that are in most families in America. ... I also think it\u2019s the story of Joe Biden as an empathetic father.\u201d</p>"},

Some have increased pay to more than $30 an hour in some markets, are offering up to $3,000 in signing bonuses or are holding mass hiring events to secure workers before they get better offers elsewhere, according to companies, recruiters and economists.</p> <p class=\"\">Retailers are entering the holiday season amid a swirl of mixed economic signals. <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/us-inflation-rate-october-2022-economy-stands-now-rcna56272\" target=\"_blank\">Inflation</a> remains at the highest levels in decades and there has been an uptick in mass layoffs and hiring freezes, yet the unemployment rate is still relatively low and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/16/retail-sales-rise-faster-than-expected-in-october-even-as-inflation-pushes-prices-higher.html\" target=\"_blank\">consumer spending </a>has continued to be strong. That leaves companies expecting another busy shopping season as they continue to grapple with a competitive job market.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cIt still is a very, very tough hiring environment, especially in states and cities with very low unemployment rates,\u201d said Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter. \u201cEmployers tell us that they are still really struggling to find qualified candidates and to find motivated willing candidates. So, even when they sign candidates, they\u2019re very worried about ghosting, that people won\u2019t show up on day one, because people have so many alternatives and are taking the best offer that they get.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Retailers expect holiday sales to be up 6% to 8%, with companies planning to hire 450,000 to 600,000 temporary workers \u2014 at the top end, that would be a dip from last year, and if retailers meet the bottom end of their hiring targets, it would be the lowest number of temporary hires since 2009, <a href=\"https://nrf.com/media-center/press-releases/nrf-predicts-healthy-holiday-sales-consumers-navigate-economic\" target=\"_blank\">according</a> to the National Retail Federation. </p> <p class=\"\">The holiday hiring comes at a time when retailers were already employing the highest number of workers since 2016 and the number of transportation and warehouse workers are at record highs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Before the holiday hiring rush, retailers were already looking to fill 800,000 open positions, according to the retail federation.</p> <p class=\"\">But at the same time, that tight labor market has provided a benefit to retailers heading into the holiday season because it has driven up wages \u2014 giving consumers more money to spend even in a time of massive inflation.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThe labor market is a real conundrum for employers and is one of the reasons consumers have behaved in such a resilient way because wages are increasing and there\u2019s pressure on the market, and that keeps people spending,\u201d Matt Shay, president of the retail federation, said in a call with reporters earlier this month.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">There are some signs though that the labor market is starting to shift in employers' favor. Job seekers are looking for seasonal work at the highest rates since 2019 ,with searches up just over 16% from last year, according to data from Indeed. Meanwhile, seasonal job postings are 2% lower than last year, according to the hiring website.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cWe see fewer job postings than we saw last year and more people looking in that smaller pool of postings, and the result of that is workers might have a little less bargaining power than they had in the seasonal market last year,\u201d said Cory Stahle, a senior economist at Indeed. \u201cBut we still are in this really tight labor market where even though things have cooled off a little bit, the labor market still remains really tight.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">For UPS, which is hiring 100,000 seasonal workers again this holiday season, it remains a war for candidates.\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">The company has streamlined its hiring process, cutting out in-person interviews, so that within 25 minutes it is able to process an application, give a job offer and complete the required payroll paperwork for the vast majority of its openings, including warehouse workers, package handlers and drivers.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cSomeone isn\u2019t applying to one job, they\u2019re applying to 10 jobs, and the company that best meets that candidate\u2019s needs is going to end up winning that candidate,\u201d said Matt Lavery, UPS global director of sourcing, hiring and onboarding. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to increase our odds with every candidate by being as transparent, being direct and also paying a very good wage.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">The company is on track to meet its hiring goal, but some regions remain particularly difficult to find workers, such as Minneapolis, parts of New England like Cape Cod, Denver and the surrounding mountain communities.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s hard to give a national view that\u2019s one view of the whole country.

Kelley later dropped out and endorsed Tshibaka, but he remained on the ballot. Wednesday\u2019s runoff began with the second-choice votes from those who preferred the last-place Kelley being dispersed among the remaining three candidates.

The Alaska Republican Party <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-alaska-anchorage-lisa-murkowski-elections-abbf5443c98c3b8df52973e79deb4b44\">censured</a> her and Trump began calling her the \u201cdisaster from Alaska,\u201d ultimately backing Tshibaka to challenge her.</p> <p class=\"\">Murkowski also is known for her moderate profile in the Senate and for her willingness to work with Democrats. She was one of only three Republicans who voted to confirm Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson in April. She has bucked her party in other big votes during Trump\u2019s administration, as well, voting with Democrats and a handful of other Republicans to block the GOP\u2019s attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act.

The House was called to order at noon and the chamber moved to the first order of business: electing the speaker.</p> <p class=\"\">But there was no favorite for the job. Twenty-one candidates received votes for speaker on the first ballot, with none getting the majority needed. \u201cThere was no choice,\u201d the Congressional Globe <a href=\"https://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&amp;fileName=039/llcg039.db&amp;recNum=4\">printed</a> that day.

It wasn\u2019t until the 133rd ballot that Rep. Nathaniel Banks of Massachusetts was elected speaker of the House, defeating Rep. William Aiken of South Carolina by a <a href=\"https://history.house.gov/Historical-Highlights/1851-1900/The-longest-and-most-contentious-Speaker-election-in-its-history/\">vote of 103 to 100.</a></p> <p class=\"\">The date was <a href=\"https://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&amp;fileName=039/llcg039.db&amp;recNum=344\">Feb. 2, 1856</a>, two months after the first speaker vote.</p> <p class=\"\">The House concluded business that day by unanimously <a href=\"https://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&amp;fileName=039/llcg039.db&amp;recNum=345\">adopting a resolution</a> thanking the clerk for presiding \u201cduring the arduous and protracted contest for Speaker.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\"><strong>1923: The last time the speaker vote went multiple ballots\u00a0</strong></p> <p class=\"\">When the House gathered on Dec. 4, 1923, <a href=\"https://history.house.gov/People/Detail/13820\">Frederick Gillett </a>sought re-election as speaker. The Republican from Massachusetts had served in the role since 1919 and his party had maintained control of the chamber.</p> <p class=\"\">But after the first ballot, Gillett did not have the votes needed. Three more votes were held and each time enough Progressive Republicans supported other candidates, blocking Gillett from regaining the gavel.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cMr. Clerk, it seems entirely evident that no good purpose can be served by having another ballot tonight,\u201d Republican leader Nicholas Longworth <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bound-congressional-record/1923/12/03/house-section\">said on the floor</a> before the chamber adjourned that night.</p> <p class=\"\">At issue were rule changes that Progressive Republicans wanted. For two days, the group refused to budge and on a few ballots, the Democrats\u2019 nominee even led in the tally.</p> <p class=\"\">Longworth eventually <a href=\"https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1923/12/05/102058087.html?pageNumber=1\">struck a deal </a>with the progressives and on the ninth ballot, Gillett was re-elected speaker.</p> <p class=\"\">There have only been <a href=\"https://history.house.gov/People/Office/Speakers-Multiple-Ballots/\">14 instances</a> in congressional history where it took more than two ballots for a nominee to get a majority. The first 13 happened before the Civil War.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThe Civil War established this norm ... where the parties agreed to air their dirty laundry in caucus but then to coalesce around the party leader, whoever got a majority in caucus,\u201d said Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Charles Stewart, co-author of the book \u201cFighting for the Speakership: The House and the Rise of Party Government.\"</p> <p class=\"\"><strong>2013: Conservatives plot coup against Boehner</strong></p> <p class=\"\">In 2013, the tea party movement that had swept Ohio Republican John Boehner into the speaker\u2019s office turned on Boehner himself.</p> <p class=\"\">A band of 20 conservative rebels \u2014 furious that Boehner had ousted some of them from committees and cut a fiscal deal that raised taxes on the wealthy \u2014 huddled in a Capitol Hill apartment the night before the speaker\u2019s vote and plotted a coup against their own leader, according to author Tim Alberta's book, \u201cAmerican Carnage.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Among those in the room were Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, and Tim Huelskamp, R-Kansas, Alberta writes. Republicans had won 234 seats in the 2012 election; if 17 Republicans opposed Boehner, they argued, conservatives could prevent him from getting the 218 votes he needed to remain speaker.</p> <p class=\"\">But some suspected there were Boehner spies in the room, and the conservatives began pointing fingers at each other, according to Alberta. Labrador said they actually needed to secure 30 dissenters because Boehner would surely be able to flip some of those no votes, telling the group, \"We need 30 to get to 17 because half of the people in this room are going to cave tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Labrador was right. When their names were called on the House floor the next day, some involved in the plot got cold feet and did not vote, voted present or cast their ballot for Boehner. In the end, only 12 Republicans refused to support Boehner.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Two years later, Boehner suffered 25 GOP defections in the speaker vote \u2014 the largest number of defections in 100 years \u2014 but he would easily win the speaker\u2019s gavel with 216 votes due to a number of members missing the vote; Democrats had attended the funeral of former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo and several other lawmakers couldn\u2019t get to Washington due to bad weather.</p> <p class=\"\">In September 2015, Boehner announced his resignation, after a conservative rabble-rouser, Rep. Mark Meadows, filed a \u201cmotion to vacate the chair\u201d that would have forced yet another floor vote on the unpopular speaker.</p> <p class=\"\">Typically, when a party retakes the majority, the minority leader will have a clear path to the speakership. But in 2018, after 16 years in power, Nancy Pelosi faced a rump rebellion from a new generation of Democrats who wanted her to step aside.</p> <p class=\"\">The week of Thanksgiving that year, 16 rebels in Pelosi\u2019s Democratic caucus <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/sixteen-democrats-sign-letter-opposing-pelosi-speaker-n938066\" target=\"_blank\">signed a letter</a> announcing their opposition to her as speaker.

Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, Kathleen Rice, D-N.Y., and Seth Moulton, D-Mass.</p> <p class=\"\">If her foes held the line, they would have enough votes to block her on the House floor. But Pelosi, who calls herself a \u201cmaster\u201d legislator and vote counter, was only getting started.</p> <p class=\"\">The first female speaker of the House began picking off her opponents one by one. Pelosi huddled in her office with one potential challenger, Rep. Marcia Fudge. The Ohio Democrat would later <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/20/fudge-endorses-pelosi-for-speaker-dropping-potential-challenge-1009352\">endorse Pelosi</a> and be named chair of a subcommittee overseeing elections.

A window for such suits will open for one year, after which the usual time limits will be reinstated.</p> <p class=\"\">At least\u00a0hundreds of lawsuits are expected, including many filed by women who say they were assaulted by co-workers, prison guards, medical providers or others.</p> <p class=\"\">Alina Habba, a lawyer for Trump, said in an email Thursday: \u201cWhile I respect and admire individuals that come forward, this case is unfortunately an abuse of the purpose of this Act which creates a terrible precedent and runs the risk of delegitimizing the credibility of actual victims.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">In her new claims, Carroll maintains that Trump committed battery \u201cwhen he forcibly raped and groped her\u201d and that he defamed her when he denied raping her last month.</p> <p class=\"\">Trump\u00a0said in his statement\u00a0that Carroll \u201ccompletely made up a story that I met her at the doors of this crowded New York City Department Store and, within minutes, \u2018swooned\u2019 her.

Zero. None. Not a single solitary rationale for it except profit for the gun manufacturers.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Congress has proved reluctant to outlaw AR-15s and other assault-style guns. The Democratic-controlled House <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-will-vote-ban-assault-weapons-friday-rcna40644\">passed</a> a ban in July, in a vote largely along party lines.\u00a0But the bill stands little chance of advancing in the Senate, where 10 Republicans would need to join a unified Democratic caucus to break a filibuster.</p> <p class=\"\">Biden was asked if he might press for a ban in the congressional lame-duck session, when outgoing lawmakers who aren\u2019t facing another election might feel freer to break with base voters and the well-funded gun lobby.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m going to try,\u201d Biden said.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m going to do it whenever I ...\u201d he continued. \u201cI got to make that assessment as I get in and start counting the votes.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p> <p class=\"\">Biden\u2019s remarks came two days after officials said a night manager at a Walmart store in Virginia opened fire on his co-workers, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/multiple-fatalities-shooting-virginia-walmart-police-say-rcna58488\">killing six</a> and leaving at least a half-dozen others wounded. The suspect, identified as 31-year-old Andre Bing, apparently took his own life.<strong> </strong>Authorities said he was armed with a handgun.</p> <p class=\"\">Mass shootings have been taking place with chilling frequency. On Saturday, a gunman <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/5-killed-gunman-opens-fire-gay-nightclub-colorado-springs-rcna58049\">killed five people</a> and injured 19 others at Club Q, an LGBTQ club in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Police said patrons may have prevented more deaths by confronting and disarming the suspect, identified by officials as Anderson Lee Aldrich, 22. The weapon used was in the style of a Colt AR-15, according to Colorado Springs Police Chief Adrian Vasquez.</p> <p class=\"\">The president and first lady Jill Biden on Thursday phoned Club Q's owners, according to the White House. They told the two owners, Nic Grzecka and Matthew Haynes, that they are committed to combating \"hate and gun violence,\" the White House said.</p> <p class=\"\">Biden has a long history with the up-and-down efforts to prohibit the sale of assault-style weapons. As a senator from Delaware in 1994, he helped usher in an assault weapons ban that was credited with <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30188421/\">curbing deaths</a> from mass shootings. The ban expired 10 years later, during the administration of President George W. Bush, and was never renewed.</p> <p class=\"\">Biden<a href=\"https://joebiden.com/gunsafety/\"> promised</a> during his 2020 campaign to outlaw the sale and manufacture of assault weapons, and in a televised town hall event last month, he reiterated that he would make good on that pledge.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cBy the way, I\u2019m going to get an assault weapons ban,\u201d the president <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/not-joke-biden-insists-hell-reinstate-ban-assault-weapons-1750979\" target=\"_blank\">told CNN</a>. \u201cBefore this is over, I\u2019m going to get that again. Not a joke, and watch.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">With Republicans set to take control of the House in 2023, the year-end lame-duck session may be a final opportunity for Biden to fulfill his goal before the 2024 presidential election.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m going to try and get rid of assault weapons,\u201d Biden said at the fire station.</p> <p class=\"\">The first family returned to the Massachusetts island in a tradition that started decades ago when Joe and Jill Biden were still dating.</p> <p class=\"\">The president and the first lady delivered pumpkin pies to the firefighters in Nantucket, accompanied by their grandson, Beau, who was given a tiny fire helmet to wear. </p> <p class=\"\">They also <a href=\"https://www.today.com/news/president-biden-calls-dylan-dreyer-thanksgiving-rcna58660\" target=\"_blank\">called into the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day parade</a> in New York City, offering their thanks to firefighters and service members, and said their day would be a quiet one.</p> <p class=\"endmark\">\u201cWe\u2019re just going to have dinner with the family, probably take a walk on the beach, and just feel gratitude for our family,\u201d Jill Biden said.</p>"},

{"title": "House Democrats prepare to pass the torch, avoiding messy leadership fights", "content": "<p class=\"\">Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s departure from leadership could easily have led to a power vacuum in which a host of ambitious lawmakers \u2014 old and young \u2014 publicly battled it out for the chance to lead House Democrats.</p> <p class=\"\">Instead, a new generation \u2014 Reps. Hakeem Jeffries, 52, of New York; Katherine Clark, 59, of Massachusetts; and Pete Aguilar, 43, of California \u2014 will almost certainly be elected to the top three leadership slots this week without a challenge or much fanfare.</p> <p class=\"\">There were a couple of bumps along the way. <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/pelosis-departure-ushers-long-awaited-generational-change-democrats-rcna57797\" target=\"_blank\">Some younger members are bitter</a> that 82-year-old Majority Whip Jim Clyburn of South Carolina has opted to remain in leadership rather than follow Pelosi, also 82, and Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, 83, into the sunset.</p> <p class=\"\">But, by and large, Pelosi and her almost-certain successor, Jeffries, have been able to orchestrate a smooth passing of the torch from one generation to the next.</p> <p class=\"\">Shortly before Pelosi\u2019s announcement Thursday that she was stepping down, Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff signaled he would not run for House leadership and would focus his efforts on a future Senate bid instead. That avoided a knock-down, drag-out fight between Schiff, a top Pelosi ally, fellow Californian and prolific fundraiser, and Jeffries, who is poised to become the first Black leader of a congressional caucus.</p> <p class=\"\">Hoyer, of Maryland, who has served in leadership since George H.W. Bush was president, also said he would not seek the top job and instead plans to return to the powerful Appropriations Committee.</p> <p class=\"\">And rather than taking on Clark for the No. 2 leadership post, Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal of Washington <a href=\"https://www.oregonlive.com/nation/2022/11/washingtons-pramila-jayapal-wont-seek-dem-leadership-in-congress.html\" target=\"_blank\">decided to run for another term</a> leading her caucus of roughly 100 House liberals.</p> <p class=\"\">However, Clyburn\u2019s decision to remain in leadership represented a setback for those calling for \u201cnew blood\u201d and hoping for a clean break from the triumvirate of Pelosi, Hoyer and Clyburn that had ruled the Democrats for the past two decades.</p> <p class=\"\">Clyburn announced he would run for his old post in the minority, known as \u201cassistant leader,\u201d which deprived younger members from occupying that role. It had been considered the No. 3 job.</p> <p class=\"\">Aguilar originally had his eyes set on the assistant leader position, but Clyburn\u2019s move forced him to run for caucus chair. Under a new arrangement, assistant leader will shift to No. 4 and Democratic Caucus chair will move up to No. 3.</p> <p class=\"\">That left Rep. Joe Neguse, 38, who had been campaigning behind the scenes for months for caucus chair, as the odd man out.</p> <p class=\"\">Some Neguse allies urged him to stay in the race and take on Aguilar, frustrated by the domino effect created by Clyburn\u2019s decision. But Pelosi quickly endorsed the slate of young leaders \u2014 Jeffries, Clark and Aguilar \u2014 and others followed suit, heading off any possibility of a rebellion from the rank and file and a messy leadership fight between Aguilar and Neguse.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThere are a lot of upset folks. The feeling is that Speaker Pelosi and Leader Hoyer had the grace to step aside, and people cannot believe that Clyburn is unwilling to do it. There is really resentment there about the down-ballot impact,\u201d one younger House Democrat told NBC News.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThere\u2019s incredulity at the idea that this is simply about holding onto power \u2014 not that there\u2019s a particular goal in sight. It\u2019s hard to feel like we are turning the page.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">A Clyburn spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. Clyburn has called Jeffries, Clark and Aguilar \u201cour new generation of Democratic Leaders\u201d but has not weighed in on the Neguse situation.</p> <p class=\"\">Last week, a potential escape hatch emerged. Neguse informed colleagues on Nov. 21 he was officially dropping his bid for caucus chair and would run to be chair of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee (DPCC), the House Democrats\u2019 messaging arm, if the DPCC operation could be restructured.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">Soon after, Jeffries, Clark and Aguilar informed their members in a joint letter that a rule change would be offered this week to do precisely that: overhaul the DPCC to have one elected chairman, likely Neguse, and three elected co-chairs underneath.</p> <p class=\"\">Some members have referred to that post as the \u201cchair of chairs\" and it's a structure that has existed before.</p> <p class=\"\">Neguse almost certainly would be the favorite to win that race. The son of Eritrean immigrants and the first Black congressman elected from Colorado, Neguse saw his national profile rise after serving as a Democratic prosecutor during former President Donald Trump\u2019s second impeachment trial.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">For the past two years, he has served as one of four co-chairs of the DPCC, alongside Reps. Matt Cartwright of Pennsylvania, Debbie Dingell of Michigan and Ted Lieu of California; Dingell and Lieu are now among at least four candidates running for vice chair of the Democratic Caucus.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cOver the past two years, I worked alongside my fellow DPCC Co-Chairs to engage each member of our diverse caucus to develop our message framing,\u201d Neguse said in a letter to colleagues Monday. </p> <p class=\"\">\u201cThat message of putting People Over Politics became an essential tool for our members as we defended our democracy and defied historic norms by limiting Republican gains in this year\u2019s election.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">In addition to Dingell and Lieu, Reps. Madeleine Dean of Pennsylvania and Congressional Black Caucus Chair Joyce Beatty of Ohio are running for vice chair of the caucus. It's the No. 5 slot, seen as a steppingstone to other top leadership roles.</p> <p class=\"endmark\">The race to lead the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the House Democrats' campaign arm, for the 2024 cycle will feature a matchup between two Californians, Reps.

Shortly thereafter, he unexpectedly showed up with three of his friends, whom I knew nothing about,\u201d Trump said Friday in a statement on his Truth Social platform.</p> <p class=\"\">\u201cWe had dinner on Tuesday evening with many members present on the back patio. The dinner was quick and uneventful,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey then left for the airport.\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">On Saturday, Deputy White House Press Secretary Andrew Bates denounced the meeting.\u00a0\u201cBigotry, hate, and antisemitism have absolutely no place in America \u2014 including at Mar-A-Lago,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHolocaust denial is repugnant and dangerous, and it must be forcefully condemned.\u201d </p> <p class=\"\">The president, asked by reporters for his reaction, responded, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to hear what I think.\u201d\u00a0</p> <p class=\"\">A person familiar with the dinner conversation who is not involved in Trump's presidential campaign and two Trump advisers briefed on the dinner corroborated Trump's claim that he didn't know Fuentes' identity when they dined together. The three sources spoke on condition on anonymity given the nature of the controversy.</p> <p class=\"\">But despite Trump suggesting that the event was \u201cuneventful,\u201d the fallout over his dinner with Fuentes appears to have thrown Trump\u2019s campaign into damage control mode. The former president took hours to respond publicly after multiple media outlets reported that Fuentes was present at the dinner. </p> <p class=\"\">Even the two Trump advisers winced at how a <a href=\"https://www.adl.org/blog/nicholas-j-fuentes-five-things-to-know\">Holocaust denier</a> like Fuentes was able to wind up with Trump at dinner \u2014 even if it was by mistake \u2014 along with the rapper, who had just had his <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/kanye-west-returns-twitter-ban-anti-semitic-remarks-rcna58116\">Twitter account restored</a> but lost major endorsement deals for making antisemitic remarks.</p> <p class=\"\">\"This is a f---ing nightmare,\" said one longtime Trump adviser who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of stoking the former president's ire at \"disloyal\" people who criticize him. \"If people are looking at [Florida Gov. Ron] DeSantis to run against Trump, here's another reason why.\"</p> <p class=\"\">All three sources familiar with the dinner told NBC News there was one glaring inaccuracy in Trump\u2019s statement: Trump knew one of the three \u201cfriends\u201d brought by the rapper, Karen Giorno. She was the Trump campaign's Florida director in 2016 and the former president knows her by name and sight, the sources said. In addition to Giorno and Fuentes, Ye also brought along another man who was an associate, according to the sources.</p> <p class=\"\">The source familiar with the dinner conversation said the dinner grew heated after Ye \u2014 who announced another run for president in 2024 on Thursday \u2014 asked Trump to be his running mate. Trump then began insulting Ye\u2019s ex-wife, Kim Kardashian, according to the source and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/1595965974293118979\" target=\"_blank\">a video</a> that Ye posted to Twitter on Thanksgiving Day recounting the dinner.</p> <p class=\"\">The source also said Fuentes is helping to advise Ye in his second presidential campaign. The rapper has said the campaign would be managed by Milo Yiannopoulos, a far-right provocateur and former Breitbart editor who was banned from Twitter in 2016 for inciting a racist campaign against comedian Leslie Jones.</p> <p class=\"\">Ye, Fuentes and Yiannopoulos declined to comment on the dinner.</p> <p class=\"\">Details about the dinner began to emerge on Twitter Wednesday when a Politico reporter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/meridithmcgraw/status/1595526564271251473\" target=\"_blank\">tweeted</a> that Ye and Fuentes had been spotted at Mar-a-Lago.

It\u2019s also helped land Trump in the sights of a federal investigation after the FBI in August executed a search warrant at the club in search of documents marked classified that the federal government says Trump should not have possessed.</p> <p class=\"\">Trump\u2019s statement on Truth Social did not disavow antisemitism or racism, but his campaign in a follow-up message pointed to Trump\u2019s support of Israel, the Abraham Accords Middle East peace deal his administration reached and his opposition to antisemitism in Iran.</p> <p class=\"\">But Trump has also <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/10/17/trump-history-antisemitic-tropes/\" target=\"_blank\">embraced</a> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/10/17/trump-history-antisemitic-tropes/\" target=\"_blank\">antisemitic tropes</a> and figures, implying that American Jews have dual loyalty to Israel and saying that there were \"<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/05/08/very-fine-people-charlottesville-who-were-they-2/\" target=\"_blank\">very fine people on both sides</a>\" at the white supremacist \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia,  in 2017.

Nick Fuentes \u2014 unlike so many of the lawyers and so many people that he was left with on his 2020 campaign \u2014 he\u2019s actually a loyalist [for Trump].\u201d</p> <p class=\"\">The source independent of Trump\u2019s campaign said Trump had planned to dine privately with Ye at Mar-a-Lago\u2019s library, but he then said they should eat outside on the public patio. The former president also invited the others along.</p> <p class=\"\">The subject of racism and antisemitism didn\u2019t come up, and Fuentes \u201cpresented as statistician. He was very knowledgeable of polls and Trump\u2019s campaign. Trump was very impressed but Trump didn\u2019t know who he was,\u201d the source said.</p> <p class=\"\">Trump asked Fuentes about his 2024 announcement speech the week before and Fuentes criticized Trump for being too \"teleprompter\" scripted and having low energy,<strong> </strong>the source said. Fuentes and West, the source added, also said Trump should have issued a blanket pardon for everyone involved in the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021, which Ye\u2019s video debrief also mentioned.</p> <p class=\"\">Trump also mentioned his adviser, Jason Miller, to Fuentes, who criticized the veteran operative for now running the social media site Gettr, which has banned Fuentes, according to a copy of a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/1595995970969382913\">group text message exchange</a> that Ye posted to Twitter Thursday.</p> <p class=\"\">Trump\u2019s Truth Social platform, however, has <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2022/02/27/truth-social-verifies-white-nationalist-fuentes-trump\">verified Fuentes</a> as a notable user.</p> <p class=\"\">At a certain point, the conversation turned tense and Trump began making his critical remarks about Ye\u2019s ex, Kardashian. \u201cThat\u2019s the mother of my children,\u201d Ye protested, according to his video debrief.</p> <p class=\"\">Trump then grew animated about Ye challenging him. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to win.
