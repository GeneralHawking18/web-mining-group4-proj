      "Police, coastguard and RNLI teams conducted a search of the North Wales coast over several days and eventually recovered the body of Garry Jones after he left his family home in Stoke-on-Trent A man sent a heartbreaking final text to his wife before his body was tragically found in the sea. Garry Jones, 55, had left his family home in Stoke-on-Trent on January 5 to stay at a Travelodge in Cheshire. However, the following day, the warehouse worker sent a text to his wife of 19 years, Christine, which caused his family concern. The devastating message read: \"Please tell everyone that I love them and that I am so so sorry.\" He gave details of the location of his belongings, before signing off with a final message, \"sorry for everything, love you\", reported North Wales Live. Garry was reported missing shortly afterwards - with his body found the sea in March by a catamaran crew five miles from Rhyl. Senior coroner for North Wales east and central, John Gittins, heard details of the police investigation that followed Gary's disappearance. North Wales Police used number plate recognition software and traced his car travelling towards Towyn on January 6. Later that day officers found Gary's car parked on St Asaph Avenue in Colwyn Bay. Whilst he was not present, officers discovered a note inside the vehicle, signed by Garry, which contained the message: \"I am so sorry for any heartbreak or upset that I have caused or will cause by my actions.\" Police, coastguard and RNLI teams conducted a search of the North Wales coast over several days but no trace of him was found. At 3.22pm on March 3, 2022, Rhyl Coastguard received a call from the crew of windfarm crew transfer vessel, Mareel Onyx, who reported they had found a man's body in the water around five miles from the Rhyl coast. A DNA sample confirmed it was Garry as the inquest was told he had visited his GP before his death with concerns for his mental health and had been signed off work. In a statement, Garry's wife said an accident at work and the declining health of his father had affected his mood, and he had \"started crying more\". Mr Gittins gave the cause of death as drowning and recorded a conclusion of suicide. Addressing his family, the coroner said: \"I suspect that some of the not knowing is worse than the knowing. \"The only comfort that I can offer is that he was found. It is little degree of solace but I hope it can provide some closure for you.\" Get email updates with the day's biggest stories ",
      "Forklift driver Barry Douglas, 44, and friend Claire Vickers, 46, appeared on ITV's This Morning in wheelchairs to talk about the accident which left them with \"life-changing\" injuries A man left in a wheelchair after a drunken waterpark accident took his own life just six months later, an inquest heard. Forklift driver Barry Douglas, 44, broke both his legs after sneaking into the lido with a friend at 2am and crashing into the barrier of a closed flume tube. The \"life-changing\" injuries left Barry, from Dundee, unable to work as he could not drive, forcing him to move house. The hearing in Winchester, heard that Barry, had moved to Aldershot with his stepfather at the age of 20 and had set up a stable life for himself. Despite some signs his condition was improving, Scottish-born Douglas took his own life in his studio flat in February of this year, the inquest was told. The Glasgow Rangers fan had been working as a forklift truck driver up until the time of his accident on the water slide. The inquest heard that in August 2021 having consumed a considerable amount of alcohol, Barry made the \"impulsive\" decision with Claire to break into Aldershot Lido. When the pair went down the water slide they slammed into a steel barrier that was blocking the end and sustained serious injuries. Reports at the time said they were then trapped for two hours before being rescued. Both Barry and friend, Claire Vickers, 46, appeared on ITV's This Morning in wheelchairs to talk about the incident. The inquest was also told that Douglas had a history of taking recreational drugs including cocaine and heroine. He had also spent a short time drug dealing and was stabbed in 2011, the inquest heard. Barry began experiencing a \"low mood\" and was known to drink between 500ml-1L of vodka a day, the inquest was told. His GP told the hearing that he had been prescribed anti-depressants following his lido accident. His mother, Ruth Douglas told the inquest that he had been \"desperate\" to get back to work after the accident. She added that doctors had told Barry that it might take \"up to two years\" to get his mobility back and that he was worried about \"being crippled.\" Barry's friends, having not heard from him for several days, contacted his tenant welfare officer who found him hanged in his flat in Aldershot in February 2022, the inquest heard. A post-mortem report read to the court stated that Barry had consumed a significant amount of alcohol before his death. Senior Coroner for Hampshire Christopher Wilkinson said that there was 'no clear explanation' for why Barry took his own life. Mr Wilkinson: \"He set himself up here in the UK. He started to consume alcohol to a greater extent and had been using street drugs. \"His [water slide] injuries were, in my opinion, life-changing. In his last few days there had been some hope that he was returning to work and was driving again. \"There was also a possibility that he was moving to other accommodation. It's regrettable that I cannot establish what he was thinking.\" \"He took his own life impulsively under the influence of alcohol,\" Mr Wilkinson added. The coroner recorded a conclusion of suicide.

      "Craig Murray was found dead at Etherow Country Park in Stockport two years ago but his wife Jade believes he should have received better support from mental health services A heartbroken wife has shared her grief after her husband killed himself in the same park where he had proposed to her. Craig Murray had asked his wife Jade to marry him at Etherow Country Park in Stockport, where he was found dead in 2020. The 41-year-old, who had a long history of mental health problems, had only been married for 18 months when he died. Craig had been working as a car salesman at a local dealership prior to his death on May 23, 2020. Two years on Jade, 39, says she is still struggling to come to terms with what happened. She hopes that by sharing her story, mental health services can provide better for those that are struggling. Jade said in quotes reported by the Manchester Evening News : \"It\u2019s more than two years since I lost Craig and it\u2019s still incredibly difficult to come to terms with the fact he\u2019s no longer here. \"We had only been married 18 months when he died. \u201cCraig\u2019s mental illness was putting a strain on our relationship, but I believe that with the correct treatment Craig would have recovered and we would have spent the rest of our lives together. It devastates me that this won\u2019t happen.\" Craig had suffered from mental illness since 2013 and in 2019 his health deteriorated again when he developed psychosis and paranoia, as well as delusions and low mood. He was placed under the care of Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust's Access Team and Community Health Team (CMHT), before being referred to the Home Treatment Team in January 2020. He remained under the care of the CMHT and HMT until his death four months later. During this time, he took a number of overdoses. Jade, a bank business manager, said: \"When his mental health began to deteriorate, he began thinking he was in danger and that people were following him. \u201cHe moved in with his mum just before lockdown as he kept saying he thought I was also in danger and that our home security was being hacked. \u201cIt was awful and I kept pleading with him not to do anything stupid. \"To this day, I still have so many questions over Craig\u2019s death and whether more could have been done to help him. \"I hope that by sharing my story it will highlight the devastating effects that the lack of appropriate support for loved ones with mental health problems can have.\u201d After an inquest in December 2020 highlighted \"issues\" in the care provided to Craig, his widow instructed medical negligence experts at Irwin Mitchell to investigate her husband\u2019s care under the Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust.

      "Popular and well-respected travel manager, Jennifer Joynt, 36, was found dead in her home after the love of a 'toxic partner' who allegedly faked his cancer consumed her A famous businesswoman was found dead after her whole life turned upside down and 'messed up' by a man who allegedly faked having stage four cancer in a bid to control her. Jennifer Joynt, 36, a supply chain manager, was tragically found dead in her bed by her dad, after he forced his way into her home in Manchester on February 26, report Manchester Evening News. Her family became concerned about her after they hadn't heard from her in days. An inquest into her death, held at South Manchester Coroner\u2019s Court, heard the woman - who was born in Stockport - had experienced problems with her mental health in the past. The court heard that family and friends supported her during these difficult periods of her life. The inquest also outlined that while there were signs Ms Joynt was considering suicide, she did not appear to have taken her own life. Notes addressed to her family and friends in notebooks were found by police, scattered around her room. There were also notes on her phone, as well as video messages recorded for her loved ones, in the months before her death. Police found that while some of these notes had been edited on her mobile, there was nothing to indicate they were true indications that she intended to take her own life. Similar notes had also been written on other occasions, which had not led to her attempting to take her own life. There was evidence that Ms Joynt had attempted to purchase a particular drug, which has appeared in several other suicide inquests recently. While police were able to establish that most of the companies the 36-year-old reached out to had declined the sale. There was one purchase attempt that had not been declined, but officers were unable to establish whether the sale had gone through and whether the substance was delivered. Police said they could not find any evidence of packaging or a container for this substance in the home, although when Miss Joynt\u2019s phone was unlocked by officers, they discovered that she had been visiting a site instructing her on what medications to take alongside this substance to take her own life. Traces of these drugs were found within her system. Professor Hunt, the pathologist who performed the post mortem examination of Miss Joynt, gave her cause of death as aspiration of gastric contents. This means that food or fluid she had consumed had caused a blockage in her windpipe or lungs. Toxicology results showed a range of non-lethal levels of various drugs in her system, but these were not highlighted as contributing factors to Miss Joynt\u2019s death. Ms Joynt's mum, Margaret, told the court about her \u201cbubbly and strong\u201d daughter who \u201cembraced life\u201d and loved fitness and travelling. However, she also said an extremely \u201ctoxic\u201d relationship in the months before her daughter's death consumed her, with the young woman unable to let go of her partner who allegedly faked having stage four cancer in a bid to control her. After a tough few months of set-backs, things started to look up for Miss Joynt, with the young woman in the process of buying a new house, set to start a new job just weeks after her death, and even taking trips away with friends and making plans to spend time with those around her. Her dad told the court his daughter spoke to people that were struggling and actively tried to help them and \u201cjust seemed to love life so much\u201d, leaving her family feeling like she was finally turning a corner and starting to get better after a horrific ordeal. Senior coroner Alison Mutch recorded a narrative conclusion that Miss Joynt died from complications of asphyxia, as it was impossible to tell on the balance of probabilities whether or not the young woman had ingested something in an attempt to take her own life. Addressing Ms Joynt\u2019s family she said: \u201cAs a family you were devoted to each other and as parents you had supported her. She was obviously very popular and very successful, and was extremely well thought of at work and she had a very bright future ahead of her. She was extremely fortunate to have such a caring family.\u201d Ms Joynt\u2019s family established the Jenni Joynt Foundation, which aims to help others who have faced, or are facing similar mental health challenges to which she succumbed. The 39-year-old was a well-known and hugely popular figure across the business travel industry. She had worked as a travel manager at NatWest Group/RBS since 2016, and was best-known as a long-time member of the Institute of Travel Management (ITM) and as an active and passionate member of its Northern Regional Committee. During her spare time, it is reported that she enjoyed a range of fitness activities, including open water swimming. ITM celebrated her life at its annual conference in Birmingham in April, with its CEO, Scott Davies, paying tribute to her. He said: \u201cJenni was an incredibly special, vibrant and energetic member of the ITM community. Her natural desire to make everyone feel welcome and valued set the tone at our events and struck anyone that she met. \u201cJenni\u2019s warmth, humour, empathy and talent were admired by so many of us. Jenni would simply light up a room and any situation you can imagine \u2013 a business meeting, an education session, a conference, a gym class, an evening in a bar \u2013 was just infinitely better if Jenni was there. \u201cWe miss her so much already and we will always remember her, and we will look to find positive ways to help those facing struggles any way we can.\u201d The Samaritans is available 24/7 if you need to talk.

Suicides remains a controversial subject, yet the message remains integral.

      "There was no note or any evidence to suggest army gunner Sophie Madden, 23, had planned to take her own life but coroner Katrina Hepburn returned a verdict of suicide There was \u201cno indication\u201d that a mum who was found hanged in an army shower block had planned to take her own life, an inquest has heard. Army gunner Sophie Madden, 23, originally from Wigan in Lancashire, was found dead in the shower block of the Saint Martin's Plain Army Training Centre in Folkestone, Kent. The mum-of-one had been on a night out with friends and colleagues the evening before her death, visiting a number of Folkestone pubs and playing pool in the barracks\u2019 bar before heading to bed at around 1am on June 10. Sophie, a gunner in the British Army\u2019s third Regiment Royal Horse Artillery, was seen heading towards the shower block shortly after, but this was considered normal as she often showered before bed. The next morning at around 9.30am a colleague went to the shower block and saw Ms Madden's belongings on a bench outside her preferred cubicle. She looked under the door and saw Ms Madden's legs, which raised the alarm, and once the cubicle door was opened it was found Ms Madden had hanged herself, the inquest in Maidstone heard on Monday. A report by Detective Sergeant Andrew West of Kent Police of the police investigation into Sophie\u2019s death found no signs of third party involvement or criminal activity. The inquest heard there is no evidence she was expecting anyone to come in to the shower block and did not tell anyone she was feeling in any way suicidal, or made anyone aware of any issues when she went in. A toxicology report found she had 173mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood in her system, more than double the drink-drive limit, but friends who went out with her the night before said she had drunk less than she usually would. Ms Madden had no ongoing physical health issues, according to her GP, and she was not known to local mental health services. She had been placed on a \"vulnerability register\" by the Army in 2020 after she was seen hitting her head against a wall after drinking alcohol, but after two years of observation and weekly check-ups she was removed from the list in 2022. Colleagues said there were rumours Ms Madden had self-harmed and had a \"difficult upbringing\", and in 2020 she was the victim of an alleged assault by the father of her son Jayden - however she declined to support a prosecution. What is happening where you live? Find out by adding your postcode. One of Ms Madden's four sisters, Chantelle, spoke to her just hours before she took her own life and in her police statement said the news of Sophie's death was a \"total surprise\" and that Ms Madden was \"so well loved\". She said Ms Madden had claimed she was stressed that her phone was broken and she did not have the money to fix it, and also that she was facing a bill for damages caused by her pet dog at her previous Army accommodation. In a statement, her sister said: \"Sophie was a strong, independent woman, and didn't tend to worry about things. I told her I'd send her some money and a spare phone the next day, but I didn't have any concerns for her safety or mental health.\" There was no note or any evidence to suggest premeditation, but coroner Katrina Hepburn returned a verdict of suicide at the inquest held in County Hall, Maidstone on Monday. The coroner explained: \"I'm satisfied it was Sophie who did the act ... and there is no evidence of anyone else being involved. \"I have to consider whether Sophie intended to take her own life or if it was a cry for help. There is no evidence she was expecting anyone to come in and didn't tell anyone she was feeling in any way suicidal, or made anyone aware of any issues when she went in. \"I am satisfied she did in fact intend to take her own life, and satisfied all other scenarios have been ruled out.

Therefore a conclusion of suicide is needed on the balance of probability.\" The Samaritans is available 24/7 if you need to talk.

      "The American retail chain announced plans to close 150 stores out of its roughly 900, and sack 20 per cent of staff just two days before Gustavo Arnal's death in New York City A high-powered chief executive plunged to his death from the 18th floor of a famous tower after his company recorded record losses. Gustavo Arnal, Chief Financial Officer of Bed Bath & Beyond, took his life from the 18th floor of the famous 'Jenga' tower in lower Manhattan's Tribeca neighbourhood, New York City, on Friday. The American retail chain had been hugely struggling following the aftershocks of Covid-19 with high inflation and a sinking economy. The company announced plans to close 150 stores, of its roughly 900, and sack 20 percent of staff just two days before Mr Arnal's death. The announcement cause the business to lose nearly a quarter of its on Wednesday. He reportedly sold over 42,000 shares in the company for $1million just over two weeks ago, according to MarketBeat.com. But at the time of his death he still owned around $6.5million in shares. Mr Arnal had only been with the company for two years and previously held the same role at British cosmetics giant Avon and had a 20-year career working overseas leading Procter & Gamble. Emergency service calls regarding someone jumping at 56 Leonard Street were recorded at around 12:30pm according to a spokeswoman for the New York Police Department. Beth, Bath & Beyond said it had secured $500 million in new financing but shares continued to plunge and fell as much as 25 percent in one mornings trading. When Mr Arnal joined Bed, Bath & Beyond in April 2020 a company spokesman said in a statement they were \"bringing in world class talent to offer new perspectives, expertise and experience as we rebuild our business. \"Gustavo exemplifies this and his experience delivering business transformation at other leading companies, his deep knowledge of the retail and consumer goods space, as well as his energy and drive will help accelerate our transformation plans.\" He held an undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Universidad Simon Bolivar in Colombia, and a master\u2019s degree in Finance from the Universidad Metropolitana in Venezuela.. National Association of State Emergency Medical Services Officials were seen carrying the man's body in a black body bag. The building has 57 floors and is 243 metres high.

      "Nick Phillips, 39, was working the night shift on Tuesday, August 30, when he was alerted by a member of staff that a woman had reportedly locked herself in the toilets in the Winter Gardens in an apparent attempt to take her own life and was unresponsive An ex-army man turned Morrisons manager saved a woman's life inside the store toilets. Nick Phillips, 39, was working the night shift on Tuesday, August 30, at the Southport branch when he was alerted by a member of staff that something serious had happened. A woman had reportedly locked herself in the toilets in the Winter Gardens in an apparent attempt to take her own life and was unresponsive. After knocking on the door, Mr Phillips broke down the door to get to the woman. He performed emergency CPR on the woman and she began breathing again, reports the Liverpool Echo. Both the police and ambulance services were called, and the woman was taken to hospital where she would receive further treatment. As an ex-army and former prison officer, Mr Phillips knew exactly what to do. His previous training meant that he knew compact CPR, and he has a history of tending to people in need. His wife, Catherine Phillips, said: \u201cBecause of his experience, his brain goes into this mode where he does exactly what he needs to do to get stuff done, I\u2019ve never known anyone like him. \u201cHe gets the job done, so when this happened, I don\u2019t know who the girl is, but she couldn't have wished for anyone better to come and save her life. \u201cHe is the most resilient person I\u2019ve ever met in my life.\u201d Catherine said her husband stayed on shift for hours after the incident to ensure that his staff were okay and felt supported.

      "Jade Wilcott's family, from Plymouth, are campaigning for more awareness around mental health and say the mum was failed after losing her best friend and asking for help A heartbroken mum decided to end her own life after the sudden death of her best friend. Jade Wilcott's family told how defeated she must have felt to leave behind her daughter and \"most previous possession in life\". She died overnight after a heart-to-heart with her granddad during which she had appeared to calm down, reports Plymouth Live. The 24-year-old struggled with her mental health which took a turn for the worst during lockdown after her friend and grandparents had to shield, and she felt extremely isolated. Despite her pleas for help, the young mum was failed, according to relatives who believe her death sends a clear message about the urgent need for mental health treatment. Jade was described as an intelligent, lovable and hardworking woman by family during her inquest at Plymouth Coroner's Court on Monday. Relatives said in a statement: \"Jade Elizabeth Wilcott was a beautiful, caring and thoughtful woman and mother. She was deeply loved by everyone who knew her. \"She struggled tremendously with her mental health from a young age and despite many times asking for help, she was failed. \"To take her own life, all must understand how defeated she must have felt leaving behind her most precious possession in life, her daughter Neveah. She will forever be missed.\" Jade's father told how his daughter had begged for help, which she should have received that same day. \"She messaged me that night and was saying that she needed help,\" he recalled. \"We ended up paying for private counselling because of the wait.

And then the sudden death of her friend, all these things drove her to it.\" Jade, of Southway in Plymouth, took her own life in June last year and her family are now raising awareness following their devastating loss. \"Our message is that mental health treatment needs to be there for people,\" her dad added. Senior coroner Ian Arrow noted evidence gathered from a number of witnesses, including Jade's GP. In his report, he highlighted how Jade had a \"history of depression\" and that her last attendance at the surgery in January 2021 saw her state she was \"feeling anxious all the time\".

She was prescribed medication to tackle her depression and help her sleep. A report from Livewell Southwest noted it received a referral to their Liaison Psychiatry team on May 14, weeks before Jade's death. One mental health nurse noted that Jade had admitted to taking a quantity of pills after recently suffering a bereavement. But a risk assessment considered her to be a \"low risk of self harm\" and that she did not wish to end her life. The mum had told medical staff that she had \"acted on impulse\".

The inquest heard how Jade told Robert she was going for a cigarette before he fell asleep. Robert's wife found her unresponsive the following morning and Robert made attempts to revive her.

Toxicologists confirmed Jade had taken a combination of alcohol and a 'non-toxic' level of cocaine while a post mortem gave the cause of death as ligature compression of the neck. Robert told in his statement how her death was \"a terrible loss to her family\" and described her as \"a fantastic girl and an amazing mother to her daughter\". Civilian investigator Phil Trevains told the inquest it was clear Jade had been upset following the death of her mother a few years previously, compounded with the death of a close friend just a few weeks before her suicide. He said medical reports showed she had struggled with her mental health and noted that counselling suggestions offered to Jade had come \"a little too late\".

      "Why he ended up in the Devon seafront hotel where Agatha Christie spent her wedding night and why he apparently ended his life there has never been established A chilling death that was compared to an Agatha Christie novel remains unsolved twenty-five years later. The man was found dead in a seafront hotel room in Torquay, Devon - the same town where the thriller writer was born. Mr Patel was found dead at the Grand Hotel and, next to his naked body, there was a glass of Coke which contained the poison cyanide. It turned out the room had been booked under a false name, with Mr Patel giving a fake home address in London. Mr Patel checked into the landmark hotel in September 1997 after having stayed for three days in the modest Lee's Hotel and Cantonese Restaurant, reports DevonLive. The mystery guest, in his mid-thirties, ordered room service and ate a meal of roast lamb, washed down with a glass of Frascati, an Italian white wine. His body was found by a chambermaid the next day, on the 24. His black suit, white shirt and multi-coloured tie were neatly folded on his bed, and on the bedside table was \u00a394.12 in cash and an empty wine glass. But when the authorities were called in and tried to identify him, the lines of inquiry carried out the investigators found a series of dead ends. It was only due to a coincidence that a tantalising clue emerged. Two marks were seen on his shoulder, a sign that he was a member of the Tamil Tigers, a rebel group in Sri Lanka, an island state in the Indian Ocean.

      "Kieran, from Walsall, had increasingly isolated himself following relationship problems according to his sister and moved into shared accommodation rather than ask friends for help A sister whose \u201cgolden-hearted\u201d brother took his own life hopes his death will help other men address their own mental health. Kieran Huntington took his own life last week despite appearing to be in \u201cgood spirits\u201d, according to his older sister Danielle. Danielle says that 25-year-old Kieran had been dealing with ongoing mental health issues following the death of his mum when he was 17. She says Kieran, from Walsall, had increasingly isolated himself following relationship problems and moved into shared accommodation rather than seek help from family and friends. And now Danielle, 29, wants to use her family's tragedy to encourage men who are dealing with difficult circumstances to speak out. Birmingham Live reports that the alarm was raised for Kieran's welfare on Sunday, August 14, after his loved ones became concerned for him. Danielle, originally from Walsall but now living in Stafford, said: \"The ambulance turned up first, they did try resuscitation, the police and ambulance were in attendance. \"Instead of asking people for a place to stay, he felt like, as a man, he should have the responsibility for himself and moved into a house share. \"When he was 17, our mother died. He never sought help to move on from our mum's death. \"He struggled with it for the last few years. He was always just plodding along and carried on.\" Danielle hopes the death of her brother will shine a light on mental health and encourage other men who are struggling to seek help. \"Men should be more open and talk more, express their feelings more and don't keep them bottled up,\" she said. \"Whether that is to do with relationship problems, work problems, any problem that they have got, no matter how small or big, just talk about it rather than bottle it up inside.\" Kieran was a boyhood Liverpool fan and supported Walsall, which was his local team. He also played football and enjoyed fishing. He was a plasterer by trade but also played an active role in the family's dog training business DC K9. Danielle said Kieran was a popular young man with \u201chundreds of friends\u201d, adding: \"I have been speaking to lots of people and they were saying he was laughing and joking all the time, even recently. He had hundreds and hundreds of friends.\" Paying tribute to her brother, she said: \"He was all-round nice, sometimes too nice. He would give his last penny to anybody that would need it.\u201d The Samaritans is available 24/7 if you need to talk.

He never sought help to move on from our mum's death. \"He struggled with it for the last few years. He was always just plodding along and carried on.\" Danielle hopes the death of her brother will shine a light on mental health and encourage other men who are struggling to seek help. \"Men should be more open and talk more, express their feelings more and don't keep them bottled up,\" she said. \"Whether that is to do with relationship problems, work problems, any problem that they have got, no matter how small or big, just talk about it rather than bottle it up inside.\" Kieran was a boyhood Liverpool fan and supported Walsall, which was his local team. He also played football and enjoyed fishing. He was a plasterer by trade but also played an active role in the family's dog training business DC K9. Danielle said Kieran was a popular young man with \u201chundreds of friends\u201d, adding: \"I have been speaking to lots of people and they were saying he was laughing and joking all the time, even recently. He had hundreds and hundreds of friends.\" Paying tribute to her brother, she said: \"He was all-round nice, sometimes too nice. He would give his last penny to anybody that would need it.\u201d The Samaritans is available 24/7 if you need to talk.

      "Jade Roberts, 26, took her own life just hours after taking a video laughing and playing with her kids in the garden and was described as a woman with a 'heart of gold' A young mum was found dead just hours after laughing with her children in the garden as she faced a \"hidden battle\" behind her brave facade. Jade Roberts, 26, from Liverpool, has been described as a woman who \"would do anything for anyone\" and had \"a heart of gold\", but was suffering with anxiety and depression underneath her smiles. Now, her heartbroken mum Tracey says she is dedicated to ending the stigma over the \"silent killer\", and said she had two choices when her \"beautiful\" daughter died suddenly and just hours after she was captured on video laughing with her children. Tracey described her daughter as an \"unbelievable mum\" as \"every minute of the day was dedicated to her children\", but she never realised the true extent of what her daughter was going through behind the scenes. As Tracey herself spiralled deeper into a depression after Jade took her own life in April last year, she told the ECHO she could either \"spiral further and give up\" or make a positive change and \"help others\". With the help of her loved ones, the trained psychotherapist began the process of setting up a project in her daughter's name. The Jade Roberts Project will soon be opening its building at Merseyside's 109 Rocky Lane which will help them provide workshops on anxiety, depression, suicide prevention and coping techniques as well as providing a counselling service. Those in suicidal crisis can access the project through a referral. \"After losing Jade to suicide last year, I've never experienced depression like it,\" said Tracey. \"I was stuck in my bedroom, crying all the time, no motivation. I was suffering PTSD, I wasn't sleeping. My daughter had to basically look after me. \"I have a lot of resilience and I had two choices. I could either go further and give up, but I went with the other choice, to help. I don't want anyone to go through the pain that myself and my family have gone through. The pain will never go away, I'm just learning to live with it.\" With the hope of ending the stigma and spreading the message that it's okay to not be okay, the family say it feels like Jade is \"still here\" as they create a legacy in her memory and for her children. Tracey added: \"After that I lived in the library, I did a lot of research. There's no help out there for people. I thought I have to change this. I truly believe everything I've learnt about the signs, all the knowledge I now have, Jade would still be here.\" A fundraising page was set up last year to kickstart the charity with the money going towards the renting of the building so people can attend when they are referred, as well as allowing the volunteers to get the relevant training. But more needs to be raised to ensure the help can continue, and more training can be undertaken to help \"save lives\". The fundraiser, which will go towards training such as ASIST (Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training), can be found here. More information about ASIST can be found by clicking here.

There's a five-day course in October that's \u00a33,000 each but I truly believe with these skills, we can reach out to more.\" With the hopes of an open day on October 1 and the official launch of the project on October 3, Tracey is reaching out for more volunteers who are willing to help as well as support workers and counsellors. Those that are can email enquiries@thejaderobertsproject.co.uk. As well as a 10-week project focusing on mental health and a counselling service, Tracey has high hopes for the future in the form of a befriending service, yoga classes, walks in the park and hiring a minibus for days out. A billboard outside of their building will also spread the message that it's okay to not be okay. She said: \"Suicide is a silent killer, you can't see what's going on in someone's head.

      "Friends of Mehlika Derici watched in horror as her boyfriend clasped his arms round her waist and flung himself from the cliff in Turkey, dragging her with him to their deaths The chilling final words of a jealous boyfriend who threw himself off a cliff, dragging his \"beautiful\" girlfriend with him have been revealed by horrified witnesses. Police are investigating the suspected murder-suicide after the couple fell 82ft to their deaths, in Marmara Ereglisi, Tekirdag Province, Turkey, on August 6. Landowner, Selcuk Cetiner, 41, and beautician Mehlika Derici, 35, had been enjoying a meal with another couple to celebrate their friend's birthday, just hours before the tragic incident. After the meal the pair had gone with the other couple to a nearby lookout point known as Asiklar Tepesi, or Lovers' Hill. But a row broke out between them and Cetiner pushed Mehlika to the ground before friend, Merve Y., 32, and her boyfriend, Arda Tolunay Y., 26, picked her back up. Merve and her boyfriend Arda claim they heard Cetiner then shout \"if we die, we die together\" as clasped his arms round Mehlika's waist and dragged her over the edge, before she had time to react. Paramedics were called to the scene but were only able to declare them dead. The group had been drinking in the restaurant and had carried on at the viewpoint. The couple's bodies were taken to the morgue at Marmara Ereglisi Public Hospital, while police seized their mobile phones for analysis. Some local reports said Mehlika was mother to two children. Femicide is a growing problem in Turkey, particularly after the country officially quit the Istanbul Convention in July last year. According to the 2021 Annual Data Report by the 'We Will Stop Femicide Platform', 280 women were killed by men in 2021, while 217 women were found suspiciously dead. According to data from the 'Monument Counter' - \"a digital memorial for women killed by violence\" that is updated daily - 246 femicides have taken place in Turkey so far this year.

      "Nathan Hunt's dad Derek says new evidence found his son - who served with Prince Harry - was deeply traumatised by a Taliban attack that killed and seriously wounded 10 Afghan soldiers The family of a war hero who served alongside Prince Harry claim new evidence shows that their son\u2019s suicide was linked to combat service. Warrant Officer Nathan Hunt\u2019s parents are campaigning to have his name added to the memorial at the National Arboretum in Staffordshire. So far defence chiefs have refused to budge on their ruling that his death was not linked to his service in Afghanistan 10 years before. Now the family have discovered he was deeply traumatised by a Taliban rocket attack which killed and seriously wounded up to 10 Afghan soldiers. The carnage happened in December 2007 during the ferocious battle for the town of Musa Qala in Helmand. The report states that Nathan and another soldier tried and failed to save the lives of Afghan soldiers. Nathan\u2019s dad Derek, himself an Army veteran, said: \u201cI received this report last week and it shows beyond doubt that Nathan was seriously traumatised by the war. \u201cHe had nightmares and was really struggling. He had to deal with Afghan soldiers who had been blown to pieces or who had lost limbs. Anyone who witnessed that sort of thing would be seriously affected by it. \u201cThis seems to have been ignored by people who decided that Nathan should not have his name on the war memorial. Or, worse still, they had no idea this happened to Nathan.\u201d Nathan was found hanged at his home in Lincoln aged 39 on January 2, 2018, after developing PTSD. He left behind a young daughter. An inquest seven months later heard he had suffered nightmares as a result of dealing with Taliban bombs. A recently acquired transcript reveals that his ex-wife Lainey was convinced he had PTSD after returning from Afghanistan in 2008. But he refused to get help because he was fearful of the impact it might have on his promotion chances. Derek added: \u201cI will be taking this up with the new Veterans\u2019 Minister Johnny Mercer when I meet with him next month. \u201cThere is now so much evidence showing that Nathan was obviously in a bad way after he returned from Afghanistan. I just can\u2019t understand why this has all been ignored.\u201d Nathan served with Harry in Helmand in 2008 while attached to the Household Cavalry. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox. Sign up for the free Mirror newsletter The Royal Engineers warrant officer received a Mention in Despatches for finding dozens of Taliban bombs, which helped save the lives of comrades, including Harry.

      "WARNING DISTRESSING CONTENT: A mum who plunged to her death searched for the means of taking her own life the day before she did. Raquel Wilkins' death was ruled a murder-suicide A woman who calmly looked her boyfriend in the eye as she fell to her death off a balcony holding their son looked up \"easy suicide\" on Google before she died. Raquel Wilkins, 40, was killed with her two-year-old son Denzel Wilkins-Browning when she stepped off a high point of the Petco arena, a baseball stadium in downtown San Diego, California, in the US. The San Diego Police ruled her death on September 29 a murder -suicide after the six-storey fall killed both Raquel and Denzel. The family of Raquel contested the ruling and one witness said that while standing on a bench she \"again lost her balance and this time, fell over the edge.\" She had already been seen on the bench and nearly losing her balance. They added: \"From my vantage point, looking at her back, it was almost like she rolled over the railing.\" Her sudden decision to fall seemed odd as the pair were seen happy and laughing on the day and the family's attorney claimed the ruling was useful for the owners of the stadium, as reported by the San Diego Tribune. He claimed: \"The city of San Diego owns that ballpark, it is legally responsible, assuming that what caused her to fall was anything but her intent. \"The only way the city is not at fault is if she intended to kill herself and her baby.\" Lieutenant Andra Brown said the police had come to the murder-suicide conclusion after \"detectives conducted a thorough and comprehensive investigation that included dozens of interviews, reviewing of available video footage, and collecting background information to determine what led to the deaths\". The boyfriend of Raquel contests the idea that her death was an accident and said it was \"very intentional, very planned\". Christopher Browning said she all of a sudden stared straight at him with \"an eerie silence, like in a movie.\" \"It was so quick, so fast,\u201d he added to the New York Post. \"Both of them went over. It was very quiet. I was in complete shock.\" Another witness backed up Christopher's claims in a police report and argued the act was completely intentional. \"Her demeanour walking up was so calm. She didn\u2019t even look down. It looked just like she was trying to hop over a fence.\" Raquel's mental state in the months leading up to her death had reportedly deteriorated and had broken down in front of her boyfriend before. She had searched for tips for taking her own life on her phone the day before. \"To grieve in a healthy way, you have to honour the truth,\" Christopher said.

It was around 12.30pm on August 9 when a park walker noticed a body by a tree at the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles, in the US. Officials confirmed the park visitor initially saw a tree on fire but on closer inspection a human body was at the centre of the tree. The passer-by quickly reported the grim discovery to other park visitors and called the police.

The victim has not been identified as of Wednesday morning but Margaret Stewart, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles Fire Department, has confirmed it was a woman's body. Police believe the woman was a regular who visited the Los Angeles park, according to the Los Angeles Times.

The 61-year-old noticed an absence of emotion in the man's eyes, as though he was \"looking straight through him\". He realised he was going to take his own life and called the police, reports LancsLive. Ian said: \"I was walking past this gentleman who didn't reply to me. When I said hello and I turned around and he was climbing over the edge of the bridge. \"I offered him my phone, to see if there was anyone he wanted to ring. Then I thought, what am I doing? He could have just lost a family member and that could be really triggering for him. So, I turned away and called the police.\" Have you been affected by this story? Let us know at webnews@mirror.co.uk By the time Ian got to the end of the bridge, the police had already arrived. However, the dad-of-two didn't want to stay at the scene much longer and set off home. Ian said: \"I was just walking and my dog scared this lady who was tending to her garden. She saw me crying and asked if I was OK and if I wanted to come into her house. \"I just told her that I needed to get back home to my wife and I explained what had just happened. \"Her house was next door to a halfway house type place, so she came to tell me later on that the man had been saved.\" Although the gentleman was saved, Ian has no further update about him. The experience has stuck with him and a year on, Ian recognises that charities, particularly local ones, rely on funding which they often have to fight hard to get. Now, off the back of the incident he witnessed and his previous love of fundraising, Ian will be doing a walk, completely barefooted from Burnley to Bacup - a total of seven miles. Burnley born and bred, Ian decided he wanted to do the barefoot walk after brainstorming words that begin with the letter B, choosing the starting point, destination and how he'd go about it. His love for raising money came after the coronavirus pandemic which saw employees at his work \"laid of\" for one week every month. He said: \"Since April this year, one week a month we get laid off due to a shortage in the supply chain. So, I decided I needed another focus and I was thinking, what can I do? I was contemplating things beginning with a B for Burnley and it went from there, my wife thinks I'm off my head.\" Ian will be raising money for Casual Minds Matter CIC, a Burnley based charity that help to provide professional support and counselling to men who are struggling with their mental health. \"I've never really seen anyone who's had to battle with depression or alcohol or drug abuse or anything like that,\" Ian continued. \"It's just never really been something that the people around me have suffered with. What is happening where you live? Find out by adding your postcode. \"I obviously knew people were living with it but I didn't fully appreciate to what degree people lived with it. When I do my walks, I carry my trainers with me and it's like a safety net if I decide I want to give up. \"People that are suffering don't always have those safety nets though and that's why I'm raising money for the charity. I just want to make people aware that if you need help, there's always someone just a phone call away.\" Ian has been gearing himself up for his walk, which will take place on Saturday, August 20 from St. Catherine's Community Centre to the Cornerstones pub in Bacup.

      "Billie Charity hit rock-bottom following the tragic death of her brother Stan. Here, the 47-year-old explains how focusing on her passion for photography helped her grieve and build a new life My most precious memories of my younger brother Stan are of us as kids. He was happy, beautiful and the sweetest boy in the world. I adored him. We\u2019d spend hours playing Lego and Monopoly together, and remained close into adulthood. I hold these memories close now \u2013 the boy he was and the relationship we had before his mental illness took hold in his thirties. Our parents separated when we were little. My dad would travel to an off-grid cottage in a remote valley near our home in Herefordshire to spend time with us. He was a fashion photographer and I still treasure the pictures he took of those sunny days. My mum also took wonderful photos of us, capturing family Christmases and our amazing garden, which she filled with sunflowers one year. Photography was a huge passion for the whole family. When Stan and I grew up, we lived together in London. I loved working at the BBC Learning department doing PR. But Stan never seemed happy and he returned to Herefordshire to live with Mum. I took photos all the time and my now-husband Dave and I would always take our cameras out at weekends. After a few visits back to Herefordshire, Dave fell in love with the area. He got on really well with Stan, which made me happy. I was feeling broody and the countryside felt like a better option, so we moved back and lived with Mum and my brother for a couple of years. I remember that time fondly. We ate together every night and took turns to cook. We played board games and pool, watched family TV favourites. Most importantly, we talked and reminisced. Some time later, unbeknown to any of us, my brother developed a serious mental illness. I\u2019d had my first daughter and was suffering postnatal depression. Mum was also diagnosed with MS \u2013 things were pretty heavy. Me and Stan grew apart. I had another daughter shortly afterwards. I know Stan loved them both but I couldn\u2019t understand why he appeared to have little interest in them and I resented this. He once told them they could have his old car as a play den. He once played pool with them, once bounced on the trampoline with them, once invited them to watch Scooby-Doo . But these gestures were few and far between. It became normal that Stan wasn\u2019t very present in our lives. He never opened up to me about his mental illness and his unbearable suffering. Instead, it came out as anger and him not being very nice. Seeing him became deeply upsetting. I desperately missed my brother, my best friend, my confidant. Then, on Easter Sunday 2016, after several years of barely any communication, Stan turned up at my front door. I was thrilled. We went for a walk but it soon became obvious something was really wrong. He was finally opening up but he was incredibly paranoid. I was happy that he was talking to me again \u2013 I was getting my brother back \u2013 but I was worried about him. He said he was very anxious and low, and felt something really bad was going to happen but he didn\u2019t know what. I urged him to see a doctor but he convinced me everything was OK. The next weekend, there was a knock on the door in the middle of the night. It was the police. Stan\u2019s body had been found. He\u2019d taken his life in the cottage where my dad used to take us as children. What happened next is a total blur. The type of grief that comes from sibling suicide is incredibly complex, especially when you\u2019d been as close as Stan and I were. It\u2019s like something outside of you that you have no control of. It hits you over and over, like a tidal wave. Eventually, I found others online who helped me understand what I was going through. Soon after Stan died, Dave and I moved with our daughters (then aged six and nine) back into Mum\u2019s house. Initially, it was hard because there were signs of Stan everywhere. Each anniversary without him \u2013 every birthday, Christmas and Easter \u2013 brought further tidal waves of grief and I\u2019d spend days in bed. Then, I rediscovered my camera. I had a strong urge to get far away from Herefordshire and took my eldest daughter to Hong Kong to stay with a cousin. I found solace taking photos of the amazing people and places we saw. Back home, photography became one of the ways I learned to live with my grief. A psychotherapist saw the link between my photography and my recovery. I looked up to Stan as a talented photographer \u2013 one of our last conversations was about photography. Two days before he died, he said he was happy and proud that I was pursuing my passion \u2013 and gave me his camera. Looking back, he obviously knew he wouldn\u2019t be around for much longer. He was saying goodbye. Six years after Stan\u2019s death, I\u2019m learning to live with the pain. But out of nowhere I can still get a sudden, sharp stabbing in the stomach that\u2019s so powerful I can\u2019t breathe. My physically healthy, handsome, intelligent, sweet, loved and loving brother is dead. And he died by his own hand. Did he realise that he\u2019d never get to drive his beloved Alfa Romeo again, or play pool, or walk up his favourite mountain, or eat bacon sandwiches, sit in the sunshine? I\u2019ll never see him again or hear his voice. Nor will I ever hug him and tell him he was one of the most significant and loved people in my life. Over the years, different emotions have crashed in and out; anger, guilt, hurt, sadness, confusion. It\u2019s overwhelming. But when Stan died, I suddenly saw life as extremely precious and short. I became fearless and threw myself into my photography. I\u2019m now working full-time as a freelance photographer, have co-run a gallery and published three books. I\u2019m living life for myself \u2013 but also for Stan. He\u2019s always, always with me. Billie\u2019s book Lockdown Light documents the creative ways people adapted their lives in the pandemic.

      "A dad in Orlando, in the US, is believed to have killed his wife and three daughters in a suspected murder-suicide. Donovan Michael Ramirez and his family were found dead at their home A dad is accused of brutally executing his family before turning the gun on himself in a murder-suicide. Donovan Michael Ramirez, 45, allegedly murdered his three daughters and wife in a disturbing murder-suicide in Orlando, Florida, in the US. Victims of the attack were daughters Alyssa Berumen, 22, Sunny Ramirez, 11, and Shelby Rose Ramirez, 7, and they were killed alongside their mum, 39-year-old Renee Ramirez. The family was found dead on Tuesday after they were called to conduct a welfare check on Tuesday, August 4. Police have not yet confirmed the cause of death of the victims and one of the officers is said to have stepped outside the house after he became sick when he saw the grisly scene on Lake District Lane in Lake Nona. They have, however, admitted the incident was likely a domestic abuse case. Local law enforcement said: \"At this time, it appears this is a domestic violence-related incident. Investigators worked overnight to gather as much information as possible. \"As this is still an active and ongoing investigation, no further updates will be provided at this time.\" It was confirmed a gun was recovered from the scene, but police are still waiting on reports from medical examiners to release more information. The family were killed at the home they had moved into in 2020 and locals have expressed their complete shock over what took place. Nearby residents said they suspected \"nothing out of the ordinary or anything strange\" was going on before the killings occurred. Sunny's friends Katelyn Rampersad and Amarie Padovani attended Northlake Park Community School. Both 11, they said she made them feel at home in Florida. Neighbour Heather Collins told WESH: \"I think it's like a worst nightmare truly. I don't even know what happened exactly. \"My heart goes out to the family. I can't even begin to wrap my mind around any of this, especially if there were family involved. Justin Rossilini said: \"They seemed like they were a normal family. I seen the dad, seen the mom, and two little girls.\" \"I didn't hear anything, I wish I did. I definitely would have liked to have been that concerned neighbour that did something in this situation.\" According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 45,222 people died from gun-related injuries in the US in 20202 alone. Around 46 per cent of the deaths were not suicide-related. Get email updates with the day's biggest stories ",

      "Kiena Dawes, 23, asked the police for help just weeks before she left her nine-month-old daughter with a close friend and took her own life, with Lancashire Constabulary referring itself to a police watchdog An alleged domestic abuse victim and mum of-one who tragically killed herself on train tracks was \"let down\" by the police, her family have claimed today. Kiena Dawes, 23, had left her nine-month-old daughter, Marnie, with a close friend just hours before she was hit by a train and pronounced dead at the scene last Friday. The tragedy happened 11 days after she was allegedly assaulted by a man who her family said she should have been protected from by the police. In a touching tribute, her brother, Kynan, 29, called Kiena an \"amazing young girl\" and said that the \"bubbly\" mum had just wanted a \"happy life\". But he also revealed shocking new photos showing her looking bloodied and bruised following an alleged assault after police had fitted panic alarms in her home. Speaking today, Kynan blasted Lancashire Constabulary after it emerged the force had referred itself to a police watchdog due to their contact with Kiena before her death.

But before they could locate the missing 23-year-old, they got the terrible news that her body had been found on a rail line just after 1pm, on Friday. Kynan claimed the young woman had sought the help of police roughly five weeks earlier, following allegations that she'd been assaulted on multiple occasions. He said Lancashire Police had fitted her home with a panic alarm and given her a special neckless that had a button she could press if she felt like she was in danger. But Kynan said this hadn't stop her attacker coming to her home on July 11, before he allegedly split her head open, leaving her completely traumatised. And he said the local police should have done more to help her as she attempted to bring her alleged attacker to court. He said: \"The police have let my sister down, they have. She wanted to go through the legal route to get justice. \"The girl is dead now, but it should have gone to CPS ages ago. She didn't want to live a life the way she was living, so she ended it.\" Kynan said his sister had spent her early life growing up in Cyprus before moving to the UK, and later settling in Fleetwood, Lancs. He said she had then trained as a hairdresser and began working at a local shop and had \"absolutely loved\" her job. He said: \"Kiena was the most amazing little girl from when she was first born.

      "Kiena Dawes, 23, asked the police for help just weeks before she left her nine-month-old daughter with a close friend and took her own life, with Lancashire Constabulary referring itself to a police watchdog An alleged domestic abuse victim and mum of-one who tragically killed herself on train tracks was \"let down\" by the police, her family have claimed today. Kiena Dawes, 23, had left her nine-month-old daughter, Marnie, with a close friend just hours before she was hit by a train and pronounced dead at the scene last Friday. The tragedy happened 11 days after she was allegedly assaulted by a man who her family said she should have been protected from by the police. In a touching tribute, her brother, Kynan, 29, called Kiena an \"amazing young girl\" and said that the \"bubbly\" mum had just wanted a \"happy life\". But he also revealed shocking new photos showing her looking bloodied and bruised following an alleged assault after police had fitted panic alarms in her home. Speaking today, Kynan blasted Lancashire Constabulary after it emerged the force had referred itself to a police watchdog due to their contact with Kiena before her death. The builder from Blackpool, Lancs., said: \"The police have let my sister down. They did not do enough.

      "Rory Wood's family said he lost \"his battle with his brain\" in a heartbreaking tribute, with the University of Manchester addressing \"upsetting reports\" about his death A student has been found dead after posting a series of troubling tweets about being unable to afford university. The family of Rory Wood, from Hereford, say he had lost \"his battle with his brain\" and hoped that increased awareness of mental illness would be his legacy. His cause of death has not been announced, but a pal claimed in a viral tweet that Rory had taken his own life because of the \"hopelessness of his situation\". Rory, 27, who was a podcaster, gave the University of Manchester a \u00a31000 deposit for a Masters degree but then was unable to afford living expenses. Police said he was first reported missing just after 2am on Monday having failed to return home from work and he died the following day. One of his final tweets said: \"I lost one grand in a deposit to a university because, while I met the offer requirements, it became clear that I hadn't made nearly enough money to fund the living costs after two years saving in full time work. There were no university fees in this country until 1998 btw.\" He added on his @thekafkadude account: \"Everything just feels impossible and unliveable.\" Rory's friend Phoca Vitulina alleged the university had rejected his application - but the University of Manchester has denied this. She tweeted: \"So Manchester University took an applicants \u00a31k, rejected their application because they can\u2019t make living costs, and didn\u2019t give the money back. \"This applicant, a friend, then dies by suicide because of his absolute hopelessness of his situation. It\u2019s absolutely scandalous.\" The University of Manchester said records showed the prospective student's application 'is still open' and was 'not rejected by the University'. They added in a statement that they could not find any record suggesting any request for a refund. Rory's family have since shared their heartbreak over his death in a tribute shared on Twitter. They said: \"Thank you for all your love for our beautiful son, brother, nephew and cousin, Rory. \"We are completely humbled and overwhelmed by the messages of support on Twitter. \"We realise that there are people on here that truly loved him and the fact that he made your days just a little bit brighter brings a smile to our faces in these tragic times. \"Rory may not have mentioned it on here but he has always had loving and supportive friends and family that tried everything to help him but his battle with his brain sadly overcame him. \"We ask that Rory's legacy is the increased awareness of mental illness - please all look after yourselves and always remember to speak out.  \"Rory completing his bachelors degree in politics, philosophy and economics last week was one of the proudest moments of our lives. \"We will never stop loving you Rory x.\" Get all the latest news sent to your inbox. Sign up for the free Mirror newsletter In full, the University of Manchester statement said: \"We are very aware of the upsetting reports online about a student applicant and are looking into what has been said as a matter of urgency. \"Out of respect we are not commenting further as yet but, if confirmed, we extend our utmost sympathy. We can confirm that a place was successfully secured for a Master's at the University. \"According to our records this application is still open and wasn't withdrawn by the applicant and has not been rejected by the University. \"From our initial enquiries, we can find no record or email correspondence suggesting any request for a refund or further request for help.\" West Mercia Police are investigating the circumstances surrounding Rory's death and an inquest is expected to take place. A spokesperson said: \"Rory Wood was first reported missing just after 2am on Monday 25 July having failed to return home from work. Sadly, on Tuesday 26 July, it was confirmed that Rory had passed away. \"There is not believed to be any third party involvement, and his next of kin have been informed.

      "A heartbroken family have paid tribute to a 'strong' mother who was tragically found dead by her partner as he returned home from taking their daughter out for food A devastated family have paid tribute to a 'strong' mum who left them shocked after she sadly took her own life. Coroners heard this week how Indre Razutyte, 31, was discovered at her Pontefract home by partner Nathan Price along with police after he returned with their young daughter from a meal. The mother and transport manager was declared dead at the scene by paramedics shortly after, reports YorkshireLive. Her death on March 22 was ruled as a suicide at Wakefield Coroner's Court on Tuesday (July 26). A statement from Nathan to the coroner confirmed that he and Lithuania-born Indre had split up in the days before the tragic incident, and had since begun discussing how to co-parent their daughter. He recalled having been to Indra's house earlier on the day to take the child out for food, but had received no reply when he texted her on the way back. Discovering the house empty with the lights off upon reaching the house, he took his daughter inside through an unlocked conservatory at the back before noticing written notes on the kitchen worktop. \"I saw notes on the kitchen counter when I walked in. I was concerned on reading them - I was worried and called the police,\" he said. Police officers arrived at 7.02pm and the three searched for Indre. PC Barraclough was the first to spot her through the glass doors that led to the garage and an ambulance was called. Nathan and PC Barraclough managed to break the window that led to the garage, where they found Indre. CPR was attempted but paramedics tragically pronounced her dead at 7.33pm. Indre's mother said a written statement read by Assistant Coroner John Hobson that Indra's death had come as a complete shock, with her \"strong\" daughter having made plans to return planning to visit her back home in Lithuania only days before. Recalling their text conversations in the days before her passing, she said: \"The conversations were quite normal with nothing that caused any worries.\" \"It's very difficult for me to believe and understand. Indre was a very strong person and never displayed any signs that would have caused her to take her own life. I last visited her and Nathan in October 2021 - they both did appear different and like they may go their separate ways. I believed they were trying to reconcile.\" Mr Hobson concluded he was satisfied that Indre's cause of death was suicide. Addressing her mother, he said: \"I offer my condolences to you and thank you for your endeavours in coming to the country to be here for your daughter today. My condolences to Indre's daughter as well and also to Mr Price.\" The Samaritans is available 24/7 if you need to talk.

      "On October 27, 2021, George was working at a property on Old Road in Cheadle adjacent to the railway lines. The apprentice builder was said to be visibly upset before taking a break - a short time later he stepped in front of a train A 'beautiful' teenager told his friends \"thank you for being the top lads you are\" in a final voice message moments before he took his own life, an inquest heard. George Thompson, 18, had been battling mental health problems and lows he described as \u2018thunderstorms\u2019 before his death. His dad, Dave Thompson, described George's death as the \u2018hardest thunderstorm yet\u2019. On October 27, 2021, George was working at a property on in Cheadle. The apprentice builder was said to be visibly upset before taking a break - a short time later he was hit by a train. He answered a call from his friend, Alex Mills, who urged him to step away and tried to tell him how much he had going for him. Unfortunately, George did not respond to these pleas. \u201cHe was a wonderful young lad,\u201d his father told an inquest at the Coroner\u2019s Court in Stockport. \u201cHe was so caring and would do anything for anyone. \u201cHe really loved helping people and he got a lot from that. He was everything you would want as a parent. He loved us and we loved him. He was just everything. He was funny, so funny. At the drop of a hat he could just have us laughing. \u201cGeorge was the most beautiful, caring, intelligent, reliable, funny, loyal, handsome, courteous, polite, son and brother a parent could ever wish for. There was so much to come but we shall have to treasure the memories we have. But they\u2019re not enough. We wanted more.\u201d Mr Thompson explained that George's good moments far outweighed the bad, reports the Manchester Evening News. The lifelong Stockport County fan had often struggled with his mental health and previously tried to take his own life on September 15 but had misjudged when it was coming and was taken into hospital. He told the mental health team at Stepping Hill Hospital he was \u2018gutted\u2019 by what had happened. During the inquest, Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust were subjected to criticism from George's family, who could not believe the teen was assessed as low risk by the mental health team despite being considered a higher risk just three hours prior. \u201cThe GP was shocked when I told him George was allowed home,\u201d Dave Thompson said. \u201cI can\u2019t get away from the fact that three hours before he was classed as high risk but when he was in the room with Ms Dunne (conducting the mental health assessment) he was deemed low risk. \u201cThere was almost no common sense thinking allowed and they have to stick to this criteria. Everything seems so rigid.\u201d On a number of occasions throughout the inquest, Mr Thompson and his son Will both stated \u201csomething needs to change\u201d. After George's death the trust conducted an investigation, which they say is a standard procedure when someone known to mental health services dies. No actions were put in place by Pennine Care as a result of the report but the trust says they listened to the family's concerns and staff have taken them on board. According to his therapist Mike Andrews, George was making progress in his battle with the \u2018thunderclouds\u2019 in his mind and was really engaged with his sessions as well as those he had with Karen Taylor of Healthy Minds. Both clinical professionals spoke highly of George and his determination to heal himself, but these \u2018thunderclouds got the better of him in the end\u2019, Mr Andrews said. After coming to a conclusion of suicide, assistant coroner Anna Morris said: \u201cIt is hard not to have been moved by how much he was loved by all who knew him.\u201d George\u2019s mum Caroline, dad David, and brother Will thanked all those who have supported them through this time including Stockport County football club, those assisting the coronal investigation and everyone who has shared wonderful stories of George.

He was everything you would want as a parent. He loved us and we loved him. He was just everything. He was funny, so funny. At the drop of a hat he could just have us laughing. \u201cGeorge was the most beautiful, caring, intelligent, reliable, funny, loyal, handsome, courteous, polite, son and brother a parent could ever wish for. There was so much to come but we shall have to treasure the memories we have. But they\u2019re not enough. We wanted more.\u201d Mr Thompson explained that George's good moments far outweighed the bad, reports the Manchester Evening News. The lifelong Stockport County fan had often struggled with his mental health and previously tried to take his own life on September 15 but had misjudged when it was coming and was taken into hospital. He told the mental health team at Stepping Hill Hospital he was \u2018gutted\u2019 by what had happened. During the inquest, Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust were subjected to criticism from George's family, who could not believe the teen was assessed as low risk by the mental health team despite being considered a higher risk just three hours prior. \u201cThe GP was shocked when I told him George was allowed home,\u201d Dave Thompson said. \u201cI can\u2019t get away from the fact that three hours before he was classed as high risk but when he was in the room with Ms Dunne (conducting the mental health assessment) he was deemed low risk. \u201cThere was almost no common sense thinking allowed and they have to stick to this criteria. Everything seems so rigid.\u201d On a number of occasions throughout the inquest, Mr Thompson and his son Will both stated \u201csomething needs to change\u201d. After George's death the trust conducted an investigation, which they say is a standard procedure when someone known to mental health services dies. No actions were put in place by Pennine Care as a result of the report but the trust says they listened to the family's concerns and staff have taken them on board. According to his therapist Mike Andrews, George was making progress in his battle with the \u2018thunderclouds\u2019 in his mind and was really engaged with his sessions as well as those he had with Karen Taylor of Healthy Minds. Both clinical professionals spoke highly of George and his determination to heal himself, but these \u2018thunderclouds got the better of him in the end\u2019, Mr Andrews said. After coming to a conclusion of suicide, assistant coroner Anna Morris said: \u201cIt is hard not to have been moved by how much he was loved by all who knew him.\u201d George\u2019s mum Caroline, dad David, and brother Will thanked all those who have supported them through this time including Stockport County football club, those assisting the coronal investigation and everyone who has shared wonderful stories of George.

      "An inquest has heard how Bailey Reay, 13, sent a heartbreaking 'final goodbye' voice-note to his crush, before being found unresponsive at his grandmother's home A 13-year-old schoolboy sent a heartbreaking final 'last goodbye' message to a girl he fancied before his tragic death, an inquest has heard. Bailey Reay, from Sunderland, was found unresponsive at his grandmother's home where he lived on 19 December 2020. Emergency services were immediately called, but he was tragically pronounced dead - leaving his family and friends devastated, report Chronicle Live. An inquest - held at City Hall on Wednesday - heard how Bailey resided with his grandmother. On December 18, he was left in the care of his grandmother's aunt and they spent some time together eating pizza. It was also heard how Bailey also spent some time in his room playing on his PlayStation. But, by midday on December 19, Bailey was found unresponsive and the emergency services were called but he tragically passed away. The teenager was found in his room with an empty bottle of medication that was originally prescribed to his grandmother. A post-mortem was carried out and toxicology was taken and it was found that Bailey had alcohol and medication, which was eight times a large therapeutic dose, in his system. The pathologist found that Bailey died as a result of the effects of the medication and alcohol which it was heard can impact the central nervous system. The inquest heard there were a number of things that caused Bailey concern including \"difficult family dynamics\" and school though recent records suggested he had got back into school and that it seemed to be going well. Following Bailey's death, some concerns were raised over the issue of bullying and police seized his computer and mobile phone which was protected by a pin. However, the inquest heard that nothing specific was identified. However, they did find a voicemail that Bailey had left a girl who he had a crush on which said: \"I have had a crush on you for the longest time so I guess this is goodbye.\" Assistant coroner, Karin Welsh, said Bailey had admitted taking medication in the voicemail he left to his crush and recorded a verdict of suicide. She told his family: \"Why doesn't fall within the remit of an inquest. There were a number of factors in Bailey's life that must have been causing him concern.\" The Samaritans is available 24/7 if you need to talk.

      "Daryl McWilliam, 24, was found dead in his hotel room after drunkenly texting his girlfriend of 12 months that he didn't want to 'be with her anymore' An \"amazing\" 24-year-old dad took his own life after splitting up with his girlfriend during a weekend away in Blackpool. An inquest heard Daryl McWilliam had travelled to the seaside resort with his girlfriend of 12 months, Natalie Jones. The couple, from Kilmarnock, Scotland, visited Wetherspoons for something to eat before returning to their room at Garvey's Promenade Hotel on Saturday February 26. The pair then decided to go back out and visit three pubs in Blackpool town centre, Lancs Live reports. Towards the end of the night, it is reported that Daryl, 24, became increasingly intoxicated and, after becoming separated from Natalie, he sent her a text saying: \"I don't want to be with you anymore.\" Shocked at this, Natalie then made several attempts to contact Daryl who eventually returned to the hotel at around midnight. The couple had an argument, during which Daryl damaged Natalie's phone and other belongings in the room, before she started to pack her things into their car. When Natalie went back to the room, Daryl wasn't there, and so she went downstairs to the bar to look for him. A short while later Natalie went back up to the room where she found Daryl unconscious. Paramedics and police were called but despite extensive resuscitation efforts Daryl was pronounced dead at 1.37am on February 27. The cause of death was given as hanging. An inquest at Blackpool Town Hall today (Tuesday July 19) heard that Daryl, a pipe-fitter at Kilmaurs engineering firm A&L Mechanical Installations, had no history of mental health issues. He had visited the GP with his mum in 2020 for help with low mood but he was not known to the community mental health team. The content of the messages sent by Daryl indicate he was intoxicated. This tragic incident would appear to have stemmed from the breakdown of the relationship on a night which involved alcohol consumption. Assistant Coroner Louise Rae returned a conclusion of suicide. She said: \"Daryl McWilliam was on holiday in Blackpool with his partner. Following an argument she returned to the room to find him hanging. He was not known to mental health services. \"I agree this was a tragic incident which stemmed from the breakdown of a relationship. In terms of the evidence...I don't believe anybody could have acted sooner. \"It is difficult to find any conclusion other than suicide...I am therefore satisfied that the only conclusion possible and the one that I reach is the short-form conclusion of suicide.\" A fundraiser launched after Daryl's death, to help his parents Heather and John pay for the funeral, raised more than \u00a32,200. Daryl's girlfriend Natalie paid tribute to him after his death, as reported by the Daily Record, in which she described him as \"the most amazing person\" she had ever known. She added: \"You showed me what true love actually is. I will always love you Daryl. I really wish I had gotten more time with you and got to do everything we planned on. You never failed to make me smile whenever I felt down and I can\u2019t thank you enough for how happy you made me.\" Samaritans (116 123) operates a 24-hour service available every day of the year.

      "WARNING DISTRESSING CONTENT Eve Lewis, 15, was a popular and bright student but had struggled with anorexia in the latter part of 2020 in her \"quest for perfection\" A teenage girl who dreamed of becoming a lawyer went out for a walk with her dog but sadly never returned. Eve Lewis, 15, was hit by a train after going for a wander with her pet instead of out with her family on September 26 last year. The Lancashire schoolgirl dreamed of becoming a lawyer and was predicted top grades in her GCSEs. A popular pupil, Eve's family say she tried her best in everything and had recently discovered a new passion for both art and drama. They were not worried when she told them she would head out to walk the dog instead of joining them on a trip out last year and, while she battled anorexia, at times becoming \"painfully thin\", relatives \"thought that she was over the worst of it and had her spark back\". \u201cThere was nothing to suggest that when she went out to walk the dog that day, that she wouldn't be coming home again,\" her family told LancsLive. \"There were no cries for help. Eve had so many things to look forward to and so many plans for the future. \"We don\u2019t believe Eve wanted to die; she wanted to put an end to the torment she was in. That torment was anorexia.\" Eve died after being hit by a train and her dog was later found running free in a nearby field by a passer-by. The talented youngster, who was in her final year at Burscough Priory Academy, had developed the eating disorder in the latter part of 2020 in her \"quest for perfection\". Her mum Paula noticed she had lost a considerable amount of weight but, initially, Eve still appeared to be eating \"normal\" meals at home in Burscough. However, as 2021 started, and Eve was forced to home-school because of lockdown, she became obsessed with her food intake. By the Easter holidays she \"wouldn't even allow herself\" to enjoy the Sunday lunch her mum had made and her weight plummeted to less than six stone. By April 2021 mum Paula, a retired police officer, had become so concerned that she took Eve to see the GP who recorded her weight as just 37kg, or five stone eight pounds. The following day she was called by the eating disorder clinic who advised Eve's parents to not allow her to eat low fat food but after that \"she just refused to eat at all\", her mum said. At an inquest at Preston Coroner's Court today, Paula said: \"We were told to persevere and we would spend hours every day trying to get her to eat. \"She would be crying, I would be crying and it was absolutely horrendous. It got to the stage where she was terrified of food. She would hold a fork up to her mouth and her hand would be shaking.\" In May 2021, as Eve's physical condition deteriorated and she became \"painfully thin\", she attended an appointment with the eating disorder service's practitioners and a GP. The doctor was so worried about Eve's low heart rate, caused by starvation, that he sent her to A&E with her family advised to pack a bag as it was likely she would be admitted. Dr Johnstone told the inquest: \"I was particularly struck by the terrific efforts of mum and dad who had done everything to try and help her. \"They spoke of spending six hours a day trying to get her to eat. It was a very clear decision to admit her to hospital because despite all of that she was becoming more and more unwell.\" When she was admitted to Southport and Ormskirk District General Hospital, 15-year-old Eve weighed 36.55kg - five and a half stone. She was only allowed out of bed in a wheelchair because of her frailty and she told medics that she was \"worried she would lose control in hospital and become fat\". \"She still had a sense of humour though,\" mum Paula told the inquest. \"I remember at one point they asked if she had any allergies and she said 'oil, fat, butter, sugar....' and was joking.\" After being warned that she would have to have a nasal feeding tube inserted if she continued to refuse food, Eve slowly began to eat while in hospital. By the time she was discharged, four weeks later, she had gained over 5kg. By September Eve, who was born in Ormskirk, had managed to gain more weight and she was deemed well enough to return to school. She asked her mum if she could have highlights put in her hair and her eyebrows tinted \"so that if anyone says I look different I can say that's why\", Eve told Paula. Headteacher Lucy MacLaren described Eve as a \"beautiful girl\"' who loved netball and who \"contributed in every way possible to the school\".

On the morning of Sunday September 26, the family were due to go out but Eve had stayed at home because she was worried a \"food situation\" would present itself and she would feel embarrassed.

Robert Needham, 42, killed his wife Kelly Fitzgibbons, 40, and his two daughters, Ava, four, Lexi, two, and their dog at their \u00a3600,000 home before taking his own life. The tragedy happened in the quiet village of Woodmancote in West Sussex just a week into lockdown in March 2020. Kelly\u2019s uncle, Ronald Peacock, told an inquest in Horsham, West Sussex, on Tuesday about the moment he found their bodies after climbing through an open window into the couple's bedroom. Mr Peacock added: \"I realised I could see Ava\u2019s head on the bed, under the duvet. Both girls laying side by side in the bed. \u201cI could see Kelly on the floor, near the door. Rob was on the floor in the hallway. I climbed through the window. \u201cThe TV was on and I could see blood on the pillows. I could tell they were both dead. \u201cKelly was dead. It was obvious from the position and the amount of blood there was nothing I could do for her.\" He also said he found Needham lying in the hallway with the shotgun pointed at his head. He then called 999. The Sun reports he said: \"I could feel the cold on the back of my head. Kelly was cold, Ava was cold and Lexi too was cold.\u201d The inquest was also told Needham was a secret cocaine user and, in the days leading up to the tragedy, had tried to get hold of the drug from a supplier without success. The inquest heard toxicology tests also showed he had not taken any cocaine at the time of the tragedy, but a hair sample test showed he had been a \"cocaine user\". It was also said that in the past he had been forced to see a doctor over the damage the drug had caused to his nose. It was also said Needham had been suffering financial problems in the run-up to the Covid lockdown in March 2020. The family had earlier moved into his family home to help care for his mother, Maureen, 77, after his father Rex, who suffered from Parkinson's disease, died in 2017. They lived upstairs rent-free while his mother lived in a \"granny flat\" downstairs. He was building an extension to the house but the family had run into financial problems and had stopped contributing to the bills. The builder had also been forced to take out a loan of \u00a320,000 from his mother to cover his family's day-to-day living. When Covid struck, Needham found it difficult getting hold of building supplies and had to put the work extension on hold, it was said. In a statement to the hearing, Kelly's twin sister, Emma Ambler, said she did not believe the couple had any serious money worries. The inquest heard how Needham had a history of mental illness and an official caution for theft but omitted it when applying for a firearms licence in 2016. He was issued with a firearms licence despite admitting the lies to a police officer, a coroner was told. He then used the certificate to buy a semi-automatic shotgun shortly before killing his family. Needham declared on the application he had never had a criminal conviction and had no history of mental health problems. However, he had previously suffered at least two bouts of mental health problems in 2003 and 2013 and had been treated for depression, it was said. He had also previously been issued with a caution from police for stealing a bicycle going back many years. At the time of his application, a firearms enquiry officer from Hampshire Police questioned Needham at this home, the inquest heard. When Needham was told his GP would be contacted in relation to the application he then told the cop about his mental health problems and admitted having a criminal conviction. The hearing was told he told the officer he did not think they were relevant because they were a long time ago. Chief Inspector Nigel Lecointe of Hampshire said he would have expected greater scrutiny of the application. He said the omissions should have been a \u201ccause for concern\u201d and raised a red flag. Guidance for firearms licensing in 2016 stated: \u201cWhether the applicant is found to have made a false statement is of particular relevance. \"Deliberate failure to declare relevant convictions, medical conditions or medical history tends to show unfitness regardless of whether the certificate would have been refused if the appropriate declaration had been made.\u201d The firearms licence was approved by Sussex Police after Needham and the family moved to the county. The hearing was told Hampshire Police was minded to grant the firearms certificate but Mr Needham moved home and the decision to grant final approval was transferred to the Sussex force. Firearms licences are valid for five years. Mr Lecointe told the court: \u201cWe should never be complacent about what we do. Our job is to try and do the right thing but we will make judgements with the best intentions. We won\u2019t always get it right but we will try.\u201d The inquest continues.

      "Baggage handler Richard Russell, 29, was wearing a T-shirt with \"The Sky's No Limit\" written on his back as he opened the door of an Alaskan Airlines propeller jet, jumped in the cockpit and flew 30 miles before taking his own life when he crashed on a remote island A clip has surfaced showing the moment an airport worker hijacked a plane before plunging the aircraft through the air and crash landing on a remote island in an apparent suicide. Surveillance footage from Seattle Airport shows baggage handler Richard Russell, 29, moving through the transit hub wearing a a T-shirt with \"The Sky's No Limit\" emblazoned across the back. The clip, recorded in August 2018, then shows Russell heading towards the airport's cargo area around five hours after clearing security. With colleagues walking nearby, he's seen pushing an Alaska Airlines propeller aircraft on to the runway. Air traffic agents tried to make contact with the plane but received no response. He then opens the cabin door, jumps in the cockpit and takes off in the Q400 Turboprop - which is designed for short to medium haul journeys. He tells air traffic control: \"Seattle ground Horizon guy. About to take off. It's gonna be crazy. \"Hey, I found myself in a predicament. I'm in the air right now. And just gonna soar around.\" As he soars above Washington state as air traffic controllers beg him to make a safe landing. But Russell won't be swayed and continues to make disturbing jokes with the men in the tower trying to find somewhere he can set the plane down. He says: \"Hey do you think if I land this successfully Alaska will give me a job as a pilot?\" After asking if he could see a suitable runway, he replies: \"Oh those guys will try to rough me up if I try land there\u2026 I think I might mess something up there too. I wouldn't want to do that. Oh they probably have got anti-aircraft.\" The traffic controller responds: \"They don't have any of that stuff, we are just trying to find you a place to land safely.\" At one point, he says he's \"just a broken guy\" and that he is preparing for \"jail time for life\". According to the Seattle Times, he said he feared disappointing \"people that care about me\" by hijacking the aircraft. He added: \"I would like to apologise to each and every one of them. Just a broken guy, got a few screws loose, I guess. Never really knew it, until now.\" Moments after the plane took off, two US F-15 fighter jets headed to his position but couldn't intercept him before his tragic descent. Russell crashed on a remote island 30 miles away from Seattle. He died around 90 minutes after taking off. People on the ground reported seeing him performing aerial acrobatics, including barrel rolls and loop-the-loops in the air. Sheriff Paul Pastor said Russell's was like \"a joyride gone terribly wrong\". An FBI report revealed how Russell said he knew how to fly the aircraft solo because he'd played video games in the past. The report said there was no \"clear motivation\" for his bizarre actions after investigators probed his \"background, possible stressors and personal life\".

      "Craig Cambridge, 51, saw his life \"spiralling downwards\" after his daughter, Leah, died following a botched Brazilian butt lift in 2018 and tragically took his own life A dad took his own life after his daughter died following a botched Brazilian butt lift operation in Turkey. Craig Cambridge, 51, found his life \u201cspiralling downwards\u201d after his 29-year-old daughter Leah Cambridge died following a 2018 operation in Turkey that went wrong. The dad was tragically found dead at his home in Leeds and an inquest has found how he had never been able to get over Leah\u2019s awful death. On the day he died, he had tried to ring doctors three times before his death but they had been closed because it was a bank holiday, Leeds Live reports . After an investigation into his death, senior coroner Kevin McLoughlin said he would be contacting the surgeon who botched Leah\u2019s operation. Craig struggled with alcohol dependency and depression after his daughter\u2019s tragic death, Wakefield Coroners' Court heard. On April, 5, 2021, his daughter's partner found Craig dead in his loft. This came nearly three years after Leah died in Izmir, Turkey, in August 2018. She died from a pulmonary embolism after Dr Ali Uckan accidentally injected fat into her veins. Leah had three heart attacks at the operating table. Mr McLoughlin conducted the inquests for the dad and daughter and said he wanted to let Dr Ali Uckan know the damage his surgery caused. He said to Craig's daughters Hayley and Chelsea and ex-partner Theresa Hall: \u201cNormally I am quite detached and hard-hearted about inquests, but when I saw another tragedy had befallen your family, I felt quite grievous. \u201cHaving conducted the inquest into Leah all those years ago, I was incensed that the surgeon in Turkey stood well clear. \u201cI am proposing to send the report to the surgeon to make him aware of the tentacles of this. \u201cI am intending to send it to the medical authorities in Turkey to make them aware of how a tragedy manifests itself years later. \u201cI feel dreadfully sorry for you as a family.\u201d Chelsea and her partner had gone to see him on April 5, 2021, but when they were unable to get in, Chelsea\u2019s partner ended up climbing through a window. What is happening where you live? Find out by adding your postcode. It was then he found the body of the former personal trainer and called paramedics. Craig was tragically pronounced dead at 7:50pm that evening. He had left notes for both his daughters. Craig had a history of depression and anxiety that became much worse after Leah\u2019s death. He had been on medication and turned to alcohol and was under the care of a community mental health team. Police also found that the morning he took his own life he had tried to call doctors three times, but they were closed because it was a bank holiday. Dr Uckan did speak at Leah's inquest, where he called the operation \u201ca guessing game\u201d, speaking to Leah's widower Scott. Mr McLoughlin branded the surgeon a \u201ccoward\u201d back in 2019 for not answering her family's questions. The coroner said that he had written to the doctor eight times since to ask him to give evidence at Craig's inquest - but got no response. As he returned a verdict of suicide today, Mr McLoughlin said: \u201cI am reliant upon on the pathologist for the cause of death, which in this case is hanging. \u201cThis was a suicide attributed in part to the death of his daughter who died in surgery in Turkey.\u201d The Samaritans is available 24/7 if you need to talk.

      "New research by Deaths by Welfare concludes the Department for Work and Pensions failed to fix systematic flaws in the disability benefits system that potentially led to thousands of deaths You can listen to an audio version of this article here The Government\u2019s failure to act on warnings about its disability benefits systems has been linked to hundreds \u2013 maybe even \u00adthousands \u2013 of suicides and other deaths of disabled people. A detailed 160-page study published today exposes how the Department for Work and Pensions was alerted more than 40 times to life-threatening systemic flaws, by academics, coroners and its own researchers over the past 30 years. The Mirror has been given exclusive access to the Deaths by Welfare Timeline, which brings together for the first time the three decades of \u00adinvestigations linking DWP and its social security reforms with the deaths of disabled benefit claimants. It documents the DWP\u2019s \u201ccumulative harm\u201d and \u201cslow bureaucratic violence\u201d that has led to countless suicides and other deaths, particularly in the post-2010 austerity era. One piece of research connects just one area of the 2010 coalition government\u2019s welfare reforms with an extra 590 suicides between 2010 and 2013. By Rachel Charlton-Dailey, guest editor and founder of The Unwritten Disabled Britain: Doing It For Ourselves, is a week-long series across the Daily Mirror's print and digital platforms, showcasing the lives of disabled people and the issues important to us. The articles have been conceived by disabled people, written by disabled people, and photographs - where possible - taken by disabled people. Throughout this week, we aim to change your mind about how you view disabled people. After all, there are 14 million of us, and we aren\u2019t all the same, it\u2019s time the public stopped listening to lazy stereotypes and viewed disabled people in all our wide-ranging splendor. To read more on The Mirror's week-long series click here Disabled activist Ellen Clifford, author of The War on Disabled People, who provided key input into the Timeline, said it was \u201can enormously important piece of work\u201d. She said: \u201cWelfare reform has destroyed lives and caused avoidable harm on such a scale that the United Nations made a [2016] finding of grave and systematic violations of \u00addisabled people\u2019s rights. At the most extreme end this has meant the loss of life. We will probably never know the true number. \u201cThe culture of dehumanisation and hostility fostered within the DWP to justify the government\u2019s conscious cruelty has meant a complete lack of \u00adaccountability or remorse. The Timeline \u00adrepresents an important step in the continuing battle for justice for the victims of welfare reform.\u201d Work and pensions ministers have repeatedly been warned of the harm caused by the assessment system, mostly to claimants of out-of-work disability \u00adbenefits such as \u00adincapacity benefit and employment and support allowance but also the personal independence payment, which was introduced in 2013. As far back as 1995, Professor Nick Wikeley, who would later become an Upper Tribunal judge, was warning new social security legislation would \u201cleave marginal groups with \u00adinadequate protection\u201d against the risk of long-term illness. In 2006, Professor Alison Ravetz warned that if the then Labour government was wrong about its proposed incapacity benefit reforms \u201cthe cost, in stress, to those people and their families will be \u00adincalculable\u201d. Those reforms were rolled out, first under Labour and then \u2013 with even harsher restrictions \u2013 under Tory-led governments. In March 2010 came the first indication from a coroner the reforms \u2013 the work \u00adcapability \u00adassessment (WCA) and the \u00ademployment and support allowance (ESA) \u2013 were having the impact of which Ravetz had warned. Stephen Carr\u00e9, 41, had taken his life two months earlier after his appeal against being found fit for work was rejected.

      "New research by Deaths by Welfare concludes the Department for Work and Pensions failed to fix systematic flaws in the disability benefits system that potentially led to thousands of deaths You can listen to an audio version of this article here The Government\u2019s failure to act on warnings about its disability benefits systems has been linked to hundreds \u2013 maybe even \u00adthousands \u2013 of suicides and other deaths of disabled people. A detailed 160-page study published today exposes how the Department for Work and Pensions was alerted more than 40 times to life-threatening systemic flaws, by academics, coroners and its own researchers over the past 30 years. The Mirror has been given exclusive access to the Deaths by Welfare Timeline, which brings together for the first time the three decades of \u00adinvestigations linking DWP and its social security reforms with the deaths of disabled benefit claimants. It documents the DWP\u2019s \u201ccumulative harm\u201d and \u201cslow bureaucratic violence\u201d that has led to countless suicides and other deaths, particularly in the post-2010 austerity era. One piece of research connects just one area of the 2010 coalition government\u2019s welfare reforms with an extra 590 suicides between 2010 and 2013. By Rachel Charlton-Dailey, guest editor and founder of The Unwritten Disabled Britain: Doing It For Ourselves, is a week-long series across the Daily Mirror's print and digital platforms, showcasing the lives of disabled people and the issues important to us. The articles have been conceived by disabled people, written by disabled people, and photographs - where possible - taken by disabled people. Throughout this week, we aim to change your mind about how you view disabled people. After all, there are 14 million of us, and we aren\u2019t all the same, it\u2019s time the public stopped listening to lazy stereotypes and viewed disabled people in all our wide-ranging splendor. To read more on The Mirror's week-long series click here Disabled activist Ellen Clifford, author of The War on Disabled People, who provided key input into the Timeline, said it was \u201can enormously important piece of work\u201d. She said: \u201cWelfare reform has destroyed lives and caused avoidable harm on such a scale that the United Nations made a [2016] finding of grave and systematic violations of \u00addisabled people\u2019s rights. At the most extreme end this has meant the loss of life. We will probably never know the true number. \u201cThe culture of dehumanisation and hostility fostered within the DWP to justify the government\u2019s conscious cruelty has meant a complete lack of \u00adaccountability or remorse. The Timeline \u00adrepresents an important step in the continuing battle for justice for the victims of welfare reform.\u201d Work and pensions ministers have repeatedly been warned of the harm caused by the assessment system, mostly to claimants of out-of-work disability \u00adbenefits such as \u00adincapacity benefit and employment and support allowance but also the personal independence payment, which was introduced in 2013. As far back as 1995, Professor Nick Wikeley, who would later become an Upper Tribunal judge, was warning new social security legislation would \u201cleave marginal groups with \u00adinadequate protection\u201d against the risk of long-term illness. In 2006, Professor Alison Ravetz warned that if the then Labour government was wrong about its proposed incapacity benefit reforms \u201cthe cost, in stress, to those people and their families will be \u00adincalculable\u201d. Those reforms were rolled out, first under Labour and then \u2013 with even harsher restrictions \u2013 under Tory-led governments. In March 2010 came the first indication from a coroner the reforms \u2013 the work \u00adcapability \u00adassessment (WCA) and the \u00ademployment and support allowance (ESA) \u2013 were having the impact of which Ravetz had warned. Stephen Carr\u00e9, 41, had taken his life two months earlier after his appeal against being found fit for work was rejected. Coroner Tom Osborne said this \u201ctrigger\u201d led to his suicide, and urged changes to the WCA. In April 2012, Colin Traynor, 29, died following a seizure, after months of growing anxiety about his finances and being wrongly found fit for work. Five months later, Labour\u2019s Michael Meacher became one of the first MPs to speak in parliament about the controversial medical assessments. \u201cSadly, Colin was not an isolated case,\u201d he said at the time.

      "Manchester United fan Robert Davies, 33, had been partying in Blackpool and joking with family in the days and weeks leading up to his death A photo of a dad-of-two taken weeks before he took his life shows the signs aren't always clear, his family has said. Manchester United fan Robert Davies, 33, had been partying in Blackpool and joking with family in the days and weeks leading up to his death. Now his mum and sisters want others to see the pictures of an outwardly happy young man to raise awareness. Speaking to WalesOnline bereft mother Rachel said her home in Crickhowell \"feels empty\" since Robert's death. His family says support was lacking throughout his struggles and that while he received treatment for alcohol addiction they were never given a direct line for a support worker. Rachel says she's also struggled to find bereavement support and has had to resort to Facebook community groups. Robert is described as \u201cfun-loving and as mischievous as anything\u201d. The only thing the popular window cleaner adored more than football and his team Manchester United were his family and friends. But on November 30 he took his life days after enjoying a holiday in Blackpool and sharing photos of his trip with his girlfriend on social media. At home with her seven cats, three dogs, and 14-year-old daughter, Rachel points to the corner of the room beside her which is now Robert\u2019s corner. His ashes sit in the middle of ornamental robins, candles, and a small glass house which reads: \u201cSpecial son, your light will shine forever inside our broken hearts.\u201d Her lounge is crammed with pictures of him - some with his two children aged 10 and four. \u201cRobbie is here with me forever,\u201d Rachel, 52, said. \u201cI do believe that. They always say when robins appear, loved ones are near. Life is empty here now, that\u2019s how I\u2019d describe it. The only joy I get is when my grandchildren come to stay. \"How do you carry on doing normal daily things when you feel your life has come to a halt? It\u2019s just day by day, or even minute by minute sometimes.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the waking up in the morning when you forget for a second that he\u2019s not here, that\u2019s the worst part,\u201d she said. Flicking through countless photos of her son, she continued: \u201cI would genuinely say he was one of the happiest and most outgoing people for much of his life. A super-friendly person who would walk into a group of people he wouldn\u2019t know and would come out with many friends.\u201d Rachel smiles and laughs as she recalls funny memories which she now cherishes more than ever. \u201cAt his nan\u2019s birthday party only days before he died he brought out a cake for her with candles that didn\u2019t blow out. He found it hilarious watching her trying everything to get these candles to stop. That sums up the type of person he was.\u201d It also shows how anyone can find themselves at their lowest ebb within days and when their family might least expect it, she says. Even in the days prior to his death Robert\u2019s relatives said he had appeared to be as happy as he\u2019d been in a long time, and had even decided to take his girlfriend on holiday. A picture taken of Robert in Blackpool shows him the week before he took his life, and it\u2019s a picture Rachel wants others to see. Looking at the photo, she explained: \u201cBy that point I think he definitely was suffering mentally and he tried to mask it with drink. He\u2019d often drink a bottle of vodka a day which I\u2019d put water in without him knowing. But he did seem to have become better prior to his death. \u201cHe did seem to have picked himself up and then he\u2019d have a bad week where he\u2019d be really down. His friends would often say how they felt he was getting there, but maybe he was putting on a show to make people think he was okay. \u201cI want others to be aware that there are not always clear signs. The story about his nan not being able to blow the candles out was days before he died. The photos in Blackpool were taken a week before.\u201d By the time of his death Robert had worked hard to build his window cleaning business in Brecon and enjoyed speaking with locals - particularly those older than himself. \"The older folk really loved him, he\u2019d spend half the time having tea and coffee with them,\u201d Rachel went on. \u201cHe came home telling us all about them and the stories he\u2019d heard. He\u2019d often sit with them during the lockdowns to keep them company. \u201cIt does show it can happen to anyone and that\u2019s the saddest part. People don\u2019t think this will ever happen to them or to anyone they know. A year before he died he\u2019d have been the person in my life I\u2019d have worried about the least.\u201d When his mental health dipped in the spring of 2021 Robert moved back in with Rachel, and she says they spent his final months watching copious amounts of sport on the television, sometimes until the early hours of the morning, to occupy his mind. \u201cHe became my little boy again,\u201d she recalled. The night before he died Robert had fallen asleep drunk on the sofa. Rachel rang the doctors the following morning after he had told her he felt he wanted to take his life. She says she still feels guilty that she didn\u2019t call the emergency services, but she feels let down that she wasn\u2019t prepared for that moment. She claims Robert wasn\u2019t offered any support other than for his alcohol dependency, even though he\u2019d sometimes told specialists that he wanted to take his life in the months before he died. \u201cI rang the doctors and they said they\u2019d call me back, but by the time they rang me back an hour and a half later Robert was dead,\u201d Rachel said. \u201cNot only did Robert not get enough support but we as a family didn\u2019t get the support we needed. \u201cIf we\u2019d had appropriate guidance we\u2019d have known what to do when Robert told us he wanted to take his life. We were in contact with mental health specialists but we were never given a direct number to contact or guidance on what to do in that scenario. \u201cThere was no face to face support during Covid either. Everything was done over the phone - even the counselling for Robert for his problems with alcohol which he started in the March [of 2021]. He needed face to face help.\u201d On the morning of his death Robert told his mum he was planning on driving away from the house when she went to drop off her grandson at school, to which Rachel told him he couldn\u2019t because he had been drinking. \u201cWhen I came back from dropping Jaxson off I was relieved to see Robert\u2019s car still outside,\u201d she remembered. \u201cI knew he\u2019d gone to his room when I got in the house but that was normal when he was particularly down. \u201cSometimes he would go to bed and sleep the day away. I thought he was safe up there and that there was nothing up there that he could hurt himself with. \u201cI was heading up the stairs to tell him I\u2019d rang the doctors when the police knocked on the door and said they were doing a welfare check. Then I was told he\u2019d rang his ex-partner and friend to tell them he wanted to kill himself. \u201cThey finally got his door open and told me to ring an ambulance. I felt completely numb, but I honestly thought he\u2019d be okay. The paramedics and police worked on him for 40 minutes before telling me he\u2019d gone. It didn\u2019t feel real and still doesn\u2019t feel real. \u201cHow can you believe that someone who had been so full of life could be gone like that? I still think he\u2019s going to walk through the door. How do you accept that your little boy is gone?\u201d Since Robert died Rachel says specialist support has also been few and far between and she's had to seek help on Facebook. She says there are lengthy waiting lists just for an initial phone call and charities are becoming overstretched. Robert\u2019s sister Parisse said: \u201cThere\u2019s a serious lack of help for anyone these days. We need to encourage everyone, especially men, that there is no shame in speaking about your feelings. Too many young men are struggling in silence, we need to support one another.\" If you are affected by this story there are many people who would be happy to talk to you: Samaritans If you need to talk and don't know where to turn to, the Samaritans operate a free helpline open 24/7 on 116 123.

      "Police officer David Loudon left a family holiday in Wales early and killed himself and son Harrison while his wife and step-children were still away in a tragic set of events A police sergeant who was \"driven mad\" by the coronavirus lockdown gassed his three-year-old autistic son to death before killing himself. David Loudon, an officer with West Mercia police, was suffering from depression and anxiety, an inquest heard today. The bodies of the sergeant and his son Harrison were found at their Kidderminster home in August 2021 while the rest of their family were away on holiday. Mr Loudon left a suicide note for his wife saying \"she'd be better off without him\". The court heard how the boy had recently been diagnosed with suspected autism and his behaviour was \"proving challenging\". Covid and the subsequent lockdowns and restrictions had also led to Mr Loudon being unable to get the face-to-face medical attention he felt he and Harrison needed. He left the family holiday in Wales early and killed himself and Harrison while his wife and step-children were still away, Stourport Coroner's Court heard. Mr Loudon had meticulously planned the deaths and also left notes for his family and sent letters to his friends, explaining that he had decided to take his own life and the reasons why. Worcestershire Coroner, David Reid, returned conclusions that Mr Loudon had taken his own life while Harrison Loudon had been unlawfully killed. The inquest had heard how in the various letters and notes he left, he said \"he was now with Harrison and the angels in heaven\", Birmingham Live reports. The tragedy happened at the Loudon's home in Cairndhu Drive, Kidderminster, on August 13 last year. Mr Loudon's wife, Sam, who is also a West Mercia Police officer, told how they had been at a caravan park in Rhyl with her two children and also her in-laws. She told how her husband had made it clear that he \"didn't want to be there\" as he was feeling very low in his mood and also felt physically unwell. Harrison was also having frequent \"meltdowns\", the hearing was told. Three days into the holiday, it was decided that Mr Loudon would take Harrison home. In her statement read to the inquest, Mrs Loudon said she had lots of phone calls and text messages with her husband in the following days and everything seemed fine. But on the morning of August 13 she couldn't get hold of her husband on the phone. She also noticed on the camera the family had installed in Harrison's bedroom that he was in bed but hadn't changed position for several hours. \"I got a knot in my stomach - I knew something was not right,\" her statement said. \"I knew Dave was low but I had no idea that suicide was being contemplated, it was never discussed and wasn't a concern.\" She said a few months previously Mr Loudon had told her \"I think you and Harrison would be better off without me\". She said she thought he meant he was going to leave them and never for a second imagined he was planning suicide. Mrs Loudon rang the police and they forced an entry into the house and found the body of Mr Loudon and Harrison in their respective bedrooms. A post mortem examination for both of them concluded they had died of asphyxiation. The inquest had heard how Mr Loudon went to his GP the year before this happened and said he was feeling low, depressed and anxious, but not suicidal. He was prescribed anti-depressants, but didn't take them, and also had six counselling sessions which were arranged by West Mercia Police. Detective Inspector Mark Walters from West Mercia Police, who carried out an investigation into the double-death, said they were well planned. He said an examination of his phone revealed extensive searches. Several notes and letters were found. One was for his wife, Sam, in which he spoke about his fears for Harrison\u2019s future. \u201cI can\u2019t watch Harrison regress and become scared and confused with the world around him. I can\u2019t let that destroy us, the pressure and my diseased mind won out I couldn\u2019t see that this would get anything than worse.\" He also wrote: \"The only way is to die, I couldn\u2019t leave you with Harrison, it would be too much. I did it out of love and desperation.\u201d In her most recent statement, which was read out to the inquest, Mrs Loudon said: \"I felt devastated that he didn\u2019t tell me how he was feeling - he had lost hope in everything. \"I loved him very much but it was an unforgivable decision, I wished he had told me. I will never be able to forgive David for taking the life of our little boy Harrison - he had no right to take my son\u2019s life, regardless of how he was feeling.\u201d The Samaritans is available 24/7 if you need to talk.

      "David Marsden, 22, was said to 'light up the darkest rooms' by his sister but the young man tragically took his own life after struggling with insomnia which began when a family holiday was cut short A young man who \"lit up the darkest rooms\" took his own life after he fell into a \"mental health spiral\" during struggles with insomnia. David Marsden first began suffering with the condition when a family holiday in 2019 was cut short. But following that the 22-year-old fell into a \u201cvicious cycle\u201d of becoming increasingly anxious at his normal life slipping away as his insomnia took over, the Manchester Evening News reports. The lab worker at Stepping Hill hospital suffered episodes of depression and anxiety and spent time on a psychiatric ward in the hospital where he worked. However, on November 21, 2019, months after the family holiday that was cut short, he was found dead in his family home in Stockport. His death triggered PTSD and insomnia in his older sister Charlene Marsden who has since opened up about his death. David's death turned the world of his sister, 33-year-old Charlene Marsden, and she said they had been \u201clike twins\u201d. She continued: \"We shared the same interests, the gym, Game of Thrones, all sorts of things. We would literally do everything together, and watch all the shows and movies together. He was literally my best friend. \"He was loved by so many people. And it's sad because my brother was the person who all his friends, family, and colleagues, including myself, would go to for advice and help when we were feeling low. \u201cHe knew exactly what to say. His smile would light up the darkest of rooms, but unfortunately, when he found himself in a dark place there was just no way of getting him out of it. \"I don't think there's a lot of awareness of sibling grief and what it does to you,\" Charlene added. She said: \"They are the ones you think will be there when your parents pass. They are your past, your present, and your future so when you lose them at such a young age it's just so tragic and upsetting. \"I think I'll be dealing with this for the rest of my life. I probably cry most days about him to be fair. \u201cThere will always be something that will remind you and you'll suddenly be in tears. But it's something I guess you learn to live with as hard as that sounds. You carry it around with you, and after a while, it gets lighter, but it's always there.\" Charlene struggled so much that she said she suffered from PTSD and her own bout of insomnia. She said: \"Last year before the inquest it happened to me. I can't even put into words what it was like. But I understood completely what he must have been going through. \"I had to have three months off work as my mum was terrified it was going to happen to me. I think it was just to do with the grief and the mental issues it had caused. I went three weeks without sleeping. It was horrendous. \"Once you get up having not slept all night you become terrified of the evening that's coming next because you think 'am I going to lie there awake all night again.' Your appetite completely goes and you feel sick. You're running on empty, you're like a zombie. \"I had hypnotherapy, counselling, the lot. But I'm just pushing through as for me it's like I owe it to my brother. Just to show him that I can do it. \"Obviously it destroyed my brother and I'm not going to let it destroy me. I'm proving it to him, that it doesn't matter how bad things get, you can push through it.\" Charlene and her and David\u2019s mum, Fiona Marsden, have set up a local support group for those bereaved by suicide. They hold monthly meetings and have now decided they are all going to climb Snowdon to raise funds for four charities close to their hearts. David\u2019s much-loved niece 13-year-old Chantae is also taking part and his cousin Adrian, a former Royal Marine, is acting as a guide and support during the climb. Charlene said: \"We just want to spread awareness and raise as much as we can for these charities and I think that funding is vital at the minute as demand has gone up massively and there just isn't enough funding there. \"The climb will be a challenge but also really symbolic as I'm still climbing a mountain with my grief. But I truly believe it's helping. That's why it means so much to all of us.\" Charlene intends to sprinkle some of her brother's ashes at the summit. \"I know the views will be beautiful and he loved nature,\" she said. \"I am in awe of all the members. I'm in my thirties but several of them are older and have health issues. But we'll just take it at the pace of the slowest climber and if we reach the top we've done our bit for those who need our help the most. \"With mental health being paramount I go through life now with the motto 'in a world where you can be anything, be kind.'

      "Pictures of Steffan Rees are not what people expect to see after he took his own life. They show pure joy and happiness as he teaches his baby niece a joyful song The final images of a man before his life ended are what his family want everyone to see. Pictures of Steffan Rees are not what people expect to see after he took his own life. They show pure joy and happiness as he teaches his baby niece \"If You Are Happy And You Know It\". Stefan's sister Sian, from Cardigan, Wales, says her brother was the \"life and soul of the party\" and the kind of person who \"lit up the room\" when he arrived. Wales On line reports it is why his suicide was such a shock and drives his devastated sister to help others. She said: \"I couldn't have asked for a better brother. \"He was only 26, had a loving family, a beautiful girlfriend, and didn't say anything about having any mental health issues.\" Since his death Sian has tried to find positives. Together with widows Lisa and Ana, who have also been bereaved through suicide, they have set up a support group and taken part in a UK awareness campaign. New research from suicide prevention charity Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) has found that 61% of people would struggle to tell if someone they knew felt suicidal. The charity wants to raise awareness that the \u2018face of suicide\u2019 isn\u2019t always crying and being recluse. A person might seem happy on the outside, and to illustrate this, the charity has unveiled an exhibition on London\u2019s Southbank called 'The Last Photo'. The outdoor gallery displays 50 smiling photos taken in the last days of people who died by suicide. It also shares the stories of shock and grief their families and friends experienced. A photograph of Steffan forms part of the moving exhibition, as do the pictures of Peter Hammett, from Swansea, and Lee, from Tenby. Along with Sian, Peter's wife Lisa and Lee's wife Ana have set up a support group - LISS - Living in Suicide Shadow because they felt there was a lack of support for those bereaved by suicide. Ana said: \"We are a peer-to-peer support group that aims to break the 'isolation' that we often find ourselves in by organising face to face and virtual meet ups, walks, family activities with people that understand the pain of suicide.\" The latest figures show that 125 people die by suicide every week in the UK, but it can be hard to spot the signs something isn\u2019t okay Just months after Ana's husband died of suicide another CALM's project called 84, which represented the number of people who died every week in the UK in 2018, was launched. Ana, whose children were nine and six when her husband died, said: \"The 84 project floored me. \"It had such a powerful message; I couldn't believe 84 men took their lives every week\u2026 so many families, friends, and communities heartbroken. \"Suddenly, my husband's individual act was not so individual anymore. \"If the suicide average was constant, how can we blame such rates of suicide on one individual's reckless decision? \"It felt much more like a social issue, and if it was the case, then we could do something about it.\" Talking about this campaign she said: \"I will never forget those beautiful smiles of those beautiful people\u2026 beautiful children, beautiful women, handsome men, different ages, different genders, different social classes, different ethnicities, proof that suicide can happen to anyone. \"The shadows of the leaves moving with the wind and the sun created movement in the photos. I kept looking and hoping that they would start moving. \"And even though it was so comforting to see a life-size picture, I found it so hard to leave the exhibition; I wanted to bring him home with me, we miss Lee so much!\" The picture of Lee, who was 41 when he died, was taken in Castell Henllys, Pembrokeshire, on a \"wonderful\" day out with friends. \"There were Roman attacks, and Celtic victories, plenty of laughter and at one point Lee had all the kids shoeless crossing the stream in the cold April. \"Never in a million years would any of us believe that he would be gone less than a couple of months later. \"Our children were only six and nine when he died. He loved them to bits and was always with them. They would say 'but daddy was always happy with he was with me'.\" It was not long after Lee's death that Ana met Lisa, through Dr Dai Lloyd, an MS who has been heavily involved in suicide prevention campaigns. Ana added: \"Things have moved on a lot in recent years, but there is a lot of stigma around suicide. \"People would say things like he is your husband, you live with him, how did you not see it, some people blame you for it, others don't know what to say. \"It is said that we lose around 70% of our circle of family and friends as it is difficult for people to understand and support our grief. Being able to talk with other people who have been through the same experience has helped. The group has helped the three form a close bond. \"We have been on a journey together the last couple of years and it seemed fitting that we should all be taking part in The Last Photo campaign and supporting each other,\" she said. \"The exhibition was held on the Southbank somewhere I'd previously visited with my family including Peter with such happy memories. \"My immediate reaction when I saw the life size photo of Peter was to cry. \"I placed my hand upon his face in disbelief remembering this photo I had taken on our 33rd wedding anniversary just three months before he died.

      "Richard Farquhar, 61 - who murdered his wife in a jealous rage over an affair - took his own life after his release from prison was stalled and he was suspended from his charity shop job A murderer who killed his wife after discovering she was having an affair later took his own life in jail. Richard Farquhar became depressed about the possibility of delaying his release and after losing his prison placement at a charity shop. The 61-year-old was being held in HMP Greenock, in Inverclyde, Scotland, and, nearing the end of his sentence, had been moved to less restrictive procedures, including being given the new job. But he was suspended after his placement supervisor began to feel \u201cincreasingly uncomfortable\u201d, according to a sheriff's report. Farquhar's mental health started to deteriorate after prison chiefs stopped moves to prepare him for release. A fatal accident inquiry was held virtually at the town\u2019s sheriff court, with submissions made in February. Sheriff Andrew McIntyre issued a judgement in relation to the inmate's death on March 14, 2019. The determination was published earlier this month. Mr McIntyre said Farquhar died at 1am at Inverclyde Royal Hospital \"as a result of an injury sustained within a cell\" between 3.30pm and 4pm on March 13. \"Mr Farquhar\u2019s death did not result from an accident,\" he added. The killer was sentenced to life with a minimum of 12 years for the murder of wife Anne in 2008 on the A90 road near Aberdeen, Scotland. The High Court in Edinburgh heard how she had kicked him out of their home in Cove Bay, Aberdeenshire, after she discovered he was having an affair with her friend. Anne then began seeing the same woman's husband and Farquhar stabbed her to death. Mr McIntyre said officials failed to provide him with detailed plans on what he needed to do to work towards his release or on how to access sessions with a psychologist. He concluded that if these actions had been taken the inmate's death may have been avoided. He said: \"I have found that Mr Farquhar committed suicide following a decline in his mental health contributed to by his suspension from a community placement. \"I have found that in the days and weeks prior to his death his imminent risk of suicide could not have been detected. \"I have also found that, as a result of the systems of working in place within HMP Greenock, and as a result of certain other factors, opportunities to safeguard Mr Farquhar\u2019s mental wellbeing in the period before his death were missed. \"In particular I have found that: delay, a lack of joined-up working, and insufficient communication with Mr Farquhar, all contributed to him becoming distressed by his lack of progress, and to opportunities to avert that distress being missed.

      "Nine family members have been found dead after a suspected suicide pact due to financial problems. They have been described as \"caring and animal loving\" by locals A 15-year-old girl was among nine members of a \"caring and animal loving\" family who have been found dead in what appears to have been a suicide pact over financial debts. The bodies were found in two separate houses that belonged to two brothers from the family in the Sangli district of Maharashtra, India. Only two cats remain alive at one of the homes with the family described as \"caring and animal loving\" by locals with a vet, Dr Manik Vanmore, among the dead. Police believe that the nine people died after consuming poison and that the family was going through financial problems, reported Indian Express. Suicide notes refer to \"repeated and public\" harassment that the family suffered from money lenders which was both \"mental and physical\", it is reported. The ages of the family range from a girl aged 15, to a 72-year-old woman. The brothers have been named as Popat Yallapa Vanmore, 52, and Dr Manik Yallapa Vanmore, 49. The seven other bodies were identified as Sangeeta Popat Vanmore, 48, Archana Popat Vanmore, 30, Shubham Popat Vanmore, 28, Rekha Manik Vanmore, 45, Aditya Manik Vanmore, 15, Anita Manik Vanmore, 28, and Akkatai Vanmore, 72. Footage taken at the scene shows the corpses lying inside rooms. They were found by locals who noticed the front doors had not been opened for some time. Sangli's District Superintendent of Police Dixit Kumar Gedam said: \u201cNine dead bodies have been recovered in Mhaisal village of Sangli district, out of which three bodies have been recovered from one house and six dead bodies from the other house. \"The forensic team is present on the spot.\u201d A police investigation is currently under way, with officers registering an unnatural cause of death. The bodies will be sent for autopsies. Fifteen people from the region, who have allegedly lent money to the brothers, have been arrested and the police are searching for 10 more suspects, reported Indian Express. A family friend Ashwini Sawant said that they were a \"caring\" family. \u201cI literally grew up in their home,\u201d he said, \u201cAll of them were very caring and considered me as one of them. From all the special dishes cooked at their home to all the major events, I have been there.

      "Brian Temple's mum described her son as \"happy go lucky\" but said the ordeal of incorrectly naming him as a paedophile caused him to become closed off and depressed An inquest heard how a man took his own life after police wrongly named him as a paedophile as a result of \"human error\". Brian Temple was just 34-years-old when he died on December 31, 2017 - six months after being arrested on June 8 for allegedly stealing a pack of sausage rolls from Greggs. The inquest opened on Monday, June 20, and it heard that upon arriving home from custody, Mr Temple gave his release papers to his then-girlfriend, TeessideLive reports. Unbeknown to him, police had made an error in which they produced the wrong information on this document. The letter said he been in custody for inciting sexual relations with a 13-year-old girl, which he had not. Teesside Coroner's Court heard that Mr Temple's then-girlfriend began telling people of the incorrect information, which in turn caused people to lash out at the Redcar man. He was reportedly verbally abused in the street, attacked in his own home and hit around the head by a golf club. To deal with the onslaught he had experienced, the court heard Mr Temple began to drink heavily and take a mixture of both prescribed medication and recreational drugs, such as cocaine. Coroner Claire Bailey explained that a toxicology report carried out by Dr Cooper found Brian had 134mg of alcohol in his system. He was also found with a mixture of cocaine, Diazepam, Zopiclone and Pregablin - but these did not contribute to his death. Dr Cooper concluded that Mr Temple's death was as a result of hanging. His body was found by his brother Anthony, after his mum's partner, Paul Daley, became concerned that they had not heard from him all day. Coroner officer Nick Owen read statements from Mr Temple's brother Paul, sister in law Crystal and mum Mrs McLachlan, who has since passed away. His mum described her son as \"happy go lucky\" but admitted the ordeal with incorrect release papers caused him to become closed off and depressed. The court heard that after news spread of the release papers, Mr Temple reported threats and assaults to the police. The force's welfare checks reportedly made this worse and somewhat fuelled the fire of the incorrect rumours. His brother Paul, who was in attendance at the inquest at Teesside Magistrates Court, spoke of his closeness to his brother and how they'd grown up being \"anti-drug\". Paul explained Mr Temple began taking drugs to cope with the constant attacks and assaults he was experiencing in the months leasing to his passing. Although he had depression, Paul said his brother never indicated suicidal tendencies and said the mistake on the release sheet \"would drive anyone mad\". What crimes have been reported in your neighbourhood? Check with In Your Area. In her statement, Mr Temple's sister-in-law Crystal said the mistaken charge sheet was found in his pocket at the time of his death. She said she believed the police had a \"duty of care\" for vulnerable people such as her brother-in-law, as he was suffering from mental health issues at the time of his arrest. Officer Owen read out numerous statements from police officers who had dealt with Mr Temple in the run up to his death and around the time of his arrest and the incorrect papers being issued. Detective Sergeant Agar of Cleveland Police said in his statement that he had dealt with Mr Temple's complaint of the incorrect papers on November 28, 2017, and had said the bail sheet was \"a genuine human error\". The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) began an investigation after Mr Temple's passing, so an error like this one would never happen again at Cleveland Police. They concluded that human error was the main judgement of the papers and this occurrence was \"incredibly unusual\". The inquest continues. The Samaritans is available 24/7 if you need to talk.

      "Silvija Snipkute, 31, who was a mum-of-one and had five siblings., was described as the \"strongest person\" but tragically took her own life after she booked into a hotel room in London A \u201cloving\u201d young mum was found dead in her hotel room after staff noticed she hadn\u2019t checked out. Silvija Snipkute was discovered dead by cleaning staff at the Bank Hotel in Barking, after she failed to check out that morning. An inquest heard how she tragically took her own life. After they noticed the 31-year-old\u2019s door was locked, staff retrieved a key - but sadlt they found the young mum dead inside, around 11:30am on February 15, My London reported . Medics from the London Ambulance Service declared her dead at the scene. Met Police officers also attended the scene and were informed she had arrived the previous evening and was due to leave that morning. However, the mum had been reported missing when her partner Tomas notified police that she had failed to return home. An inquest heard how the mum had taken herself to a private space where she wouldn\u2019t be interrupted to take her own life. An examination of CCTV showed that nobody else had entered her hotel room since she arrived at 9:49pm and her death was deemed non-suspicious. An inquest at Waltham Forest Coroners Court on June 6 heard that shortly after Silvija was discovered, officers were made aware \u201cthat the woman in the room was identical to a woman who had been reported missing\u201d. A \u201cvery sad note\u201d was found in her hotel room which Coroner Graeme Irvine said was a \u201cnote of intent\u201d indicating that she had intended to take her own life. What is happening where you live? Find out by adding your postcode. A post-mortem examination found that Silvija, a warehouse operative from Dagenham, had no natural diseases, whilst a toxicology report found traces of alcohol and cocaine in her blood and urine.

      "Suzanne Drinkwater woke up in summer last year to find her boyfriend dead in the bed beside her and she decided to take her own life- the couple's bodies would eventually be found there A woman tragically killed herself after waking up to find her boyfriend dead in their bed beside her. Suzanne Drinkwater woke up one morning in the summer last year and was horrified when she found her boyfriend 35-year-old Gavin Massey, was dead next to her. The heartbroken 32-year-old from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, took her own life that morning in the very same bed. When the couple were finally found after police bashed down their front door, one of the bodies was decomposing. She had been receiving help for a number of psychiatric conditions at the time of her death, the inquest into their deaths heard. Coroner Tom Osborne, sitting at Milton Keynes, heard how Gavin likely died from cardiomegaly, an enlarged heart, and left ventricular hypertrophy, worsened by the steroids he had been taking. His death was also exacerbated by a mixture of alcohol and drugs found in his system. The alarm was raised after Suzanne\u2019s sister had been unable to contact her from August 4, and on August 7, she raised her fears with police. One day after that, they discovered the couple dead after police were forced to break into their home. There was no criticism of the agencies which had been helping both patients, during the joint inquest. The Samaritans is available 24/7 if you need to talk.

      "Murder victim Stephen Cameron's dad Kenneth Cameron, who had been fighting depression since his wife Toni passed away, took his own life just hours after his dog died The dad of a man stabbed to death by road-rage gangster Kenneth Noye killed himself just hours after his dog died, an inquest has found. Kenneth Cameron, 75, grief-stricken by the murder of Stephen, 21, and the death of wife Toni, 73, downed paracetamol and whisky. The overdose was triggered by the death of his dog. Mr Cameron\u2019s brother, Gary, had spoken to him on the night the pet died. But 24 hours later Gary found Mr Cameron, who lived alone, on the floor of his retirement home flat. He died on March 15 in hospital in Ashford, Kent. A coroner said Mr Cameron had been racked with depression since the 2016 death of retired nurse Toni. He was also haunted by the 2019 release of Noye, 75, 19 years into a life sentence for murdering Stephen on a M25 sliproad in Swanley, Kent. Recording a verdict of suicide, coroner Katrina Hepburn said: \u201cMr Cameron\u2019s mental health had been deteriorating since the death of his wife. He had been particularly hit by the death of his dog. When his brother went to see him he was found unconscious in his flat.\u201d Mr Cameron suffered a \u201ccardiac shock\u201d and had been diagnosed with heart disease, asthma and prostate cancer, the inquest heard. He had a heart attack in 2017 and said he was \u201cupset that he had survived\u201d it. In a statement to the inquest, consultant Dr Debkuma Pandit said he gathered Mr Cameron\u2019s family together as his condition worsened. Dr Pandit said: \u201cHis family mentioned that he was depressed for many years and that the death of his dog was the trigger for his suicide attempt.\u201d Toni died in 2016 after catching her arm on a bush in the garden and contracting a superbug. Her ashes were interred at Stephen\u2019s grave. Ken said: \u201cThey were so close in life that it seemed right to put them together in death.\u201d The couple had campaigned to keep their son\u2019s killer behind bars. Noye became Britain\u2019s most wanted man when he went on the run after the 1996 murder. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox. Sign up for the free Mirror newsletter It sparked an international manhunt and he was arrested two years later when Stephen\u2019s fiancee, Danielle Cable, helped identify Noye in a Spanish restaurant. In 2020 he was seen at the spot where he stabbed Stephen. Mr Cameron said: \u201cIt\u2019s like Noye\u2019s walking on Stephen\u2019s grave. I feel sickened he has gone back to the place where he took my son\u2019s life.\u201d Noye previously served a 14-year sentence for handling gold bullion from the \u00a326.3million Brink\u2019s-Mat robbery in 1983. Danielle, who was just 17 at the time of the murder, is still under the witness protection scheme. The Samaritans is available 24/7 if you need to talk.

      "Mental health campaigner Trevor Coult has shared his devastation at losing Pete Carson who served in the Royal Irish Regiment with Trevor in Afghanistan and was found dead in a suspected suicide A decorated war hero is mourning his 13th \u00adcomrade lost to the armed forces mental health crisis. Campaigner Trevor Coult, who won the Military Cross for service in Iraq, was devastated to learn last week of the latest death. Pete Carson, who served in the Royal Irish Regiment with Trevor in Afghanistan, was found dead in a suspected suicide. Anguished Trevor, 47, said: \u201cIn any other profession there would be calls for a major inquiry \u2013 but it seems the Government doesn\u2019t mind if those who served their country kill themselves.\u201d He added: \u201cI was absolutely devastated to learn that Pete had died. \"That\u2019s at least six people from my old regiment who have died and at least 13 people who I knew or served with have now taken their own lives. \u201cThere have been more deaths. I don\u2019t think there is any job in the country where someone would know so many people who have taken their own lives.\u201d The 12 others who Trevor knew include fellow Afghan vet Brett Savage, 32, who had taken part in a documentary in which he said the Ministry of Defence was not doing enough to help. Before he died he spoke about combat in Afghanistan and said: \u201cMy unit was under fire for 55 days. \"It was non-stop. I saw good men killed. We lost four in total. \u201cI was blown up with an RPG and lost the hearing in my right ear. \"I was also shot in the chest, the body armour saved my life. \"I went crazy. I was on drugs, drinking all the time.\u201d Shortly after Brett\u2019s death, Sgt Fraser Stirling, also a member of the Royal Irish Regiment and a one-time colleague of Trevor\u2019s, took his own life aged 30. The other tragedies include Northern Ireland veteran Deane Hart, 53, and Capt Gary Case, a veteran of Iraq, who died weeks after being awarded an MBE. Capt Case, 50, had gained \u00adpromotion from the ranks and was one of the most popular officers in the Rifles regiment. Another of those who died was Jamie Davis, also a former member of the Rifles. The 30-year-old dad-of-two hanged himself in January 2020. He had previously suffered shrapnel wounds and witnessed the deaths of colleagues in both Iraq and Afghanistan. His widow Alicia said he had \u201cnightmares night and day\u201d and was ashamed of his condition. She added: \u201cHe was screaming in the middle of the night. He was riddled with guilt. \"One of his best mates got killed and he said that should have been him.\u201d The other soldiers and veterans in confirmed or suspected suicides are Danny Johnston, 35, Mitchell Matthews, 24, James Ross, 30, Paul Cochrane, 18, Eddie Murphy, 50, Andy McFarland, 32 and Paul Brennan. Dad of one Trevor, from Suffolk, added: \u201cThe MoD says that the deaths have nothing in common and there isn\u2019t a problem with suicide. \"All of those who died had mental health issues, they had all seen combat and they all served in the armed forces \u2013 that\u2019s what they had in common.\u201d Since 2017 at least 350 veterans and service personnel are believed to have taken their own lives. At least 22 have died from suspected suicides so far this year. The vast majority had seen combat.

      "Police in the US believe prisoner Casey White \"wasn't smart enough\" to plan the breakout and said \"exemplary employee\" Vicky White was in the perfect position to organise it all A prison guard who took her own life after being on the run with a murderer for 11 days was the mastermind behind the the whole plan, police believe. Hulking 6ft9 prisoner Casey White - alleged to have been officer Vicky White's lover - \"wasn't smart enough to plan it all,\" according to Lauderdale County Sheriff Rick Singleton. In an interview with CNN, Singleton said 56-year-old Vicky - who he described as an \"exemplary employee\" - was \"in a position\" to coordinate the jailbreak, organising a van in the morning and ensuring all the armed deputies were not in the building. \"She knew that the booking officer wasn\u2019t going to question her, the assistant director, when she told her that she was going to take him to court and drop him off with other employees,\" Singleton told the network. Not long before she died by suicide, Vicky seemed to be angry at Casey, 38, for deciding to stay at a motel. Some of her last words were recorded by police as officers rammed into the pair's Cadillac into a ditch after a dramatic chase. She's heard saying: \u201cAirbags are going off. Let\u2019s get out and run.\u201d And then: \u201cYou had to stay in some f****** motel.\u201d Vicky, who had made up a bogus medical appointment for the felon on April 29, shot herself moments later. Singleton said wigs, weapons including an AR-15 rifle, a 9mm handgun and $29,000 worth of cash had also been found. He said Vicky had sold her house to raise the funds. She would have been facing up to 10 years in prison for helping Casey escape. Singleton said Vicky, formerly second command at Alabama's Lauderdale County Jail, was a much liked, respected employee who other staff viewed as a \"mother figure\". She was even about to be awarded Employee of the Year for the fifth time. \"What in the world provoked her, or prompted her, to pull something like this, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll ever know,\" he said. \"I had every bit of trust in Vicky White. She had been an exemplary employee.\" Casey appeared before a judge in Alabama on Tuesday night charged with escaping prison. Previously Vanderburgh County Sheriff Dave Wedding said that because a large number of guns were found inside the car, if Vicky and Casey they had not been rammed off the road the day could have ended with more bloodshed. He told reporters: \u201cWe later found out that [if they hadn\u2019t rammed the vehicle], the fugitive was going to engage in a shootout with law enforcement. \u201cThat action may have saved many of my deputies and fellow law enforcement officers\u2019 lives.\u201d The couple, who were not related, are said to have been in a \u201cjailhouse romance\u201d for around two years. Their dramatic escape came on the eve of Vicky\u2019s retirement as a correctional officer. Since their 2020 meeting, Vicky had regularly been driving the two hours to where Casey was incarcerated, at the William E Donaldson Correctional Facility. She gave a false name to prison authorities. Get email updates with the day's biggest stories ",

Singleton said Vicky, formerly second command at Alabama's Lauderdale County Jail, was a much liked, respected employee who other staff viewed as a \"mother figure\". She was even about to be awarded Employee of the Year for the fifth time. \"What in the world provoked her, or prompted her, to pull something like this, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll ever know,\" he said. \"I had every bit of trust in Vicky White. She had been an exemplary employee.\" Casey appeared before a judge in Alabama on Tuesday night charged with escaping prison. Previously Vanderburgh County Sheriff Dave Wedding said that because a large number of guns were found inside the car, if Vicky and Casey they had not been rammed off the road the day could have ended with more bloodshed. He told reporters: \u201cWe later found out that [if they hadn\u2019t rammed the vehicle], the fugitive was going to engage in a shootout with law enforcement. \u201cThat action may have saved many of my deputies and fellow law enforcement officers\u2019 lives.\u201d The couple, who were not related, are said to have been in a \u201cjailhouse romance\u201d for around two years. Their dramatic escape came on the eve of Vicky\u2019s retirement as a correctional officer. Since their 2020 meeting, Vicky had regularly been driving the two hours to where Casey was incarcerated, at the William E Donaldson Correctional Facility. She gave a false name to prison authorities. Get email updates with the day's biggest stories ",

Young Layth Maumoniat, a year even at Allerton High School, was said to have been 'emotional and screaming' before he was found dead by his older sister. Grieving dad Ali Maumoniat told LeedsLive : \"We've lost him and we feel empty. \"He was the funniest lad and the personality in our household.\" He added: \"He was so emotional and an hour later his sister came running and was screaming and he was found dead. \"Allah gave me my beautiful boy Layth 12 years ago but sadly I today have to return him back to his Lord where he'll be with the rest of the angels and reunited with his mum.\" In 2020, at just 10 years old, Layth lost his mum to suicide and often struggled after his mother's death, Ali said. \"I just cannot imagine what was going through his head at that moment. I think all he was thinking was that he'll be back with his mum,\" he said. \"May the angels lift you in their wings and take you to the highest paradise my beautiful little lion.\" On April 30, days after the schoolboy's death, a balloon release, organised by his friends from school, happened in Alwoodley, Leeds.

Ali and family held a funeral for Laythe on Wednesday (May 4) at Leeds Grand Mosque in Woodsley Road, Hyde Park. His dad said: \"It was a beautiful turnout. Everyone was there from kids to parents and non-Muslim and Muslim families. \"Everyone was very respectful at the Grand Mosque where the prayers were given to Layth.\" The news also brought sadness to hundreds of people across Leeds.

      "Chris Lam died on April 7 after suffering from with depression since the Hilllsborough disaster in 1989 and had spent his life campaigning \"tirelessly for justice\" A daughter has paid tribute to her \"best friend\" dad who died at the age of 52 after suffering depression since surviving the Hilllsborough tragedy. Chris Lam died on April 7 this year having spent his life campaigning \"tirelessly for justice\" having survived the 1989 Hilllsborough disaster that claimed the lives of 97 people. His daughter Rebecca said he struggled with the tragedy since then. Rebecca told the Liverpool Echo : \"He was a Hillsborough survivor, he's struggled a lot since then, and always struggled in April in the lead up to the anniversary. She said: \"We knew he was struggling but we've all said none of us expected he would have done anything like this.\" Paying tribute to her dad, Rebecca said he was a \"well known\" and \"genuine\" man, who was part of Widnes Running Club where he was known by the nickname \"Mr Widnes\". Rebecca added: \"He was genuine, he was full of life, always willing to give a hand to anybody. He was there for anybody to have a chat. \"He was like my best friend, we just bounced off each other. We kept each other going, he's always been my rock. \"He was so well known we couldn't go anywhere without him bumping into somebody that he knew.\" She has now set up a Gofundme page to raise money for the Hillsborough Survivors Support Alliance, who provided counselling to her dad, and Amparo, a charity that offers support to anyone affected by suicide. On the page she says: \"Chris was a wonderful man who brought happiness wherever he went. He was warm, kind, generous, funny, a sportsman, a supporter, a friend to many, a loved one and a doting father. \"He was also a massive Liverpool FC supporter and a Hillsborough survivor.

      "Ellen Martin, 25, from Surrey, said her life changed in a split second when she was diagnosed with \"the suicide disease\" which is so painful people often turn to suicide A footballer has described her daily \"living hell\" in which she feels she like she is \"being burned alive\" after a doctor diagnosed her with a horrifying disease. Ellen Martin, 25, from Surrey has played for women's teams including Aston Villa and Fulham, but after sustaining a knee injury while playing in November last year, her world was turned upside down. Six weeks after her operation to repair the torn ligaments, the sports coach noticed her leg would go from burning hot to ice cold and went back to her surgeon for answers. But Ellen was horrified when doctors told her \"you've been diagnosed with the Suicide Disease.\" The disease, which affects the central nervous system, causes indescribable pain and is usually brought on through trauma or injury. Medically known as Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS), the condition is nicknamed \"the suicide disease\" due to the number of people who would rather die than live with the pain. Ellen said: \"Instantly I turned to google to find out what CRPS was... and the result was the worst possible outcome I could have read. \"I immediately broke down, crying and screaming in tears. \"I feel like my body is being burnt alive. \"Imagine feeling like your body is being set on fire while being electrocuted. \"I just want my life back.\" Before the injury, Ellen had played for multiple football teams and enjoyed a healthy active social life. But now she claims her life has been put on pause, with doctors warning that the degenerative disease will slowly rob her of her functions and mobility as the pain worsens. She said: \"The McGill Pain Index, a scale rating of pain developed by McGill University, rates CRPS as the top pain humans can experience ahead of childbirth and amputation without anaesthesia. It is a living hell. \"My life has spiralled downwards from a split-second tackle in a football match. I have been unable to walk freely, sit in a chair normally, socialise with friends and family or work. My whole life has paused. \"The daunting reality of life with CRPS is isolating, terrifying and debilitating. My doctor hadn't even heard of the condition and believed the pain was 'inside my head'. \"I am already dosed up on medications that cause 'brain fog' and severe side effect on top of my CRPS pain.\" But despite the terrifying diagnosis Ellen says there is \"a glimmer of hope\". After countless hours of research, the young footballer has found a clinic in the US giving hope to CRPS patients. Ellen has launched a GoFundMe to raise \u00a330,000 to get her to The Spero Clinic in Arkansas, US for a 12 week intensive course which will treat her pain using holistic remedies. She said: \"I have found a glimmer of hope that I can return to the wonderful life I lived before my injury and diagnosis. \"I understand, just like myself, many may believe this is 'too good to be true', and naturally, I had these reservations, but when you're faced with the horrific reality of life with CRPS... going to this clinic will be the best thing I ever do. \"I have since spoken with numerous patients who have attended the clinic who are now in remission and honestly now believe it is the place I need to be. \"So please, if you can, help me on my journey to remission from CRPS. I will be forever grateful. It's impossible to articulate or put into words what the last five months have been like, so the thought of deteriorating further is truly terrifying.\" Get email updates with the day's biggest stories ",

      "Retired police officer and dad-of-three Haydn Morgan said his beloved daughter Bronwen, 26, suffered a \"devastating injustice\" in relation to her mental health care while she trained to be a psychiatric nurse at Cardiff University Parents who camped outside their beloved daughter's room to stop her harming herself have shared their heartbreak after she tragically took her own life. Haydn Morgan and his wife Jayne took it in turns to sleep on a camper bed against the door of their 26-year-old daughteer Bronwen's room so she wouldn't escape, self-harm or take her own life. Dad-of-three Haydn said his daughter - who was studying to be a mental health nurse at Cardiff University - \"didn't like it\", but they \"couldn't let her out of our sight\" because of the risk she posed to herself. He added: \"It was the only way we could keep her safe. Haydn - who says his daughter suffered a \"devastating injustice in her care\" - said he and his wife fought for Bronwen to be admitted to a psychiatric war but it was \"always refused\". He said: \"We just didn't know where to turn.\" It had all been so different just a few years earlier. Growing up Bronwen Morgan was a talented swimmer, played the piano and was a popular Girl Guide. She also loved working with children and had a natural way of connecting with them. Before long she found herself a job in the behavioural unit at her old primary school where she earned the nickname \"Bomb-proof Bron\" as she was always calm and in control under pressure. But during her time in Cardiff University, where she was training to become a mental health nurse, her own bouts of anxiety and depression intensified and she developed an eating disorder. Her problems were further exacerbated by the pandemic when the usual activities she needed to manage her mental health disappeared virtually overnight. This coincided with the services of her community psychiatric nurse (CPN) being taken away without warning. Haydn, a dad-of-three, added that Bronwen would frequently be detained by police under the Mental Health Act and sent to Hafan Y Coed, a specialist psychiatric unit on the grounds of University Hospital Llandough. However he claims she would often be discharged from the unit without the family knowing which led to her going missing. \"Bronwen began to feel helpless and isolated which meant her mental health spiralled out of control and left her in a place that she felt she could not find a way back from,\" added Haydn, from Cyncoed, Cardiff. After many months of pain and trauma, Bronwen was allegedly told by medical staff that if she were to find herself in a crisis in the future, the police would arrest her. This decision, her family claims, was the final straw. Haydn, a retired police officer, admitted that he has struggled to shake the memory of the last day he saw Bronwen alive. He recalled: \"That week she was happy, smiling and in a really good place. We hadn't seen her like that for ages. Unbeknown to us she had this plan to take her own life. In a way she was saying goodbye to us, but nobody knew. \"She had been trying to do it for a long time. We've been told she was probably feeling a sense of elation and a sense of knowing that 'I'm going to take my life and my family will be able to get on with their lives'.\" Bronwen was found unresponsive at a hotel in Cardiff and died on Thursday, August 27, 2020. As well as writing to Cardiff and Vale University Health Board in a last-ditch cry for help, she penned a letter to her mum, dad and two younger sisters, Tesni and Cerys. \"She said she wanted us to know that she had the best childhood ever and that we'd done nothing wrong. It was just heartbreaking,\" added Haydn. \"We had literally lost all hope. We couldn't find a way of going forward and her mental health team had locked her in this cocoon and insisted that this was the therapy she should be having.\" Haydn, who is now seeing a therapist himself, added: \"Now I'm retired, you see photographs of her around the house all the time and it brings it all back. I've been miserable, tired and angry - I think we all have.\" Her heartbroken family claims that if they had been given more of a say in her care - which would have led to a more tailored and bespoke approach - she could still be alive today. They said Bronwen experienced \"a devastating injustice in her care\" and was treated with a \"blanket approach\" which had little effect on improving her mental health. Since the tragedy, Bronwen's family have set up Bronwen's Wish, a charity which aims to provide \"safe spaces\" for young people experiencing challenges with their mental health. It aims to provide wellbeing pods in primary and secondary schools which will act as \"quiet, relaxing and safe\" places for pupils who want to talk about their mental health. In June, Haydn and his dog Celog plan to walk the entire Pembrokeshire coastal path in one go - the equivalent distance to climbing Everest - to raise money for Bronwen's Wish. To donate to the challenge, dubbed 'Man and Mutt climb Everest', please go here. \"It'll take three weeks in all as I have arthritis in both knees so I'll likely need some rest days. We'll use a few campsites along the way, do some wild camping and hopefully a night on the sofa halfway around. I know Bron will be in my thoughts the whole time.\" A full inquest into Bronwen's death is set to take place between May 23 and 25 and the family are making a complaint against Cardiff and Vale University Health Board for failures in her care. A spokeswoman for the health board said: \"Our thoughts are with the family and friends of Bronwen at this incredibly sad time. An investigation report has been shared with the family and we reiterate the offer for a further meeting to discuss the findings.\" The Samaritans is available 24/7 if you need to talk.

After many months of pain and trauma, Bronwen was allegedly told by medical staff that if she were to find herself in a crisis in the future, the police would arrest her. This decision, her family claims, was the final straw. Haydn, a retired police officer, admitted that he has struggled to shake the memory of the last day he saw Bronwen alive. He recalled: \"That week she was happy, smiling and in a really good place. We hadn't seen her like that for ages. Unbeknown to us she had this plan to take her own life. In a way she was saying goodbye to us, but nobody knew. \"She had been trying to do it for a long time. We've been told she was probably feeling a sense of elation and a sense of knowing that 'I'm going to take my life and my family will be able to get on with their lives'.\" Bronwen was found unresponsive at a hotel in Cardiff and died on Thursday, August 27, 2020. As well as writing to Cardiff and Vale University Health Board in a last-ditch cry for help, she penned a letter to her mum, dad and two younger sisters, Tesni and Cerys. \"She said she wanted us to know that she had the best childhood ever and that we'd done nothing wrong. It was just heartbreaking,\" added Haydn. \"We had literally lost all hope. We couldn't find a way of going forward and her mental health team had locked her in this cocoon and insisted that this was the therapy she should be having.\" Haydn, who is now seeing a therapist himself, added: \"Now I'm retired, you see photographs of her around the house all the time and it brings it all back. I've been miserable, tired and angry - I think we all have.\" Her heartbroken family claims that if they had been given more of a say in her care - which would have led to a more tailored and bespoke approach - she could still be alive today. They said Bronwen experienced \"a devastating injustice in her care\" and was treated with a \"blanket approach\" which had little effect on improving her mental health. Since the tragedy, Bronwen's family have set up Bronwen's Wish, a charity which aims to provide \"safe spaces\" for young people experiencing challenges with their mental health. It aims to provide wellbeing pods in primary and secondary schools which will act as \"quiet, relaxing and safe\" places for pupils who want to talk about their mental health. In June, Haydn and his dog Celog plan to walk the entire Pembrokeshire coastal path in one go - the equivalent distance to climbing Everest - to raise money for Bronwen's Wish. To donate to the challenge, dubbed 'Man and Mutt climb Everest', please go here. \"It'll take three weeks in all as I have arthritis in both knees so I'll likely need some rest days. We'll use a few campsites along the way, do some wild camping and hopefully a night on the sofa halfway around. I know Bron will be in my thoughts the whole time.\" A full inquest into Bronwen's death is set to take place between May 23 and 25 and the family are making a complaint against Cardiff and Vale University Health Board for failures in her care. A spokeswoman for the health board said: \"Our thoughts are with the family and friends of Bronwen at this incredibly sad time. An investigation report has been shared with the family and we reiterate the offer for a further meeting to discuss the findings.\" The Samaritans is available 24/7 if you need to talk.

      "Local police in France have said that John Boyes, 63, hit his wife with a baseball bat before strangling her, then he hung himself but his family dispute the prosecutors account of events A British family has disputed the account of French police saying that a husband beat his wife with a baseball bat and strangled her before hanging himself. John Boyes and his wife Kathryn were discovered dead at their home in the Pyrenees. Local French police said that the 63-year-old British marathon champion beat his wife to a grisly death with a baseball bat before he took his own life. Officers claimed their idyllic life in France, where they ran a retreat while 65-year-old Kathryn worked as an artist, was a front for deeper issues. They said the couple, originally from Bournemouth, was experiencing financial difficulties because of a suicide note written on a computer. The couple had been dead for some time when police found them. But John\u2019s brother, Robert, dismissed the murder-suicide theory. He said he spoke to his brother every Sunday and that he had never mentioned any issues with his marriage or money. Talking to The Times, he said: \u201cWhen I first heard they had died I assumed they were victims of a robbery because their house is in a remote area. I want the police to carry out a full investigation and not assume John killed Kath.\u201d John was a well-known long distance runner in the 1980s and combined a career in the Royal Mail with his athletics where he won marathons across the world. Him and Kathryn, who worked at Barclays bank in Southampton, met during a running camp in Lanzarote and the pair moved to France in 2004. They ran a specialised retreat for runners and cyclists and had guests included Steve Wray, the British 100km record-holder, and Chris Boardman, the Olympic gold-medal winning cyclist. Robert said that two years ago the couple found maintaining the five acre property too difficult so decided to retire. They sold up and retired to a smaller property nearby in Boudrac. Robert said that they both had their work pensions and were not far off claiming their state pensions as well. He added he couldn\u2019t imagine his brother murdering his sister-in-law and said they had had a \u201cwonderful life\u201d in France. He also dismissed reports they had run out of money converting the house into holiday accommodation. After two weeks of not hearing anything from his brother, Robert became concerned and a friend, who was due to go cycling with John, discovered their bodies last Sunday. John\u2019s Stava account showed that as recently as April 12 he completed a 3.6mile run. The local prosecutor Christophe Amunzateguy said the John had hit his wife with a baseball bat before he strangled her. He then went into an annexe and hung himself, they said.

      "Paula Halliday, 33, worked as an auxiliary nurse and after a number of \"failings\" from health services she took her own life as she struggled with a traumatic event where \"something happened in London\" A young mum has tragically taken her own life after a number of \"failings\" from medical services as she experienced a traumatic event the year before in London. Paula Halliday had struggled with her mental health and hadn\u2019t seen her two young girls since the incident in October 2021. In the time since, on a number of occasions, she took overdoses and said she wanted to kill herself, Lancs Live reported . The 33-year-old from High Wycombe was being seen by mental health services - but a number of \u201cfailings\u201d meant she didn\u2019t receive the care she should have. When she killed herself, her body was found by her then partner and she had left a number of notes including one that simply read: \u201cIt\u2019s my time\u201d. An inquest into her death at Preston Crown Court heard how the auxiliary nurse began seeing Amy Cooper in September 2021. Speaking to the inquest, Miss Cooper said: \"I rang the crisis team once when she was texting me at night because she was just beside herself and I didn't know what to do. \"She was drinking a lot, every day. In October 2021 something happened in London and she was quite traumatised by it. \"She was seeing someone from the mental health team every week and they would ring her every other day to check in on her but she felt let down by them and said they weren't listening to her. \u201cShe was always seeing someone different so she kept having to go over what happened every time and she found that really distressing.\" Samantha Ferguson, a matron at Lancashire Care which is part of Lancashire and South Cumbria NHS Foundation Trust which provides mental health services, admitted there had been several failings in Paula's care. The inquest heard that the team had been unwilling to start any psychiatric treatment or medication until Paula managed to reduce her alcohol intake. The matron said: \"Handovers weren't always fully completed and risks weren't always discussed. \"It was sporadic. Some people had to look through the notes to familiarise themselves with her. \u201cShe saw a number of different people at her face-to-face appointments which isn't ideal. \"What we would have liked to have been better was not necessarily more face-to-face appointments but better documented telephone calls and the ability to escalate a higher evidence of risk. \u201cAnd more face-to-face contact would have been expected given the high level of risk.\" What crimes have been reported in your neighbourhood?

This included plans to increase staffing and issuing stricter guidance when handing over patients during morning meetings. Staff have also been trained on the importance of clinical curiosity, documenting clinical history and risk assessments. Claire Gibson, a consultant nurse at LSCFT, apologised to Paula's family for the failings in her care.

      "Catalin Micu, 54, killed mum-of-one Ramona Stoia, 35, in a suspected murder-suicide on April 11 in at their tattoo studio called GothInk Studio in Canterbury, Kent A tattoo artist stabbed his wife to death in an \"unprovoked attack\" before turning the knife on himself in the studio where they worked, an inquest heard today. Catalin Micu, 54, killed mum-of-one Ramona Stoia, 35, in a suspected murder-suicide on April 11 in Canterbury, Kent. Not long after their deaths it came out that Micu was facing allegations he raped Ramona multiple times throughout their marriage. The couple has a young child together. Micu was on police bail when he was found dead at their GothInk Studio with Ramona. Micu died from a stab wound to the stomach, an inquest into his death at County Hall in Maidstone, Kent heard. An earlier hearing this week heard Ramona suffered a knife wound to her neck. Coroner Katrina Hepburn said Micu killed his wife before he was seen going behind a curtain before his death. Before the apparent murder-suicide, Micu was interviewed by police after his wife accused him of multiple sexual assaults against her. Kent Police then referred itself to police watchdog the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) following its contact with the couple before their deaths. The IPOC has since confirmed it will not be investigating and the force will be left to carry out its own probe into the handling of the case. The watchdog added that it will scrutinise the results of the internal investigation. On April 11, dozens of armed police swooped in at the studio at about 5.20pm, where they found the couple dead. Detectives are not looking for anyone else in connection to their deaths. Ramona's is being treated as suspicious and Micu's is not, police said. Ramona's death led to an outpouring of tributes, where she was a well-known tattoo artist in the community. A collage of pictures of Ramona has since been put up on the doors of the shop, along with dozens of flowers, candles and written tributes. One heartfelt poem, called Shining Star, reads: \"A shining star snatched from our sky. The question we ask ourselves is why? \"A wonderful spirit loved by all. An amazing lady so beautiful. \"Taken by the angels in such a cruel way. So heartbroken can't find the words to say. \"The tattoos you created are your legacy. Up in heaven now spirit flying free.\" A tribute left at the scene reads: \"RIP Ramona. You were a beautiful soul. You will be missed so much.\" Another says: \"I never knew you but unfortunately can relate to your experiences. You deserved to be here and free of violence. I hope you have some sense of peace.\" In February, Ramona secured a non-molestation order - a court injunction restricting or banning contact - against Micu. The tattoo artists married in Las Vegas four years ago but are understood to have recently separated. It is thought the couple - who have a young son - continued to live together, but Micu was banned from \u201charassing or pestering\u201d her. On March 26, Micu was arrested on suspicion of having breached this order, and of seriously sexually assaulting his wife. Ramona came forward with a series of historic allegations of rape against her husband, dating back throughout their 16-year relationship but primarily taking place in the last few years. There were five separate allegations, all of which reportedly took place at the family home. Following his arrest, Micu was placed on police bail until April 20. Anyone who has any concerns or information regarding the incident is asked to contact the police via the Kent Police website or by calling 101, quoting 11-0995, or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

      "Gaia Pope-Sutherland's was worried about the imminent release from prison of a man she had accused of raping her and her mental health was suffering, an inquest heard A missing teenager had feared she was pregnant days before her death, an inquest heard today. Gaia Pope-Sutherland, 19, was reported missing from her home in Swanage, Dorset on November 7, 2017. Her body was found 11 days later in the undergrowth. Dorset Coroner's Court heard that Gaia's mental health was suffering due to worries about the imminent release from prison of a man she had accused of raping her. She had also recently split up with her boyfriend and had been sent indecent images on social media, the inquest heard. Gaia, who suffered from severe epilepsy and post-traumatic stress disorder, had been experiencing \"ongoing manic episodes\" in the weeks before her disappearance, it was said. Forensic pathologist Dr Russell Delaney told the hearing her naked body was found in deep undergrowth and that she had died from hypothermia. Gaia's clothing was found scattered across a field as if she had been removing it as she walked. Dr Delaney said told the hearing at the time of her disappearance she had recently split from her boyfriend and had become convinced she was pregnant, even though a test was negative. He said there was no medical evidence she was pregnant at the time of her death. Gaia had been due to see the GP for an appointment at 5pm the day she vanished. Dr Delaney said the day she disappeared the teen left her aunt's home at about 3.40pm and went to a friend's where she was \"behaving irrationally and began undressing\". Gaia redressed but left without her coat, and the last known sighting of her was a few minutes later. Dr Delaney said the post-mortem examination found no signs of trauma, but there was evidence of Wischnewski spots in the lining of her stomach - a sign of hypothermia. The pathologist said there were several possibilities why Gaia had undressed before her death. It is possible Gaia was suffering from \"paradoxical undressing\" - where she thought she was overheating and removed her clothing. Another possibility could have been her declining mental health. He said: \"It is possible she was undressed because of her deteriorating mental health and that has made her vulnerable to hypothermia. \"The deterioration of her mental health has led to her being outside, and cold and wet, and led to her becoming more confused with hypothermia. \"The undressing is typical of paradoxical undressing and hypothermia.\" She also had minor cuts to her feet and shins, consistent with walking through gorse and brambles while not wearing shoes or socks. Dr Delaney described a condition called \"hide and die\" where someone suffering from hypothermia burrows into a closed space. Gaia, who used cannabis and ecstasy, was prescribed medication to treat up to five seizures a day, but Dr Delaney could not be sure she had suffered one before her death. He said: \"I am certain that hypothermia has made a significant contribution to her death. \"It is significant to explain her death alone. It could have acted in concert with epilepsy. \"In the absence of anyone witnessing the seizure, there isn't a way of determining to a significant degree of certainty that someone has had a seizure immediately prior to death.\" Dr Delaney said he believed Gaia had died a \"number of days\" before her body was found but was unable to say exactly when. He said: \"I would always urge caution by trying to be too specific and narrow the time frame down too much.\" Research entomologist Martin Hall has previously told the inquest that having examined blowfly larvae recovered from the teenager's body he believed the latest she was alive was November 9.

It could have acted in concert with epilepsy. \"In the absence of anyone witnessing the seizure, there isn't a way of determining to a significant degree of certainty that someone has had a seizure immediately prior to death.\" Dr Delaney said he believed Gaia had died a \"number of days\" before her body was found but was unable to say exactly when. He said: \"I would always urge caution by trying to be too specific and narrow the time frame down too much.\" Research entomologist Martin Hall has previously told the inquest that having examined blowfly larvae recovered from the teenager's body he believed the latest she was alive was November 9.

      "Sergey Protosenya, 55, is suspected of killing his wife Natalya and his daughter, 18, at their villa in Spain but his son Fedor insists his dad is not a killer A Russian millionaire accused of killing his wife, daughter and himself was actually murdered, according to his son. Former gas tycoon Sergey Protosenya, 55, allegedly beat his wife Natalya, 53, and 18-year-old daughter Maria to death with an axe at their luxury Spanish villa before killing himself. It is one of four recent 'suicides' of Russian gas business executives who are believed to be linked to Vladimir Putin's circle, with their deaths widely considered 'suspicious'. Catalan police are still treating the deaths as a double murder-suicide. But Mr Protosenya's son Fedor spoke out on Tuesday insisting that his dad was not a killer and could never harm his family. His comments come amid speculation that the crime could be a triple mafia murder disguised as domestic violence. The 22-year-old university student spoke after arriving at the Costa Brava resort of Lloret de Mar where his relatives were found dead at their holiday home on April 19. \"My father is not a killer. He loved my mother and especially Maria my sister,\" Fedor told Mail Online. \u201cShe was his princess. He could never do anything to harm them. I don\u2019t know what happened that night but I know that my dad did not hurt them.\u201d Josep Milan, the head of the regional Mossos d\u2019Esquadra police force for the province of Girona, which includes Lloret de Mar, gave a recent update on the case. Speaking ahead of Fedor\u2019s comments, he said: \u201cInvestigators are focusing on a person who has committed suicide and two other people found dead inside a property and that is what we\u2019re looking at. \u201cEverything points to it being a domestic violence crime, a double murder and subsequent homicide.\" The police chief described reports pointing to the possible involvement of the Russian mafia in the crime as \u201cspeculative.\u201d A Mossos source insisted \u201cnothing has changed since Mr Milan spoke last week.\" They added: \"This is still being treated as a double murder and subsequent suicide.\u201d Fedor had stayed behind at the family home in the French city of Bordeaux while his relatives travelled to Lloret de Mar to spend their Easter holiday at their Catalan villa. He raised the alarm through a friend of his father\u2019s last Tuesday morning after his phone calls to the house went unanswered. The friend alerted police who found Mr Protosenya hanging lifeless from a noose tied to a garden railing and the bodies of his wife Natalya, 53, and their 18-year-old daughter Maria inside. Police have been working on the theory Mr Protosenya, who had been deputy chairman of major Russian gas firm Novotek, attacked his daughter with an axe and knife while she slept before murdering his wife in the same way and then taking his own life. Local reports in the aftermath of the gruesome discovery said Fedor was quick to raise the alarm when he could not reach his family by phone because he had been left \u201cdisturbed\u201d by the last phone conversation he had with them last Monday evening. The Spanish Government Delegation for Gender Violence has already registered Sergey\u2019s wife as the 12th person so far this year in Spain killed by her partner or former partner - and the 1,138th since records began in 2003. Spain\u2019s Equality Minister, without waiting for the court investigation into the crime to be concluded, left little doubt she believed Mr Protosenya was to blame in her condemnation of the murders last week by describing them as gender-related killings in a press address. The results of the autopsies have not been made public as is normal in Spain, although the information being released on the ongoing probe into the crimes has been limited by a secrecy order placed over it by the investigating judge.

An interview police were planning with Mr Protosenya, the autopsies, and analysis of CCTV cameras at the Lloret de Mar house as well as phone records, were seen as important to the ongoing investigation but no information about any progress in the probe has been made public. Days before the Lloret de Mar discovery, the body of Vladislav Avayev, 51, was found in his elite Moscow penthouse alongside his wife Yelena, 47, and daughter, Maria, 13, in another apparent murder-suicide.

      "Richard Jeavons, 37, was found dead in the living room of his home in Chelmsley Wood, West Midlands - police tried to save his life, but CPR efforts failed to revive him A dad-of-four tragically took his own life after a series of mental health struggles and drug misuse, an inquest heard. Richard Jeavons, 37, was found dead in the living room of his home in Chelmsley Wood, West Midlands, on December 2. He had penned heartfelt notes to his boys and parents before his death. Police tried to save his life, but CPR efforts failed to revive him, Birmingham Live reports. Richard, a Birmingham-born electrician, was struggling after \"sad news\" he would no longer be able to see his children after a dangerous driving conviction. He was given the news as he was handed a two-year community order for theft, attempted theft, assault and dangerous driving in September last year. He was told he could not have contact until his sons turned 18, banned from driving for 18 months and ordered to pay \u00a3200 compensation alongside a \u00a3100 fine. Assistant Coroner Rebecca Ollivere recorded a verdict of suicide as the inquest concluded at Birmingham Coroner's Court on Tuesday, April 19. The inquest heard how he was suffering from emotionally unstable personality disorder, substance misuse, ADHD and drug-related psychotic symptoms. When he was first referred to the early intervention service at Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Trust in 2018, he had been motivated to engage. Miss Ollivere told the court: \"He struggled with his mental health and substance misuse. He also had a history of various suicide attempts over the years and he had ADHD. \"Richard was referred to the early intervention service, and he remained with them for three years. It became apparent during this time that his psychosis was not related to a specific mental health condition, but was due to his misuse of drugs.\" He was discharged into the community and allocated a care coordinator. But over the summer of 2021, he became \"very unstable\" and he was added to the waiting list for a hospital bed. \"While awaiting a bed, his mental state improved and after further review, it was decided it was no longer required,\" the assistant coroner continued. \"In September, he received upsetting news that he was no longer going to be able to have contact with his children. However, by November, his mental state had improved somewhat and he was engaging with services.\" Losing contact with his children led to Richard increasing his substance misuse and suffering from low moods. However, he was trying to engage with the services by attending cycling groups and narcotics anonymous. He managed to reduce his substance misuse and on December 1, he called his care coordinator, Geraldine Avis, to discuss his future. Richard was even \"humorous\" as he spoke of plans to go into town and get a job, get fit for the summer, buy a car and obtain a bus pass, she told the inquest. He gave no indication that he would harm himself, the court heard. But within hours, police officers were called to his Birmingham home - where he was sadly found dead alongside two suicide notes for his children and parents. The assistant coroner added: \"Later that night, officers were called to Richard's address after reports of a male with a knife. Sadly when officers gained entry to the property, they found him in his living room and despite CPR being attempted, sadly he could not be revived.\" No care or service delivery problems or missed opportunities were found in his care, a root cause analysis concluded.

      "Benjamin Davis, from Greater Manchester, was given the reference \"in the context that his autism diagnosis was... part of him but not all of him\", a court heard A 22-year-old took his own life after being given a gravestone reference during a therapy session, a court heard. Benjamin Davis, also known as Binyomin Chaim Davis, took his own life only a few months after the session, having \"never got over that experience,\" his dad said. The young man was found at his home in Prestwich, Greater Manchester, and died at Salford Royal Hospital in November five days later. An inquest was held at Bolton Coroner's Court on Wednesday where private counsellor Avremi Rosenberg admitted that he should have used different wording in his session with Benjamin, who was 21 at the time. He also accepted that the language was \"inappropriate\", reports Manchester Evening News. Mr Davis, Benjamin's dad, told the court that his son had a \"charming smile\" and was a \"special person.\" Speaking at the inquest, he said: \u201cWe really miss him. He had a kind nature with a charming smile. He was a great student, he enjoyed photography, walking, and spending time with his family. He was a real pleasure to be with and he\u2019s missed by family and friends.\u201d Despite his academic prowess, Benjamin struggled initially to fit in at school but eventually made a close knit group of friends. His challenges at school meant Benjamin was diagnosed with depression and anxiety in 2018, Mr Davis continued. The youngster was also diagnosed with autism in 2021, assistant coroner Rachel Syed heard. After this diagnosis, Benjamin had five counselling sessions with Mr Rosenberg in spring last year. And it was during these sessions in which Mr Rosenberg referenced a gravestone, Mr Davis said. He added: \"I asked Mr Rosenberg about it and he confirmed he did [say it]. \"When asked why used the imagery, Mr Rosenberg said he said 'in the context that his autism diagnosis was\u2026 part of him but not all of him'.\" He added: \u201cBenjamin approached me because he knew I was a counsellor with experience with working with people on the autism spectrum. In hindsight, this would have been better dealt with by the NHS. I did apologise to Benjamin for the way it came over. \"It was definitely not said in a blunt way. It was very much in the context that his autism diagnosis was very important and it was part of him but not all of him, and in that context what would be written on his gravestone. In the future whatever I can do to help you to come to terms about what has happened, I would properly arrange it. I express my sincerest, sincerest condolences.\" When asked by the coroner if his choice of words was \"inappropriate\", Mr Rosenberg replied: \"Definitely, yes.\" Ms Syed said at the conclusion of the hearing that she would be writing a letter of concern to Mr Rosenberg\u2019s organisation. She also will be writing letters of concern to Benjamin\u2019s GP surgery Whittaker Lane Medical Centre and Greater Manchester Mental Health Trust (GMMH). The coroner explained: \"A formal letter of concern will be written to the GP, GMMH, and the private organisation, highlighting the need to ensure a more collaborative working approach between these organisations and sharing information such as diagnoses of autism. \"I will also reference the need to have more training on autism as a condition.\" Earlier in the hearing, Benjamin\u2019s GP in the final months of his life, Dr Rebecca-Ann Sheppard-Hickey, said she could not find a record of a formal autism diagnosis in his notes. Dr Ruth Watson, from GMMH, carried out an internal review of Benjamin\u2019s care, and also admitted mistakes were made with clinical staff now receiving more in-depth training on autism. She said: \"The main focus is that staff need additional training on autism. It is going to be added to our clinical risk training as an additional focus point.\" Dr Watson did however add it was \"difficult to say\" if Benjamin\u2019s death was preventable from the perspective of mental health services, as his last involvement with the service came around two months before his passing. Recording a verdict of suicide, Ms Syed confirmed that Benjamin\u2019s medical cause of death was hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. She concluded: \"I am sadly satisfied to the relevant legal threshold [Benjamin] intended to take his own life. I am therefore in law required to record a verdict of suicide. I hope you can focus on the wonderful memories you have of Benjamin.\" The Samaritans is available 24/7 if you need to talk.

      "WARNING, DISTURBING CONTENT: Semina Halliwell took her own life after an interview with police and her distraught mum has raised concerns about how her daughter's rape allegation was handled A heartbroken mum who raised concerns about how police handled her daughter's rape allegation has shared a haunting final photo taken days before she took her own life. Semina Halliwell, 12, died after spending four nights in hospital days after a police interview where she was \"made to feel like an inconvenience\". Her grieving mum Rachel wants everyone to see the harrowing last picture of her little girl taken just days before her death last year, the Liverpool Echo reports. The Year 7 pupil from Southport, Merseyside, told police she was raped by an older boy who she said had groomed her over Snapchat. Rachel has now released a photograph of Semina taken in hospital just days before she died, as she raised concerns over how the youngster was treated after coming forward. The parent said Merseyside Police officers investigating the alleged rape made Semina feel like an 'inconvenience' and has complained to the Independent Office for Police Conduct. Rachel reached out to police after Semina broke down and told her about the alleged rape following a severe incident of self-harm. She says she wants the image released today to act as a warning to others on the devastating impact bullying can have on others. Rachel said a detective \"started talking about all the forms he'd have to fill in and how long it would take him to fill those forms in\". The mother's aunt Clare Halliwell says the detective then told Semina: \"It's your word against his and do you really want this hanging over your head for 18 months, because it wouldn't go to court for 18 months to two years\". Rachel says she believes police \"failed her daughter\". Merseyside Police today said it was \"not appropriate\" to comment on the issues raised ahead of a planned inquest into Semina's death. A spokesperson for the force said: \"The matter is currently being considered by the Sefton, Knowsley and St Helens coroner and as such it is not appropriate for Merseyside Police to comment on any of the substantive issues raised at this time, as we would not wish to prejudice the coronial investigation. However, we have, and are, co-operating fully with the coroner in this matter.\" A spokesperson for the coroners' office also said they were unable to comment on this or any case that is under investigation. The spokesperson added: \"The date of inquest will be published in due course.\" Semina's tragic case was raised at a parliamentary committee on June 23, 2021, when Labour MP Apsana Begum asked then-Education Secretary Gavin Williamson what more could be done to help protect children from sexual harassment and abuse. Ms Begum said: \"I wanted to highlight the case of Semina who was 12 years old who disclosed that she'd been raped, and has committed suicide last week.\" Following her death, Rachel feared Semina's bullies would \"gatecrash\" her funeral. Rachel had initially said \"everyone is invited\" to celebrate Semina's short life, but she later received some horrifying messages. Screenshots seen by the publication appeared to show someone who knew Semina telling Rachel they had been told they'd \"get battered at the funeral\" if they attended.

He said \u201cThis is the final resting place of a beloved family member, and I can only imagine how upsetting it must have been for their loved ones to find that the grave had been treated in this way. \"While thankfully no permanent damage has been caused, it will have caused lasting distress to the family.\" Merseyside Police today confirmed no charges or arrests have been made in relation to the attack on Semina's grave.

      "WARNING, DISTURBING CONTENT: Semina Halliwell took her own life after an interview with police and her distraught mum has raised concerns about how her daughter's rape allegation was handled A heartbroken mum who raised concerns about how police handled her daughter's rape allegation has shared a haunting final photo taken days before she took her own life. Semina Halliwell, 12, died after spending four nights in hospital days after a police interview where she was \"made to feel like an inconvenience\". Her grieving mum Rachel wants everyone to see the harrowing last picture of her little girl taken just days before her death last year, the Liverpool Echo reports. The Year 7 pupil from Southport, Merseyside, told police she was raped by an older boy who she said had groomed her over Snapchat. Rachel has now released a photograph of Semina taken in hospital just days before she died, as she raised concerns over how the youngster was treated after coming forward. The parent said Merseyside Police officers investigating the alleged rape made Semina feel like an 'inconvenience' and has complained to the Independent Office for Police Conduct. Rachel reached out to police after Semina broke down and told her about the alleged rape following a severe incident of self-harm. She says she wants the image released today to act as a warning to others on the devastating impact bullying can have on others. Rachel said a detective \"started talking about all the forms he'd have to fill in and how long it would take him to fill those forms in\".

      "Chloe Barber, of Driffield, East Yorkshire, was bullied at school, self-harmed and eventually took her own life at home in November last year. Her mum has shared her grief A devastated mother has shared her grief after her teenage daughter was found hanged at the family home. Kirsten Barber said Chloe Barber, 18, fell through the cracks of the mental health system after several stays in psychiatric hospitals. Her brother Reece Barber, 15, discovered Chloe unresponsive and, though her called 999 and gave Chloe CPR, the teenager was pronounced dead at the home in Driffield, East Yorkshire. Speaking today, grief-stricken Kirsten said Chloe struggled after being diagnosed with unstable personality disorder. She told Hull Live : \"You know when people say they\u2019re heartbroken? This is heartbroken. \"When you split up with your boyfriend and stuff like that you think you know heartbreak. But this is heartbreak. Anyone who is able to can donate to Kirsten's JustGiving page for their Three Peaks challenge for Chloe here. \"There are times when I just want to tell Chloe something, like when our dogs have done something daft and then you remember you can\u2019t. \"But I know she\u2019s still here. I had Covid last month and the worst thing about it was losing my sense of smell. I went into her bedroom because I just go in there every so often to be near her, and I couldn\u2019t smell her.\" The family had first noticed signs Chloe was struggling in 2017 when she was a victim of bullying at school. She also self-harmed as her condition deteriorated over the following years. On one occasion, Chloe didn't return to Mill Lodge Hospital in York after \"going for a walk\". And in early 2021, the teenager was hospitalised at Cygnet Health Care where her problems with self harm became worse. It was at Cygnet where she also met friend Chelsea Blue Mooney, a teenager from Bridlington, North Yorkshire, who shortly later died while in the unit's care. Chloe was left devastated by 17-year-old Chelsea\u2019s death in April last year. Kirsten continued: \"Mental health is an invisible killer. If someone\u2019s got cancer or a broken leg you can physically see it and you can physically mend it. \"We still don\u2019t know exactly what Chloe was going through. She was a very secretive person.\" Chloe took her own life in November last year. Kirsten is taking on the Yorkshire Three Peaks later this spring to raise cash for young suicide charity Papyrus. Figures released by the Office of National Statistics (ONS) this week show 587 people in Yorkshire & the Humber took their lives in 2021 - of which 419 were men or boys and 168 women or girls. Data suggests suicide figures did not rise during the pandemic, although have slowly risen over the past 10 years. And while suicide remains the biggest killer of young men, the number of female suicides has been insidiously creeping up in recent years. Papyrus supports young people affected by suicide and suicidal thoughts, and has seen a 25% increase in calls, texts and emails to its confidential HOPELINEUK service. In 2020 and 2021 at least one in every three contacts was from a child under the age of 18. Anyone who is able to can donate to Kirsten's JustGiving page for their Three Peaks challenge for Chloe here.

      "Indre Razutyte, from Pontefract, West Yorkshire, who was \"loved by everyone she met\", was found dead in her garage on March 22, Wakefield Coroner's Court was told A mother who was \"loved by everyone she met\" took her own life at home, an inquest heard. Indre Razutyte, 31, was found unresponsive in her kitchen by her ex-partner on March 22. CPR was performed at the home in Pontefract, West Yorkshire, but Indre was declared dead. Suicide notes were found in the kitchen, Yorkshire Live reports. Indre leaves behind a two-year-old daughter. Wakefield Coroner's Court heard on Friday that Indre was much loved by her colleagues at small transport firm Centika Logistics. The mother was a transport manager there, and \"made such an impression on me immediately\". Colleague Wayne Kearns, who joined the company in September last year, said: \"We're a small company, more like a family. Because of that I worked closely with Indre and we became good friends. She was like a little sister to me. \"She did used to sometimes talk about the issues she was facing, but it was such a shock to hear about her death and so heartbreaking. \"We'd spoken the day before when she was working from home. That day me and the manager had been messaging her because she hadn't come in. \"Losing Indre has felt like losing a member of the family. She was one of the nicest and kindest people I have ever met, she would help anybody. \"She was so nice, and I don't think she realised how lovely a person she was and how loved she was. I think she was worried about being left on her own.\" Indre's heartbroken family live in Lithuania, and are hoping to repatriate her home for a funeral there. Wayne and some of Indre's other colleagues have set up a GoFundMe page to help them pay for the costs of getting Indre home. As of April 8, the page is at \u00a34,795. Any money left over from the fundraising will be put into a trust fund for Indre's two-year-old daughter. \"When we had drivers at the company who were having a bad day and would snap at anyone else, Indre was the only one who could calm them down. Customers would ask for her specifically. She could relate to anybody and I don't think she realised how great she was,\" Wayne added. \"She was really good at her job and just at talking to people. We always had a laugh in the office together. If she was feeling down I'd go to Morrisons and get us cake. \"Indre made such a big impact on me straight away. I wish I could've had the time to get to know her even better.\" The full inquest has been adjourned to a later date.

      "Damilya Jussipaliyeva's boyfriend sent the revenge porn to a friend and threatened to show it to her family - coroner's court heard she was in a 'disturbed state' before taking her own life A business student whose boyfriend shared a revenge porn film of her with a friend took her own life in a \"disturbed state\", a coroner has found. Damilya Jussipaliyeva, 21, plunged 80ft to her death a week after Alessio Bianchi sent the video of her performing a sex act on him in a phone booth to a friend. Alessio, 30, was so angered by her spreading rumours about him he had threatened to show her family the clip and said he would also send them footage of her taking cocaine. Damilya left a suicide note which read: \"Alessio I love you, sorry.\" Another said: \"Mommy and Daddy I'm sorry.\" Hours before her death, Damilya and Alessio had fought outside his flat and he pushed her into a fountain, Inner West London Coroner's Court heard. Recording a narrative verdict, assistant coroner Bernard Richmond said: \"This is a tragic case. \"Her mind was plainly disturbed and in that state she formed an intention to kill herself.\" Electronic devices showed she had been searching for methods of suicides, terraces and heights, the inquest heard. \"There had been a rapid deterioration in her mental health in the last few days,\" the coroner said. \"She was in a very disturbed state immediately prior to her death.\" The coroner confirmed Damilya's injuries were consistent with a fall from a great height. He said there were \"no injuries, indicative of assault or restraint by a third party\". The coroner said Damilya had \"suffered stress, depression and anxiety due to a number if factors, including her relationship with her family, her own drug and alcohol use, difficulties in coping with her degree course and her relationship with her boyfriend.\" The coroner described how Damilya had tried to take her own life twice before and was stopped from doing so. She said that by June 1, 2017 the student's mental state had \"significantly deteriorated\". Shortly before she died at 1.20am, Damilya's mind was \"plainly disturbed and in that state she formed that intention to kill herself evidenced by goodbye notes to her parents and partner\". Alessio, who was born in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia and Damilya, who was from Kazakhstan, had been in an on-off relationship for two-and-a-half years. They met at Regent's University in 2017 where they were both studying business. Alessio said: \"She was a sweet girl. We had similar personalities. We had similar backgrounds.\" The couple's friends were aware of their tumultuous relationship and Alessio had reported her to police himself on several occasions, when she had scratched him and she had attempted suicide. He told the inquest he had prevented a suicide attempt by Ms in September 2016. The court heard they were both using drugs, including cocaine, cannabis and ketamine, as well as alcohol. She was sent a video recording on WhatsApp of her in the phone booth in north London, on May 25, 2017. Attached was a message saying: \"I am going to keep destroying you.\" One of her friends received the same clip from three different numbers, with one containing the threat: \"I will f**k you up next, my love.\" Alessio claimed she had been spreading rumours about him and he sent the sex video to make her stop.\n\n\"I just felt I had been done wrong and I wanted to get revenge,\" he said. \"She had been spreading dangerous rumours.\" \"'It's the worst thing I have ever done. My regret is sincere. I acknowledge how foolish a reaction it was. \"In hindsight it was a stupid, childish and immature and I regret it more than anything I ever did.\" Damilya reported the sending of the revenge porn to police. \"I found it really insulting and humiliating, I think he's doing this for revenge because of the argument,\" she explained. \"I am still in shock and feel broken.\" She said she was \"very scared mentally and physically\" because Alessio had threatened to send the porn video, as well as footage of her taking cocaine, to her Muslim family. Damilya told police that there had been a row at his apartment on May 12 and he had \"grabbed her by the throat, struck her four or five times, spat on her and that she had passed out for a few seconds.\" But the relationship continued even after she went to the police. On June 1 the pair went out drinking with friends, arriving back at Alessio's apartment at around 11.30pm. They had an argument before Alessio pushed Ms Jussipaliyeva into the water feature in front of the building. The violence outside the building lasted for over half an hour before the concierge called police in the early hours of June 2. The next day he received distraught text messages from Damilya. He called police who went to his flat and then to her apartment in South Wharf Road, Paddington where Damilya was found lying dead on the ground outside. In April 2018 Alessio was spared jail after admitting disclosing private sexual photographs and films with intent to cause distress and one count of assault by beating. Alessio was handed a 12-week suspended sentence, ordered to carry out a rehabilitation activity requirement and made to pay \u00a3250 costs. His defence barrister Steven Powles had said before he was sentenced: \"It was a difficult relationship, both were immature and at times, jealous of each other.\" The sight of his lover crumpled on the pavement had a lasting impact on Alessio, who has received treatment at the Nightingale Hospital for PTSD and complex bereavement disorder. \"He has lost someone who he loved and someone he intended to marry,\" Mr Powles told the court. Damilya's family, from Kazakhstan, earlier said in a statement: \"We cannot describe the pain we feel of losing our beloved Damilya. \"She was such an adorable, wonderful, loving, caring and intelligent girl. \"She loves everyone with all of her heart and tried to see the good in everyone she encountered. \"We are heartbroken to hear the details of the abuse and torment in which our daughter had to endure because of Mr Bianchi. \"She had a bright future ahead of her and had so many dreams and aspirations to accomplish great things. \"While we mourn the loss of a very good girl, we also celebrate her remarkable life and hope that the memory will live on in all that know her.\" Get email updates with the day's biggest stories ",

      "Medic Abhijeet Tavare, who joined the world-famous McKinsey management company after graduating, was found by his friends who went looking for him on the middle of the night An Oxford University -trained doctor whose life was shattered when he caught long Covid took his own life because he could not cope with the illness anymore, an inquest heard on Wednesday. The high-flying medic, who joined the world-famous McKinsey management company after graduating, was found by his doctor friends who went looking for him on the middle of the night. A coroner heard that 27-year-old Abhijeet Tavare's mother had returned to their home on London Road, Bushey, Herts., after her usual morning walk, only to realise something was wrong. She went into her son's bedroom and found his suicide notes. In a statement from Abhijeet's GP which was read to the inquest, it was revealed that the son, known as Abhi to friends, had contracted Covid- in September 2020, which he initially recovered from, only for symptoms of long Covid to emerge. The inquest in Hertford was told that he reported he was suffering from palpitations, difficulty sleeping, extreme fatigue, as well as cognitive decline caused by brain fog. The latter meant he could no longer work for the international management consulting company and moved back home with his mother. He had already seen five different doctors and therapists for his physical and mental health issues, all to no avail. He was prescribed sleep medication by his GP and it was recorded in the inquest that no mention of self-harm or suicidal ideation was reported. A statement from police constable Holly Edwards, read: \"Police received a phone call from Abhijeet's sister-in-law, saying he wasn't in his room and had left notes, saying he could no longer live with his illness and didn't want to suffer anymore. \"His mum woke up and went for a walk. She got back and noticed he hadn't left his bedroom. She opened his door and he wasn't there. Then she found the letters and immediately called his sister-in-law, who then called police.\" Officers declared him a high-risk missing person and began a search after finding CCTV of where the car he was driving was last spotted. Meanwhile, his closest friends - all junior doctors - heard the news he was missing and formed a search party. Get the stories you want straight to your inbox. Sign up to one of the Mirror's newsletters The inquest was told that a combination of police investigations and reports, as well as the friends' use of iPhone tracking and bank transaction tracking, led them to an area where he was last believed to have been. His brother, Aniket Tavare said: \"He was my younger brother. He was a very happy and well-adjusted child. Our dad passed away when he was six years old. He was very sporty and he never let life get in his way. \"When Covid struck, he stayed with my mum and worked from home. He felt fine for a little bit, but then he started rapidly declining. He was extremely frustrated by this. When I last saw him he was very different - we couldn't really talk about anything as his life was on pause. \"There were no specific mental health concerns - we knew he was down, but that was more for his circumstances. I thought he would ride it out like every other challenge he faced in life. He will be missed by a lot of people.\" Concluding the inquest, assistant Hertfordshire coroner Jonathan Stevens said: \"Abhi Tavare was an extremely talented man. He had been to Oxford University and had excelled. \"He had a very tight-knit group of friends. He was due to be best man at one of their weddings in the following year. He was an exceptionally talented person. \"He contracted long Covid and that presented him with a dramatic change to his life. He had seen numerous consultants to no avail. Once he was declared missing, the response from his friends was quite overwhelming.\" He recorded the death as suicide.

      "David Hunter is charged with murdering his wife of 52 years Janice in December, but insists it was her wish to die. Now, he has told his daughter he wants to kill himself Retired coal miner David Hunter told his daughter he would kill himself at the first opportunity after failing in a suicide pact with his terminally ill wife in Cyprus. David, 74, is charged with murdering his wife of 52 years Janice in December, but insists it was her wish to die. He is alleged to have suffocated leukaemia-stricken Janice before taking an overdose of prescription pills, however he was found and survived. Daughter Lesley Cawthorne, 49, who is supporting her dad, has revealed his agony as he faces a life sentence unless the charge is reduced to assisted dying. Speaking to her from jail in Cypriot capital Nicosia, he told her last week: \u201cI do not know how to live without her. \u201cI\u2019m Janice\u2019s husband, and without her, I don\u2019t really know who I am.\u201d David, a miner for 40 years in his native Northumberland before the pair moved to retire in Cyprus, says he acted out of love for 75-year-old Janice. Janice had \u201cbegged\u201d David for him to end her pain, Lesley says. When Lesley first spoke to him after events in December \u2013 in a tearful call as he lay in a Paphos hospital \u2013 he told her: \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I love you, but I want to be with your mum. I\u2019m so sorry but as soon as I get a chance, I will kill myself.\u201d Lesley begged him not to, saying she could not lose them both. \u201cThere are people out there doing bad things,\u201d she says. \u201cAll my dad did was love someone.\u201d Janice was diagnosed with blood cancer in 2016, and both she and David had endured heartbreak in the late 1980s that influenced their decision more than 30 years later, Lesley said. Janice\u2019s sister Kath died of leukaemia and Janice had vowed not to endure the same pain should she face a similar fate. While David\u2019s mum Rachel died of ovarian cancer, and Lesley recalls how Rachel had asked her son: \u201cJust make it stop David, I\u2019m so tired.\u201d Lesley told the Mirror how her dad \u201ctalks to mum every night\u201d from his cell, which he shares with nine other men. He dreams of his wife\u2019s screams of pain as her blood cancer took hold. \u201cHe adored her,\u201d a tearful Lesley tells us. \u201cThe only thing he really cared about was giving his family a nice life. Now it\u2019s ended like this there\u2019s a real possibility he will die alone in a foreign prison. \u201cI cannot bear the thought of anyone thinking badly of my dad, because my dad really is the loveliest of men.\u201d Lesley calls David every day and every time she is relieved to hear his voice. Lesley, a compliance consultant, said. \u201cHe\u2019s sad and very lonely.\u201d In his better moments, David tells how he longs to be back in Ashington, Northumberland, and to walk along the beach. \u201cHe talks about mum all the time. He tries to remember the good times and looks back on family holidays.\u201d Janice\u2019s side of the family fully supports David, Lesley said. \u201cThey just want him home \u2013 they love him. \u201cMum begged him for a long time (to assist her death) and was very clear about what she wanted. She was very much of the opinion that we have autonomy over our bodies.\u201d David had told Lesley that Janice asked him to help her to die but she says: \u201cMy dad was very good at reassuring me. They never really let on how bad she was.\u201d She says her parents suffered with Covid lockdowns, which she claims made it harder to get medical support. David will face a life sentence in Cyprus for a murder charge, while assisted suicide carries a maximum sentence of 10 years. He pleaded not guilty to murder in a February court hearing in Cyprus. Lesley is raising funds for legal fees via the Crowd Justice website with the total at \u00a314,000 so far. But time is running out, as David\u2019s trial in Paphos begins on April 18. Michael Polak, of UK-based Justice Abroad, is representing David. The group has written to the island\u2019s attorney general to ask for the charge to be downgraded. \u201cWe will be doing everything we can to get David home,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is in the public interest that he does not spend the rest of his life in prison. Nobody I\u2019ve spoken to in Cyprus believes David Hunter should be on trial for murder.\u201d Police turned up at Lesley\u2019s door in Norwich on December 18 to explain the situation in Cyprus. David had called his brother after taking an overdose and asked him to \u201clook after Lesley\u201d. His brother contacted UK police, who contacted Interpol and David was soon found. It is unclear if a note was left as items taken from the home have not yet been given to the defence. The next day David explained to Lesley that her mum had been in constant agony, and felt she had lost all her dignity \u2013 she had continual diarrhoea, was suffering horrific nosebleeds and her sight was going. She was unable to eat, drink or sleep, despite being exhausted. Lesley said David was unable to get her upstairs so they lay in reclining chairs downstairs, holding hands. Lesley, who has a pathological fear of flying, was unable to attend the funeral in Cyprus but helped to organise it. Janice would have turned 76 on March 30, and the day after marked the 57th anniversary of when they first met in a pub in Ashington. \u201cHe thought she was the most beautiful girl in the town,\u201d Lesley recalls. \u201cShe came over and said: \u2018You can buy me a drink if you want\u2019. He bought her a Bacardi and Coke, and that was it. They adored each other.\u201d The Samaritans is available 24/7 if you need to talk.

      "Last Thursday, five family members jumped one-by-one of a seventh-floor apartment in Montreux, Switzerland. Police said the family had become steeped in conspiracy and survivalist theories and withdrawn from society Four members of the same family killed themselves in a suspected collective suicide leap from their seventh-floor apartment. A French family jumped one after another from their apartment in the Swiss town of Montreux, local police investigating the tragic mystery said today. They added that the family appeared to be fervent conspiracy theorists, hoarding food in their apartment. Only a 15-year-old boy survived the tragedy that happened last Thursday in the town on Lake Geneva, and he now remains in a coma in a stable condition in hospital. The Vaud regional police announced that their findings \"make it possible to rule out the intervention of a third party and suggest that all the victims jumped from the balcony one after the other\". They are currently working on the theory of a collective suicide, they said. A 40-year-old man, his 41-year-old wife, her twin sister and the couple\u2019s eight-year-old daughter along with the boy, all took the 20 metre jump from their apartment. France's Journal du Dimanche newspaper said the father, Eric David, grew up in a wealthy part of Marseille and even attended one of France\u2019s most prestigious schools, the Ecole Polytechnique. The twin sisters, Nasrine and Narjisse Feraoun, grew up in a family of five children who were all educated at the elite Lycee Henri-IV in Paris. The mother was a dentist and her sister an ophthalmologist and the newspaper also said the twins were granddaughters of Algerian novelist Mouloud Feraoun. Police said that the family were \u201cwithdrawn from society\u201d before their suicide. Two officers knocked on the apartment door at 6:15am local time, asking to speak to the dad about his son\u2019s homeschool arrangement. However, after a voice asked who was at the door, they said nothing more and officers, unable to enter the apartment, left. Then, less than an hour later, just before 7am, all five leapt from the balcony within the space of five minutes. Police could find no evidence of a struggle, seemingly confirming that all of them jumped of their own accord. A step-ladder was also found on the balcony, where they jumped from. Police said: \"Before or during the events, no witnesses, including the two police officers present on the spot from 6:15 am and the passers-by at the foot of the building, heard the slightest noise or cry coming from the apartment or the balcony. \"Technical investigations show no warning signs of such an act.\" They added that since the start of the pandemic, the family had become increasingly interested in \u201cconspiracy and survivalist theories\u201d. The family lived in almost complete self-sufficiency, cutting off the outside world. They have amassed a stockpile of food, which took up most of their living space. Only the mother\u2019s twin sister worked outside the home, with neither the mum nor eight-year-old registered with local authorities. Police added that the evidence suggested the family feared authorities interfering with their lives. The Samaritans is available 24/7 if you need to talk.
