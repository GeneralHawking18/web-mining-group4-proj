      "Alexandra and Giani Fodor want to pull their 11-year-old son David, who has autism, out of mainstream school and teach him at home, however they claim Harrow Council has refused permission A mum is at her wits' end after the local council \"refused\" to let her home school her autistic son. Alexandra and Giani Fodor, from Harrow, London, said their 11-year-old son David regularly suffers panic attacks at his current school. David is due to start at secondary education in September but Harrow Council has yet to find him a place at a suitable school. He recently had an epileptic fit, accompanied by a number of seizures, MyLondon reports. Heartbroken mum Alexandra said: \"It's so difficult watching him struggle. He finds it really hard to make friends and he has a lot of additional support needs. \"Every day when he comes home, he tells me that he is waking up anxious. He is just not able to progress in a mainstream school the way other children can. \"His current school is even saying that they can't meet his needs.\" David is currently a pupil at Whitefriars School, just a five minute walk from their home, but the problem with it being a mainstream school is that staff are unable to cope with his special educational needs. The school wrote to them to tell him that David would no longer benefit from continuing his learning journey with them. In a letter addressed to Alexandra from headteacher Mr Watson, and seen by MyLondon, he wrote: \"We must conclude that it would be ineffective and unfair on David to place him in our mainstream secondary setting when he so clearly needs additional support that we cannot provide and where his progress, and in fact his future life chances, would be limited.\" He added that 'a special school is the appropriate placement for David'. Initially, Alexandra and Giani found a new school nearby which is specifically designed for children with autism. They claim they were told that there was a 99 per cent chance of him being enrolled. In the past few weeks, the family was told that David no longer had a place at that school - sending them back to square one. With the family running out of time and options before David is due to start secondary school in September, they claim they enquired whether it would be possible to teach their son at home, but were told that it would not be possible. After going back and forth with a caseworker at Harrow Council, the pair say they have battled to come up with solutions which will benefit David in the long term and give him 'the education he deserves'. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox. Sign up for the free Mirror newsletter People with autism often face huge struggles in the classroom, far more than their counterparts. Alexandra says that the biggest challenge David currently faces is getting timely intervention that will allow him to 'reach his full potential'. The family say they are now in contact with a lawyer who is willing to take up David's case, in a bid to help appeal against the decision. They insist they will continue to fight to get him a place in a school appropriate for him. The lawyers fees together with all the assessments needed to prove that David must attend one of these schools tallies up to \u00a320,000. Alexandra has been forced to quit her job to help look after David, while they have already spent a lot of their savings trying to raise money, putting a huge strain on their family resources. A spokesman for Harrow Council said: \"We do our best to ensure all special needs pupils are offered a school place that is suitable for their needs. \"In this case, the parent\u2019s preferred school deemed it would not have a suitable peer group for David. The parents can appeal this decision to the SEND tribunal. At present there are no other suitable special schools with vacancies. \"We empathise with David and his parents - and will continue to work with his existing school to ensure he is supported until an appropriate placement can be found.\" Emails seen from a Harrow Council caseworker sent to Alexandra explain that 'David is a high priority' when it comes to finding him a special needs school - but there is currently no capacity to offer further assessments or school places. A GoFundMe campaign has been set up to help the family pay for the assessments which they say will help David secure a spot at a special school. So far, \u00a3790 has been raised out of the \u00a35,000 target. Get email updates with the day's biggest stories ",
      "Ms Nevill and the family had not realised until they were back home in Norfolk that they had left their nine-year-old daughter Summer's teddy behind A mum is furious after a company asked her to fork out \u00a320 for shipping - to return her autistic daughter's teddy bear. Donna Nevill, 34, went away on a family holiday to Slough to take in the sights of nearby London, using Onpoint Apartments. But the family were unhappy with the state of their accommodation so left a day early, on Friday July 1. Ms Nevill and the family had not realised until they were back home that they had left their daughter Summer's teddy behind. Summer, aged nine, is autistic and heavily reliant on the comforter, which she struggles to sleep without. However, when the family contacted the company to let them know what happened, they say that they were told they had to pay a one-off charge of \u00a320 for it to be sent back. Onpoint Apartments has told NottinghamshireLive they make no profit from the \u00a320 fee and as a small business they cannot absorb such a cost. Ms Nevill, from Norfolk, said: \"We put Summer to bed and realised we didn't have her comforter with her - she sleeps with it every night. I messaged the apartments who said they were sending the cleaners in. The cleaners found it and I was told that if I paid postage they would send it back. \"I told them that they should really send it back for free as a gesture of goodwill as the apartment was shocking - we complained straight away and nothing was done about it. \u201cIt took me over a week of phoning them everyday asking 'what are you going to do about it?' I had an autistic, distressed child who was crying all the time because of it. \"They eventually sent me the invoice and it was \u00a320. It's just a teddy bear - it does not cost that much to send it back. I am prepared to pay a fiver, maybe a tenner, but not \u00a320. We are going abroad next week and so we need it back as my daughter needs it for the airplane. The attitude has just been 'we don't care, you're not getting it back unless you pay'. \u201cIt is absolutely shocking.\" She added that she would struggle to even afford to pay \u00a320 for the return, as the family contends with the ongoing cost of living crisis. Donna and Summer had been on holiday with Summer's dad Richard Nevill, 35, along with her sister Lilly, aged six, and four-year-old brother Aarlo. In an email seen by Nottinghamshire Live, the company tells the family that it takes no responsibility for personal belongings left behind and that the returning of such items does come at a cost. They also stated that they must pay the cleaners to go to the post office to return it via post. In a statement, the company said: \"We are aware of this matter and would like to emphasise that we appreciate the situation and the importance of the item. We detail in our terms of conditions of stay that any items left behind after check out is solely down to the responsibility of the guest. \"With this particular matter, the guest contacted us to advise that she left behind her child\u2019s teddy and needed this item back. We worked with the guest, located the teddy and offered a collection of the item, this was rejected due to the guest living too far away from the property. What is happening where you live? Find out by adding your postcode. \"We then offered to send the item at a total cost of \u00a320, payable by the guest. We would like to stress that we are by no means taking any profit from this scenario. \"As a small business, we employ individuals that charge a call out fee; this includes packaging the item, labelling the item, travelling to and from the post office and the cost to post the item (first class, recorded delivery for tracking purposes). Being a small business, this is not something we can absorb. \"We have offered solutions for this guest to ensure they receive the item, however, neither option has been accepted. We evidently would prefer this matter to be resolved and to have the item back with the owner. \u201cWe hope with the above explanation, it can be appreciated why a fee of \u00a320 has been requested as there are more costs involved than just simply posting an item. The item was left behind by the guest and this is their responsibility. \"As the item has a significant importance for her daughter, along with the understanding that this is the guests' error and the factors involved that determine the \u00a320 cost, we would have hoped for a solution from the guest instead of the need to approach a newspaper. \"We are still awaiting the guest to accept the postage fee so as we can ship this back out to her first class, recorded delivery.\" Get email updates with the day's biggest stories ",

      "Landon 'Waldy' Raber was found dead in a small pond on the property where he went missing hours earlier in Curdsville, Virginia, said the local sheriff's department A six-year-old boy with non-verbal autism and Down Syndrome has been found dead in a pond hours after he went missing. Landon 'Waldy' Raber was reported missing at 8.45pm on Sunday after wandering from his home in Curdsville, Virginia, said the local sheriff's department.

      "Mum-of-two, Tinuke Awe, says there is a huge lack of representation in educational resources about autism for children. Now, she's on a mission to release her very own children's book to prove that diversity in books can help break the stigma against autism. Publishers have been criticised for ignoring Black children in books about autism. Mum-of-two, Tinuke Awe, is now writing her own book after failing to find any literature to support her son when he was diagnosed with autism. Black pupils are reported to have the highest rate of autism in the UK, being 26% more likely to have autism than their white counterparts. Yet, a study by Centre for Literacy in Primary Education (CLPE) reported only 7% of the children\u2019s books published in the UK over the last three years featured characters of colour. Ms Awe wants her book to help tackle the stigmas and taboos about the condition. She said: \u201cWhat a lot of people don't know is the prevalence of autism is higher in black children. And those are only the diagnoses that we actually know about. \u201cWhat about the ones that are in denial, the ones that are not seeking help, the ones that are still going through the process and still waiting for a diagnosis. \u201cI just want everyone to know that autism is not a bad thing. Because there's this lack of awareness. Some of the Black community just assume it's a bad thing\u201d, she said. Ms Awe's son, Ezekiel, was diagnosed with autism last year in June and was the first member in her family to have autism. While looking for resources, Ms Awe realised the lack of representation of black characters with special needs in children's books. \u201cMy son is almost five. So four, five years ago, there were a few books but there weren't really any educational [autism] resources\u201d, she said. \u201cSo like posters and flashcards and things that you would use outside of books. And I looked and I thought, \u2018what is going on?\u2019. How come there's such a lack of representation of black children?\u201d. Ms Awe says the lack of educational materials is reinforcing the stigmas and taboos around autism. \u201cOnly 7% of books published in 2020 had minority ethnics as the main character, that's even less for black people and even less for a black person with special needs\u201d, she said. \u201cIf a child is old enough to read or listen to a book, then they're old enough for us to start teaching them about differences and autism\u201d, she said. Ms Awe says the book will take inspiration from her son and his friends to show autism is not something to fear. \u201cI think first and foremost, it's important to introduce Ezekiel as the main character and his traits so that they can look out for them and understand that he has strengths and weaknesses just like anybody else\u201d, she said. \u201cSo non-autistic children might be good at maths and maybe not so good at P.E. Ezekiel might be good at ordering things but he's not so good at speaking. I want to show that autism is not something to fear and it's not someone to be scared of. It's just a difference\u201d, she said. And whilst Ms Awe hopes her book can educate children, she wants adults as well to be able to learn something about autism. \"I say the book is for children, but honestly it's a book for adults as well. It's about the children, but it's about the adults as well\", she said. \"Because when adults don't understand and they can't adequately explain it to the children, then they just continue to build a generation of people who are kind of ignorant. \u201cSo what I'm planning to do is have a section at the end for adults, with talking points and questions that they can ask. Telling them about what autism means, and how to be around someone if they are showing traits\u201d, she said. Ms Awe says when she found out about her son's diagnosis, she felt both scared and relieved. \u201cIt was a scary time. This time last year I was a completely different person. I put my hands up and say, I didn't know enough about it. I knew a little bit because of my background but it's different when it's your child\u201d, she said. \u201cBut it also felt like a wave of relief because it's like, I can finally explain his behaviours and I can get him adequate support\u201d, she said. With her website, Mums and Tea, which she started in 2017, Ms Awe says she's been able to share her experience with other mums. \u201cI have so many Black mums and Black parents on my platform who are going through the same thing and don\u2019t even know where to start\u201d, she said. \u201cThey have seen the signs and are a bit worried or burying their head under the sand and are in denial because autism is still such a taboo subject in the Black community.\" Her story has encouraged others to come out and share their experience in raising children with autism, inspiring those who would once shy away from the subject. She said: \u201cA mum sent me a message that literally almost brought me to tears. She said, \u2018God bless you. As many walk your shoes, but don't have the courage to do what you're doing. Instead they just suffer in silence, but you've broken so many barriers and you allow people to feel safe and you fill a gap that was so needed.\u2019 \u201cWhen you hear things like, how could I not keep going?\u201d, she said. Ms Awe is now fundraising to have the book self published, with \u00a33,000 raised out of her \u00a318,000 goal. If you would like to donate to Ms Awe\u2019s Kickstarter, click here.

      "Luna Munoz from Liverpool, Merseyside, said she was forced to go home, instead of flying to see her family for the first time in years, after the ordeal at Manchester Airport A distraught mum claims she was forced to cancel family holiday after autistic son suffered a \"panic attack\" while being searched by security at UK airport. Luna Mu\u00f1oz and her son Eli, 15, were due to fly from Manchester to Boston, Massachusetts, to visit family they have not seen for three years. Eli had been given a sunflower lanyard to alert staff that he had special needs, but when he triggered the metal detector in security he had to be hand-searched. Speaking to Manchester Evening News, Luna claims Eli started to \u201cgrimace\u201d and cry while being searched, before running away in distress and having a panic attack. She said: \"I had to excuse myself to the bathroom to just cry. \"I didn\u2019t want Eli to see that. I thought, I don't think we\u2019re going to be protected or safe beyond this point.\" It was a holiday they had been looking forward to for years, but Luna said she couldn\u2019t face the possibility of further distress for Eli, and so cancelled the family's trip and returned home to Liverpool, Merseyside. Luna said: \"We haven\u2019t seen family in three years now, and this was our chance. It has been a long, long time. It was a hard choice. But we talked about it as a family and thought no, it\u2019s not worth it.\" The mum claims she made enquiries about special assistance for Eli before setting off on Wednesday (June 1). She claims his special needs entitlement included giving Eli more time to process instructions, such as at security, and finding ways in which Eli would be comfortable to be searched. Luna said she tried to speak to security staff about carrying out the search in a way Eli would find manageable, but her son had already been touched on the back and shoulder. The mum added that this was \"intimate touching\" and claims Eli had already started to show distress. Luna said: \"I don\u2019t even hug my child unless I have consent... and it\u2019s been a while. I understand this person has to do their job. But touching someone on their shoulders or their back is intimate touching, that\u2019s not touching to do their jobs.\" She added: \"They were trying to be reassuring, but for a person with special needs, that\u2019s not reassuring. \"You don\u2019t expect special treatment, but there is a way to do it. You do expect a little more in terms of time and patience.\" A spokesperson for Manchester Airport said they are \"satisfied\" that their staff did what they could to reassure Eli and Luna in this instance. Airport staff also maintain that Eli's visible lanyard was taken into consideration during the incident. A Manchester Airport spokesperson said: \u201cThe security of our passengers and staff is of paramount importance and our security process must be applied consistently. In this case, the passenger activated a walk-through metal detector and so a hand search was necessary, in line with security regulations. \u201cOur security team explained to the passenger and his mother why this was necessary prior to conducting the search. \"Security colleagues are trained in how to engage with passengers who have hidden disabilities such as autism and we are satisfied that they did their best to reassure the passengers concerned in this instance. \u201cWe are, however, sorry to hear they found the experience distressing and would welcome any feedback from Ms Munoz on how she feels the process could be improved.\u201d Get email updates with the day's biggest stories ",

      "Tracey Ham claimed half of her son Zachary's 13th birthday at Thorpe Park was wasted on the bumper cars before staff finally gave them a fast track pass so they could skip the queues A mum says her autistic son's birthday was \"ruined\" after he was refused an access pass to Thorpe Park - and claims it's \"because he's not disabled enough\". Tracy Ham, 41, receives the Disability Living Allowance as her 13-year-old son Zachary Relfe is autistic, MyLondon reported. On previous visits to the theme park the pair were given a Ride Access Pass by just showing proof of disability to staff as Zachary finds it hard to queue. However, mum Tracey claims a new policy means her son is considered \"not disabled enough\" to receive the pass. She arrived at the park on Saturday May 28 at 10.15am and was told by officials she needed to fill in a form online with seven days notice. The mum from Paddock Wood said she did not know about the change but Thorpe Park claim the Ride Access Pass was made available online to Tracey before her visit date. She filled out their application but as Zachary only gets middle-rate care - not the high-rate required - he was not eligible. However, the Ride Access Passes is guided by external regulatory bodies who determine whether someone is classed as lower rate, middle rate or higher rate, as this classification is not set by Thorpe Park and they have no input. The mum and son then spent the next four hours walking around the park with Zachary unable to manage long queues. He decided to ride the bumper cars five times instead. Tracy said: \"I was raging. I was just really angry that my money and time had been wasted, and disappointed his birthday had been ruined. He looks forward to his trip to Thorpe Park every year.\" Tracy added: \"The person who gets the rage off the child is the mother, he could not go on the things he wanted to go on. It was just a waste of time. If I had known I would not have gone there.\" She returned to customer services again and battled the dodgy WiFi to fill out the form again with Tracey estimating she spent an hour of the day just filling in forms. After it was rejected again, a member of staff decided to issue her with fast track tickets as a gesture of goodwill, allowing her to skip queues as she had hoped to in the morning. Despite being eventually issued the instant access tickets, Tracy said it was still \"a shame the day was wasted.\" She added: \"Because of the way my son is we do not go out that often, which made it harder again. There's a lot of people who go with disabled children so I imagine it's affected a lot of people.\" What is happening where you live? Find out by adding your postcode. A spokesperson for Thorpe Park told the Mirror: \"As part of our ongoing focus on providing the best possible experience for our guests when visiting our UK theme parks, we have listened to guest feedback and have moved to an advanced registration for our Ride Access Pass. \"Documentation is requested to ensure the Ride Access Pass remains effective for guests who need it, and by doing this in advance the process is more efficient for all. \"There have not been any changes to the criteria or the documentation for Ride Access Passes that we accept this season. \"The only change is the simplification of the process by centralising it and moving it online, rather than at the attraction, so guests can simply apply online ahead of their visit. \"We are committed to listening, learning and adapting to the needs of our guests, and welcome the opportunity to discuss guest experiences to help us create the best experiences possible for the future.\" Get email updates with the day's biggest stories ",

      "Lucy Beaumont tells how her mum was diagnosed with several neurodivergent conditions during lockdown, but the time allowed her to figure out why she had found certain things so challenging With all the talk of Partygate and the Sue Gray report this week, it feels a bit like time to reflect on the past two years and how Covid, lockdown and the return to a new normal have affected each of us differently. There\u2019s no question what went on in No10 in that hardest of times was wrong. But as I look back at the pandemic, for the first time now I\u2019m able to see what me and my family have gained from it. During lockdown my mum, at the age of 65, was diagnosed with high-functioning female Aspergers, ADHD and alexithymia. You might never have heard of the last condition, which affects how you express and process emotion, but one in 10 people are reported to have it. The diagnosis only came about because the world slowed down. Lockdown allowed me and my mum to reflect on how she struggles in certain situations \u2013 and excels in others. More and more women in particular are being diagnosed with neurodiversities later in life, with celebrities such as Christine McGuinness and Melanie Sykes talking openly about it in recent months. And sometimes just having a diagnosis is enough to start making sense of yourself. For Mum, the feelings of guilt, of not fitting in, being sometimes seen as rude or badly behaved, means life has been a roller coaster. These feelings have been replaced with a sense of living beyond survival mode. I instantly took to the internet to find guidance and support for myself, being an adult child of an autistic parent. My mum is extremely caring and protective over me, if anything she\u2019s overly empathetic. It must have been hard for her as a single parent. We have gone through a lot, the past is in the past, but the diagnosis triggered a lot of emotional feelings for me. I feel I had more advantages than disadvantages as the child of a mum with Asperger\u2019s but kids can feel overlooked or have to act like the parent.

But it would be great to see radical change in this area and support for children, alongside a reduction in NHS waiting times for diagnosis. If only someone could have sat down my eight-year-old self to explain to me why my mum found life so difficult and that it wasn\u2019t my fault. Gosh, I hope the support improves.

During lockdown my mum, at the age of 65, was diagnosed with high-functioning female Aspergers, ADHD and alexithymia. You might never have heard of the last condition, which affects how you express and process emotion, but one in 10 people are reported to have it. The diagnosis only came about because the world slowed down. Lockdown allowed me and my mum to reflect on how she struggles in certain situations \u2013 and excels in others. More and more women in particular are being diagnosed with neurodiversities later in life, with celebrities such as Christine McGuinness and Melanie Sykes talking openly about it in recent months. And sometimes just having a diagnosis is enough to start making sense of yourself. For Mum, the feelings of guilt, of not fitting in, being sometimes seen as rude or badly behaved, means life has been a roller coaster. These feelings have been replaced with a sense of living beyond survival mode. I instantly took to the internet to find guidance and support for myself, being an adult child of an autistic parent. My mum is extremely caring and protective over me, if anything she\u2019s overly empathetic. It must have been hard for her as a single parent. We have gone through a lot, the past is in the past, but the diagnosis triggered a lot of emotional feelings for me. I feel I had more advantages than disadvantages as the child of a mum with Asperger\u2019s but kids can feel overlooked or have to act like the parent.

Our story is unique to us and is not a comment on others and their abilities to be neurodiverse and a parent. But it would be great to see radical change in this area and support for children, alongside a reduction in NHS waiting times for diagnosis.

      "Mum Nicola Caine from Cheshire slammed airline easyJet saying \"'you wouldn\u2019t even treat animals the way we have been treated\" after the family faced a string of problems, including two flight cancellations, multiple delays and no overnight accommodation A mum of an autistic child has told how her family was made to wait for two hours on the runway in an easyJet plane only to be then told the flight had been cancelled. Nicola Caine said they were due to fly from Manchester Airport to Tenerife at 5.10pm on Monday, but that the trip that they had been waiting for \u201ctwo years\u201d to go on, quickly turned sour, the Manchester Evening News reported. The Cheshire mum has told of her \"nightmare\" experience which included the flight being cancelled twice and her family being forced to sleep on airport floors. She was travelling with her husband and two children, with the cancellation causing a \u201chuge meltdown\u201d for her 12-year-old son who has autism, it is reported. First, the passengers were told that the flight was delayed by an hour, until 6.10pm, and Ms Caine said they had arrived at 2pm so as to be there with plenty of time. Then while they were able to board the plane just after 6pm, the waiting continued as there were problems with \u201cGerman airspace\u201d and then over \u201cbaggage\u201d. She said: \u201cWe were sat on the plane for an hour and a half. \"A pilot came and said \u2018unfortunately, due to staff going over their hours, we are going to have to cancel this flight.\u2019 \"The reaction on the plane wasn\u2019t good at all. My son broke down in tears and screamed the plane down. \"Then we were told we couldn\u2019t get off the plane because an Emirates plane had just arrived, and they take priority. So we sat on the plane for another 30 minutes. \"Luckily, the staff on the plane were really good, they let us go to the front of the plane to calm my son down.\" The problems for the Caine family continued after they got off the easyJet plane as they claimed they were stuck at Manchester Airport without information. She added Manchester Airport staff advised passengers to download the easyJet app to rebook new flights. But this was not without issues according to Nicola. She added: \"Everyone was trying to get on the app, but it was crashing. No-one could get on it at all. \"The app didn't work because we were on a package holiday. While we were stood there, two cancelled easyJet flights came through from Turkey and Egypt. \"So we were left, all these people from three flights, not knowing what would happen. Luckily, we live 30 minutes from the airport, so we decided to come home. \"We didn\u2019t know whether to unpack because we didn't know whether we would be going on holiday or not.\" At 5:30am, Nicola received a text, telling her to be at Manchester Airport for 10:30am, where a coach would take them to Gatwick Airport to catch a flight to Tenerife at 7:10pm that evening. \"We were absolutely devastated,\" Nicola explained. \"We had not slept all night because my son was crying. \"I just thought, how can I go on a coach for almost five hours and sit in an airport for three hours, and then go on a four and a half hour flight? \"EasyJet said it was a suitable alternative and that we would lose our money if we didn'tgo on that trip.\" After arriving at Gatwick Airport, 240 miles away, Nicola booked her son an antigen test as his PCR had run out. At the gate, waiting to board the flight to Tenerife, the passengers had to wait over 30 minutes while the plane was cleaned. They were then told by easyJet that they could no longer operate the flight, but stand-by crew would be there for the flight in an hour. The family were then asked to return to departures, which raised alarm bells for Nicola, who suspected that the flight would be cancelled. She said: \"I questioned the staff because I knew this had happened the night before. They assured me that everything was fine. \"But we had to go back to departures, which was a tell-tale sign that we weren\u2019t getting back on the plane. \"So we went back to departures and stood at the customer service desk for another 45 minutes. \"Again, there were no easyJet people there. At 9pm, we all got an email to say the flight was cancelled.\" The passengers were asked to move to another gate and look at new flights on the easyJet app, which angered Nicola. \"I was so angry because Ihad heard it all the night before,\" she continued. \"I told the staff, this happened at Manchester Airport, we cannot book new flights on the app because we are have a package holiday. \"A police officer advised us to stay in a hotel overnight. We said, why should we have to do that, t here should be a level of service. \"The nearest hotel was \u00a3690 for the night. \"We came back to the terminal and met the other passengers, not knowing whether we were going to fly, or get taxis for another four hours to go home- because what if easyJet book us another flight?\" The Mirror's newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.

      "Rebecca Macdonald said her son was petrified of going to the toilet after the family's bathroom underwent renovations to fix a leak now has a slug infestation A mum has told how her five-year-old son is refusing to go to the toilet as her bathroom is infested with massive slugs. Mum-of-two Rebecca Macdonald, from Glasgow, has said her autistic son, Alexander, is living in fear of his own home because of a major slug issue. The family's bathroom underwent renovations to fix a leak but now has an infestation of slugs, the Daily Record reported. The home is managed by Queen's Cross Housing Association, which says it is working to fix the issue after being notified in March. Rebecca, who is a full-time carer to Alexander, said her son was petrified of the slugs and had begun bedwetting because he didn't want to go in the bathroom. The 25-year-old said: \"He is now at a stage where he is wetting himself at night-time because he doesn't go into the bathroom. \"It\"s really hard to see him kind of going back like that because of the house. \"It's really hard for him as he hates all creatures and stuff like that. \"So, getting up during the night to go to the toilet and finds slugs in the bathroom, he point-blank refuses to use the toilet. \"I'm having to pick them up and put them down the toilet pan or move them so my wee boy can go into the toilet. \"I'm also waking up during the night and the first time I went in I stepped on one, it was horrible.\" Rebecca said the issue began in January 2021 and she had spoken to her GP because of the stress caused. Shortly after the works, Rebecca started seeing slugs crawling all over her bathroom fixtures and floor. She said the housing association recently visited the property, after which more leaks were fixed and any holes sealed. However, after claiming to see another 10-12 slugs at the weekend, she called her GP. Rebecca said: \"I just spoke to my doctor about this as well because it's stressing me out, constantly having to argue with my housing association and not getting anywhere with them. \"My wee girl is only two, so she's at a stage where she wants to pick them up and I have to keep an eye on her. \"They are massive as well. I'm sending pictures and videos to the housing association. \"They told me to put salt down in my bathroom, which I've done and it has done nothing to keep them at bay.\" Jim Williams, maintenance manager at Queen's Cross Housing Association, said: \"We first knew about this problem in the property at the end of March and carried out an inspection that week. \"At that point we couldn't see signs of slugs. \"When Ms Macdonald reported the problem to us again this month, we arranged another inspection to try to identify the cause of the problem. \"This is an unusual situation but we are currently working with Ms Macdonald to try and resolve this issue to everyone's satisfaction.\" Get email updates with the day's biggest stories ",

      "An investigation has been launched into a mother's claims that her 14-year-old autistic daughter was strip-searched by Metropolitan Police officers A 15-year-old girl was left traumatised and suicidal after she was strip-searched by Met Police, according to her mum. The girl's mother claims her autistic daughter was strip-searched by Metropolitan Police officers. An investigation has been launched after the force confirmed the mum had made a complaint after she said the teenager was left traumatised and tried to kill herself. The mixed-race girl, whom the broadcaster referred to as \"Olivia\", was said to have been out with friends when they argued. The two boys phoned the police alleging that the group had attempted to rob them at knifepoint. The report comes after a backlash over revelations that a 15-year-old girl, known as Child Q, was strip-searched by female Metropolitan Police officers in 2020 in the knowledge she was menstruating - after she was wrongly suspected of carrying cannabis at her east London school. Olivia's mother, whom the BBC referred to as \"Lisa\", told BBC Radio 4's File On 4 programme that officers searched Olivia and her friends at the scene and the group were arrested in December 2020. Lisa said she told the officers on the phone that her daughter had autism and learning difficulties, and had been self-harming. Olivia was held in custody for more than 20 hours before being found to be in possession of a sharpened stick and a small blade, which her mother said was for the purpose of self-harming. The discovery, Lisa said, prompted six officers to forcibly strip Olivia and carry out an intimate search in the presence of male police. The youngster was then handcuffed and strip-searched, Lisa said. The mum said: \"Olivia was actually on her period at the time too. And they cut off her underwear in front of these grown male officers.\" \"She was absolutely distraught.\" Lisa told the broadcaster the experience had a devastating impact on her daughter's mental health. She added: \"She spent a lot of time in her room and she continued to self-harm in secret. \"And then, a few weeks later, she attempted suicide.\" The BBC reported Olivia later appeared in court accused of possession of a bladed weapon and was found not guilty after magistrates accepted the items were used for self-harming. Her family are bringing a civil case against the Met and are being represented by lawyer Gail Hadfield Granger, who has been contacted for comment. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said: \"We have received a complaint from the girl's mother, which is currently under investigation. \"We have also received notification of a potential civil claim and therefore are unable to comment further at this stage.\" Deputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor told File On 4 that strip-searches help to keep children safe while in custody.

      "Mum Candice Hudspith had just entered the Mcdonald's near Gateshead when four-year-old Harper started screaming and crying but thankfully a kind member of staff stepped in to help A mum has shared a heartwarming message of thanks after a touching display of kindness from a McDonald's staff member which \"meant the world\" to her autistic daughter. Candice Hudspith, 33, from Gateshead, visited the McDonald's on the Felling Bypass near Newcastle last weekend with her two daughters, Harper, four, and Indy, two. As they entered the restaurant Harper, who was diagnosed with autism just before her fourth birthday, suddenly became \"triggered\", beginning to scream and shout. Often, Candice said, she would leave a situation if Harper started to struggle. But thanks to the kindness of one of the restaurant's staff members, the busy mum was able to stay and enjoy a relaxing coffee, while Harper was able to calm down and enjoy a meal. Candice said: \"I don't know what had triggered Harper, when I got out of the car I knew she was hungry, but there was just something triggering her and the difficult thing is you can't ask what it is. \"Walking in she was screaming, saying 'no no no'. Everyone is looking at me like I am the mother with the screaming child. \"As I was walking in Rachel, one of the workers, said 'oh wow I think I have a flag would you like one?' \"And she looked at me and said 'you're doing an amazing job'.\" Harper ran off and hid under a seat, so the considerate worker got down on the floor with paper and crayons, inviting the little girl to colour in with her. Candice said: \"You could see Harper slowly coming out of herself. She was back in her little world, being happy Harper again. \"I literally burst into tears. I felt like I didn't even have to say that she has autism, it was like she read my mind. It was so lovely what she was doing. \"I don't think Rachel realised how good her customer service was. It may sound like nothing to others but it meant the world to me. Absolutely outstanding service.\" When Candice shared her thanks to Rachel on Facebook, her post received over 3,000 likes as people praised the McDonald's worker. The mum said she was touched by the response and shared her story in an effort to thank Rachel. She added she wanted to show difference small acts of kindness can make to struggling parents. Candice said she was also keen to encourage more people to be understanding of autism, the diagnosis that has helped her ensure her daughter gets the help she needs. What is happening where you live?

She said: \"At the moment I'm doing a course on autism just so I can be more understanding, but when she was younger - and I think quite a lot of mums could relate to this - I was, not quite in denial, but I felt as if I didn't want to label my child. \"But once you get the help and you have the diagnosis you realise it's not labelling your child, it's getting them the help that they need. \"All the doors open up and you are able to get the best for your child. If I had still been in denial I don't know where Harper would be now, but with me being the mum I am and having the support around me she's come on so much. \"If you do see a situation like that in public, you really shouldn't judge. \"I think our generation is starting to understand a lot more about autism, back in the day it would be just seen as 'naughty children' but I think there is more understanding now.\" Get email updates with the day's biggest stories ",

She said: \"At the moment I'm doing a course on autism just so I can be more understanding, but when she was younger - and I think quite a lot of mums could relate to this - I was, not quite in denial, but I felt as if I didn't want to label my child. \"But once you get the help and you have the diagnosis you realise it's not labelling your child, it's getting them the help that they need. \"All the doors open up and you are able to get the best for your child. If I had still been in denial I don't know where Harper would be now, but with me being the mum I am and having the support around me she's come on so much. \"If you do see a situation like that in public, you really shouldn't judge. \"I think our generation is starting to understand a lot more about autism, back in the day it would be just seen as 'naughty children' but I think there is more understanding now.\" Get email updates with the day's biggest stories ",

      "Autistic Larsson Hankins only drinks water from an Evian bottle and was pulled form Bude Park Primary School when he was tricked into drinking it from a tap as part of a \"game\" A furious mum removed her autistic son from school when he said he was forced to drink tap water in a \"game\", despite teachers knowing he only drinks juice or from an Evian bottle. Marie Donnelly says a staff member spotted her son Larsson Hankins, seven, not drinking from the school\u2019s reusable bottle and took him out of class to \u201cplay a game.\u201d She accused them of lying to her son, claiming her son was told he had to have a drink as his mum was concerned which she refutes every saying.

      "Laura Jordan, from Redditch, Worcs, said her son Zac has fallen behind during the seven months he has spent at home following his expulsion - and he still cannot read or even write his own name A five-year-old boy expelled for \"bad behaviour\" will have spent a year at home before he fully returns to school. Little Zac was just four-years-old when he was booted out of his school in October over behavioural issues. Mum Laura, 36, told the council her son had undiagnosed special educational needs and resisted attempts to send him to another mainstream school. The 36-year-old, from Redditch, Worcs, slammed Worcestershire County Council for failing to find Zac a place at a special needs school following his expulsion. She has even accused the council of \"breaking the law\" after Zac reached compulsory school age and was still stuck at home. However, Zac has now finally been offered a place at a new autism unit at Chaddesley Corbett school in Kidderminster. Laura told The Mirror: \u201cThe council have now offered Zac a school place and we will start the slow process of reintegration after the next half term, with an aim to start full time in September.\u201d Although Laura is pleased that Zac is finally returning to the classroom, she voiced concerns that her son will have missed out on almost a year of full-time education. She said: \u201cSeptember is a long time away. He\u2019s fallen behind. He can\u2019t read or write at the moment. \u201cHe should know how to write his name and he should be starting to read. His name is only three letters and he can\u2019t write that. It\u2019s sad. \u201cIt\u2019s affecting his development massively. Socially he\u2019s not where he should be at. He\u2019s going to find it harder to socialise with children now.\u201d Laura previously said her son had spent so much time in the house that he was scared to go outside. Just days before receiving the news about Zac\u2019s place, Laura told The Mirror that Worcestershire County Council had \"broken the law\" by missing the deadline to get her son back into school. She said: \u201cThe law states that the term after their fifth birthday they should be in education. \u201cJack turned five in February so on April 26 he should\u2019ve been back in school as that\u2019s when the kids went back after Easter. \u201cIt\u2019s so frustrating.

He was booted out over a number of behaviour problems, including attacks on other pupils and staff. Laura explained that her life has been on hold for the past seven months while looking after Zac at home. She has not been able to work because she does not have anyone around who is able to watch him. Although she has tried to teach him at home, Zac quickly loses interest. Laura is speaking out to raise awareness about the difficulties in accessing proper education for children with special needs. She said parents face a \"postcode lottery\" as councils have different policies for special educational needs.

      "Charlie Bowe, 12, who is autistic, was finally offered a place at a special school but has no transport to get there, forcing his mum to give up her job to drive him A 12-year-old autistic boy who spent six months out of school is struggling to find transport to take him to his new special school, forcing his mum to quit her job to drive him. Charlie Bowe was forced to quit his mainstream secondary school, a few weeks after enrolling as a Year 7 student, because staff couldn't meet his needs. Whilst he technically remained on roll for several months afterwards, his final lesson was in October, and he had no work allocated to him at home. His mother, Samantha Bowe, aged 32, told Stoke on Trent Live that \"it was affecting his mental health\" and \"he was really upset\". After lodging a special needs tribunal, she was relieved to be offered a place at Abbey Hill School in Meir, where Charlie started last week. She commented: \u201cIt\u2019s the best place for him.\" But Samantha has been forced to relinquish her job in order to drive Charlie from their home in Trentham every day, to the school four miles away. Stoke-on-Trent City Council have refused to provide school transport. Instead, officials gave the family a personal budget of \u00a315.38 a day to arrange taxis themselves. Samantha said: \u201cI started ringing round taxi services and they were all saying they couldn\u2019t take him. Either they didn\u2019t do school runs, they were fully booked or they said he was too young to take without a chaperone. \u201cEven if they could have taken him, I was getting quotes off some of them of \u00a350 a day.\u201d Samantha found another Abbey Hill pupil, who lives in the Staffordshire County Council area, and qualifies for a minibus to travel to school and through Trentham. However, this transport is arranged via a separate local authority and there was no spare seat. Samantha has to drop off seven-year-old son Mason at Ash Green Primary Academy, in Trentham, before taking Charlie to school. But's he's now regularly arriving late for lessons at Abbey Hill, with his mum adding: \u201cIt\u2019s taking me an hour on the school run in the morning and an hour in the afternoon. Samantha\u2019s boss at a cookware shop even contacted the council on her behalf. She said: \u201cThe local authority just said my boss needed to be a bit flexible. It made us laugh as you can\u2019t be flexible in retail. We are only a small staff.\u201d Although the job is still available if she can sort out the school transport, Samantha is currently out of work. Whilst appealing the council's transport decision, she has had to turn down the personal budget, so is funding fuel costs herself. It is just the latest in a series of battles to ensure Charlie gets the support he needs. As well as autism, he has learning difficulties and has the reading age of a six-year-old. \u201cWe waited three years for his autism assessment. He finally got it this year,\u201d said Samantha.

      "Savvy teen Sam Badger, 17, who made a staggering \u00a320,000 selling personalised phone cases from his bedroom in Tamworth, Staffordshire, was bullied in primary school and told he wouldn't amount to anything A teen entrepreneur with autism who was told he'd never succeed has made a staggering \u00a320,000 by selling phone cases from the bedroom of his family home. Sam Badger, 17, from Tamworth in Staffordshire, launched OnTheCase4U just 18 months and has shifted over 4,000 personalised cases since. The savvy teen has even opened a vending machine stocked with his products in Birmingham's Bullring shopping centre, Birmingham Live reports. Sam's designs have taken the internet by storm - and he's drummed up nearly 600,000 followers on TikTok with his popular videos - that have been watched nearly 20 million times.

      "Savvy teen Sam Badger, 17, who made a staggering \u00a320,000 selling personalised phone cases from his bedroom in Tamworth, Staffordshire, was bullied in primary school and told he wouldn't amount to anything A teen entrepreneur with autism who was told he'd never succeed has made a staggering \u00a320,000 by selling phone cases from the bedroom of his family home.

      "Kristian Jones, 12, has trouble sleeping and mum Gemma Jones sees her son change from a 'happy and smiley' boy to someone who will hurt them both at night A boy with autism hurts his mum and himself during sleepless nights caused by frustration. Kristian, a 12-year-old, has trouble sleeping and mum Gemma Jones sees her son change from a \"happy and smiley\" boy to someone who will hurt them both at night, Those who have Autism Spectrum Disorder can have sleep issues. It can lead to daytime tiredness, learning problems and behaviour concerns such as aggression and hyperactivity, The sleep issues affect other members of the family but also other family members and he repeatedly awakes in the night. Gemma hopes to raise money for a specialist bed, which cannot be funded by the NHS, she hopes will provide a safe space for Kristian. She told WalesOnline : \"Kristian was diagnosed with autism when he was two years old. \"The only way he can go to sleep is if I lie next to him, otherwise he would be up and about in the house, causing damage or chaos. \"Sometimes, he has bad days where he doesn't go to sleep before 5 o'clock in the morning and I'm left black and blue - he doesn't realise he's taking his frustration out.\" She added: \"It can happen seven days a week sometimes. He goes to stay with his dad over the weekends purely so I can sleep more than two hours and I can spend time with the other kids. \"It can be particularly challenging when he doesn't go to sleep until 5 or 6 o'clock in morning and I have to wake him at 8 to go to school - he's shattered. \"The summer holiday is the hardest time because obviously you are with him day and night. \"Whereas when he\u2019s not on holiday and he\u2019s in school, if he doesn\u2019t sleep at all at night, I know I can get a couple of hours sleep in the day. \"In the summer holiday, I don\u2019t have that option - once he\u2019s up, he\u2019s up. \"It does get draining and I\u2019m so tired. When you\u2019re tired, you\u2019re prone to things like colds and cold sores. \"I\u2019m constantly at the doctors getting cream because I come out a lot with cold sores when I\u2019m tired or stressed. \"But also, you\u2019re stressed for him - you can see his body wants to go to sleep but his body is still active. He\u2019s frustrated and you understand why he\u2019s frustrated and lashing out because he can\u2019t switch off - it\u2019s heartbreaking.\" As Kristian was recently diagnosed with epilepsy, lack of sleep can also cause more seizures. A specialist bed therefore would not only promote safe sleeping, but also a safe space for him during particularly difficult times. Gemma said: \"The specialist bed would include sensory objects and a camera. In that bed then, if Kristian is having a seizure, for example, I can see over the video. \"It\u2019s not safe leaving him on his own in his room. So this bed would make it a safer environment for him - it\u2019ll calm him down. \"I could be in the next room - I could go to bed, read a book or something, while he settles, feels safe and not anxious because he\u2019s trying to go to sleep. \"It would be life changing for the family as well. The other two are older, it would be nice to be there for them as well, help them with school and other things. \"It would be nice to do whatever I have to do and know that he is also safe. It\u2019ll be life changing for him and for us as a family.\" With the aid of her friends and family, Gemma hopes to fundraise for a \u00a35,000 specialist bed for her son, with a walk up Pen-y-Fan set to take place at the beginning of June. The mum-of-three said that the response to the fundraising so far has been \"heartwarming\". She said: \"Many of my friends and family are raising money, and we have got a lot of people coming together as a community. \"A specialist bed is over \u00a35,000 - hopefully we\u2019ll have the money and the bed set up by the summer holiday because it\u2019s crucial.

      "Sarah McGill, from Derry in northern Ireland, said her concerns started when her six-year-old girl Niamh, didn't want to interact with others from an early age A mum-of-two has described how she spotted signs that her daughter was autistic at just six months old. Sarah McGill said her concerns began when daughter Niamh, six, didn't want to interact from an early age. She said signs that Niamh had Autism Spectrum Disorder emerged when she was just six months old, but she wasn't formally diagnosed until the age of three, MyDerry reports. Her local GP turned Sarah away, ruling out the possibility of autism on several occasions, Ms McGill said. She said: \"At six months we started to notice that my daughter didn\u2019t like to be around anyone except myself and my husband, she was constantly crying. \"At that time we thought it was colic as the GP had ruled out everything else. Although in hindsight I can recognise that it was sensory overload. \"Her environments were too overstimulating for her and her crying was the only communication tool she had at that time. \"Niamh hit all her infant milestones late and some not at all. She began flapping hands, lining her toys up and her communication began to regress, she stopped babbling and vocalising. \"She was so content in her own little bubble. All this carried on for another year, with little to no change in her development. \"We saw a paediatrician at 18 months, and she said Niamh presents with autism. That was the beginning of our journey. \"I found I had to learn to think quickly on my feet and develop strategies to make life easier for my daughter.\" Last year, Sarah began to blog Niamh's journey, through AutisticAlly, which now has over 3,000 followers online. The Derry mum said it's only since setting up the blog that she realised how other families across Northern Ireland were struggling to cope. However, she said there was no need for families to fear the word autism. She said: \"Autism is not a word to be feared, it is a person to be accepted and loved. It is a word that explains why people behave and think differently. \"If you have questions about autism, ask an autistic person. The more we talk about autism, the more widely recognised it will become. \"Yes, autistic people share the same core similarities but how an autistic person experiences the world around them is completely unique to them. What is happening where you live? Find out by adding your postcode. \"Understanding each person as an individual is key and realising what works for one person may not work for another.\" Meanwhile, Sarah also revealed recently that she too had been diagnosed with the disorder, saying it had left her feeling numb. \"It took me a while to process the information and what it meant,\" Sarah added. \"I\u2019m still the same person I was before my diagnosis but it has brought clarity to my life. \"It is an explanation of why I behave the way I do and why I see and feel things differently from other people. It is a life-affirming experience that is teaching me to be kinder to myself. \"People often say, at my age why would I want to label myself as autistic, but what they don\u2019t know is that I was already labelling myself as a failure, anxious, confused, not good enough, weird, and faking my way through life. \"I always felt like an outsider, looking into a world that wasn\u2019t built for me. Not understanding why people behave the way they do and why people don\u2019t say what they mean. \"I was a people pleaser that was riddled with anxiety and depression but still had a smile on my face because I wanted to \u2018fit in\u2019, I wanted people to like me. \"I now have this positive label. This is an explanation that answers my questions about how I\u2019ve experienced my life. It fits, I fit here.\" She said it's \"paramount\" that more awareness is spread about autism inclusion and acceptance. \"The more we talk about autism, the more widely recognised it will become in our society,\" she said. \"Unless you have a child like my Niamh, who was luckily diagnosed so early in life. Many parents out there are fighting for their children to be heard, the only way that autistic people are going to be diagnosed quicker is for autism training to be made mandatory in all schools. \"With specific training on how women on the spectrum present differently to many boys. \"So many girls, like myself are being overlooked because they are quiet and don\u2019t make a fuss.

      "The woman claims two hooded youths approached her property on Almond Tree Avenue in Coventry, at around 10.30pm last Wednesday and began hurling eggs at her windows and a brick at her car A terrified mum-of-two has said she and her two autistic sons have been left 'on edge\" after her home was wrongly targeted in an attack. The woman, who has not been named, claims two hooded youths approached her property on Almond Tree Avenue in Coventry, at around 10.30pm last Wednesday and began hurling eggs at her windows. A few minutes later, after hearing a noise sounding like \"someone had been shot\", she realised the rear windscreen of her car had been shattered by a brick. It is said to have caused both emotional and financial distress for the victim as the car that was damaged was a courtesy car that she was using while her own vehicle was being repaired. She told CoventryLive : \"A neighbour came down, heard the noise, thought someone had been shot. Initially I thought just eggs had been thrown at the house, then I realised my car had been damaged.\" Speaking about the emotional impact the random attack has had on her family, the victim said: \"I live alone with my two autistic boys, one has just turned 21 and the egg hit his bedroom window. He is very on edge.\" She believes that her home was wrongly targeted, saying: \"I believe it may be mistaken address for a targeted attack, as we rarely go out or interact with people locally - keep ourselves to ourselves.\" A spokesman for West Midlands Police said: \"We've received a report of criminal damage after a brick was thrown at a car in Almond Tree Avenue, Coventry, at 10.20pm on Wednesday (April 13). \"Anyone with information can contact us via Live Chat on our website and quote 20/380617/22.\" Details can also be passed on anonymously via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or visit www.crimestoppers-uk.org.

      "Benjamin Davis, from Greater Manchester, was given the reference \"in the context that his autism diagnosis was... part of him but not all of him\", a court heard A 22-year-old took his own life after being given a gravestone reference during a therapy session, a court heard. Benjamin Davis, also known as Binyomin Chaim Davis, took his own life only a few months after the session, having \"never got over that experience,\" his dad said. The young man was found at his home in Prestwich, Greater Manchester, and died at Salford Royal Hospital in November five days later. An inquest was held at Bolton Coroner's Court on Wednesday where private counsellor Avremi Rosenberg admitted that he should have used different wording in his session with Benjamin, who was 21 at the time. He also accepted that the language was \"inappropriate\", reports Manchester Evening News. Mr Davis, Benjamin's dad, told the court that his son had a \"charming smile\" and was a \"special person.\" Speaking at the inquest, he said: \u201cWe really miss him. He had a kind nature with a charming smile. He was a great student, he enjoyed photography, walking, and spending time with his family. He was a real pleasure to be with and he\u2019s missed by family and friends.\u201d Despite his academic prowess, Benjamin struggled initially to fit in at school but eventually made a close knit group of friends. His challenges at school meant Benjamin was diagnosed with depression and anxiety in 2018, Mr Davis continued. The youngster was also diagnosed with autism in 2021, assistant coroner Rachel Syed heard. After this diagnosis, Benjamin had five counselling sessions with Mr Rosenberg in spring last year. And it was during these sessions in which Mr Rosenberg referenced a gravestone, Mr Davis said. He added: \"I asked Mr Rosenberg about it and he confirmed he did [say it]. \"When asked why used the imagery, Mr Rosenberg said he said 'in the context that his autism diagnosis was\u2026 part of him but not all of him'.\" He added: \u201cBenjamin approached me because he knew I was a counsellor with experience with working with people on the autism spectrum. In hindsight, this would have been better dealt with by the NHS. I did apologise to Benjamin for the way it came over. \"It was definitely not said in a blunt way. It was very much in the context that his autism diagnosis was very important and it was part of him but not all of him, and in that context what would be written on his gravestone. In the future whatever I can do to help you to come to terms about what has happened, I would properly arrange it. I express my sincerest, sincerest condolences.\" When asked by the coroner if his choice of words was \"inappropriate\", Mr Rosenberg replied: \"Definitely, yes.\" Ms Syed said at the conclusion of the hearing that she would be writing a letter of concern to Mr Rosenberg\u2019s organisation. She also will be writing letters of concern to Benjamin\u2019s GP surgery Whittaker Lane Medical Centre and Greater Manchester Mental Health Trust (GMMH). The coroner explained: \"A formal letter of concern will be written to the GP, GMMH, and the private organisation, highlighting the need to ensure a more collaborative working approach between these organisations and sharing information such as diagnoses of autism. \"I will also reference the need to have more training on autism as a condition.\" Earlier in the hearing, Benjamin\u2019s GP in the final months of his life, Dr Rebecca-Ann Sheppard-Hickey, said she could not find a record of a formal autism diagnosis in his notes. Dr Ruth Watson, from GMMH, carried out an internal review of Benjamin\u2019s care, and also admitted mistakes were made with clinical staff now receiving more in-depth training on autism. She said: \"The main focus is that staff need additional training on autism. It is going to be added to our clinical risk training as an additional focus point.\" Dr Watson did however add it was \"difficult to say\" if Benjamin\u2019s death was preventable from the perspective of mental health services, as his last involvement with the service came around two months before his passing. Recording a verdict of suicide, Ms Syed confirmed that Benjamin\u2019s medical cause of death was hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. She concluded: \"I am sadly satisfied to the relevant legal threshold [Benjamin] intended to take his own life. I am therefore in law required to record a verdict of suicide. I hope you can focus on the wonderful memories you have of Benjamin.\" The Samaritans is available 24/7 if you need to talk.

      "Police search teams spent eight hours searching for Kyuss Williams, four, who wandered away from his parents' house before he was found dead in a pond just ten feet away from the home A frantic search for a missing four-year-old boy with autism ended in tragedy when he was found dead in a pond by rescue teams.

      "Cassie Lee from Mold, Flintshire, claims Sychdyn Riding School refused to allow her daughter Maddie to have horse riding lessons because she is autistic, with the school claiming it was down to its insurance policy A furious mum claims her daughter was refused a horse riding lesson because her autism was \"too bad\". Cassie Lee, from Mold, Flintshire, said her 14-year-old daughter Maddie was turned down because of her additional needs. The \"heartbroken\" mum-of-three said a member of staff at Sychdyn Riding School asked \"how bad\" Maddie's autism was before refusing to allow the booking. Cassie said the incident is a painful reminder how people with disabilities are \"still not treated equally\", North Wales Live reports. Sychdyn Riding School told North Wales Live it was necessary to access Maddie's disability due to insurance concerns to ensure the safety of staff and customers. A spokesperson for the school, based near Mold, added: \"We have to consider everyone's safety, there's protocol we have to follow, and if people have different needs we have to factor that in, we don't want to put anyone at risk. \"We've never come up against this in all the years. We're not discriminating, we're just sticking to within the law.\" However, Cassie claims it was \"direct discrimination\" and showed a \"lack of empathy for people with special needs\". She added: \"I'm heartbroken, if I'm honest. I'm hurt because I've had to watch my little girl upset because she couldn't go, just because she's autistic. \"People these days say people with autism are accepted but we face struggles every day and no one sees that side of things. \"It's really upsetting that people just write her off because everyone who knows Maddie loves her and knows how great she is, people on the street say 'hiya' to her before me because she's so popular.\" Maddie's autism means she communicates and expresses her emotions differently to others. But Cassie said this is no reason for her daughter to miss out on things other children get to do. Cassie said the riding school had been willing to take the booking when Maddie's dad, Danny Brockley, had called on March 23. But things changed when they learnt of Maddie's autism, Cassie claims. She said: \"Maddie's dad called up first and spoke to someone and it was all fine but when he mentioned she had autism they said they couldn't do it. \"They said it should be no problem until he explained that Maddie has autism and she might get excited when she sees the horses, and then they said she couldn't come. \"Maddie stims which means she flaps her arms and makes noises when she gets excited but that's just how she reacts and she shouldn't be treated differently to anyone else.\" The mum-of-three added: \"What upset me the most was how dismissive they were, it's like they heard the word autism and made their minds up. \"They kept asking 'how bad is it? How bad is her autism?,' But it's not bad, autism isn't something bad it's just different. \"I just want my little girl to be able to do what she enjoys.\" The devastated mum added she would not have allowed her daughter on a horse if it wasn't safe. But Sychdyn Riding School said they needed different insurance to work with Maddie safely, and recommended Clwyd Special Riding Centre, which specialises in riding for people with additional needs. A spokesperson said: \"We're just trying to stick within the rules that have been given to us, and there are places available which are specifically set up for people with different needs.\" On the insurance explanation, she said: \"They did come back after and explain to me about the insurance, but the thing that hurt me was the way they approached it, because it felt like she was just being told no because of her autism. \"In this day and age, people who were born with disabilities are still not treated the same and not able to do the same things as other people.\" She added: \"We have spoken to other parents with ASD and did consider others but we ended up going to a riding school in Flintshire, which doesn't specialise in disabilities.

      "Oliver Harta's parents Nik and Sheryl, provided evidence of his learning difficulties and proof of a specialist bus he uses to go on his work experience run by the authority An autistic man has been stripped of his free travel pass in a move that his mum has slammed as 'absolute nonsense'. Oliver Harta has been told he no longer qualifies for a 'Freedom Pass' which allows him to travel across London for free. His family are desperately trying to fight for it to be reinstated after being told it would be revoked. The 20-year-old from Harrow, north west London, was told the news despite being given the pass which was valid until 2026. A letter from Harrow Council said Oliver's disability meant he was no longer qualified for it. Oliver's parents Nik and Sheryl, provided evidence of his learning difficulties and proof of a specialist bus he uses to go on his work experience, which is run by the authority. Sheryl said the council is insisting that she provides a letter from the NHS which explicitly outlines Oliver\u2019s condition. She told MyLondon the council was making things more difficult for her family. Sheryl said: \u201cMy son is almost 21 and he\u2019s studying entry level maths and English. He doesn\u2019t have any GCSEs, he attends a specialist college. \"It\u2019s quite obvious that his autism impairs his social interaction. I really don\u2019t understand it and it\u2019s quite upsetting for us. How can the council just move the goalposts and say \u2018having autism isn\u2019t enough\u2019 anymore?\u201d She explained how she told Oliver that he might have to use a bank card to travel on the bus, which he was confused about as it was a break from his regular routine. Sheryl said: \u201cIt caused quite a stir and got him into a bit of a fluster as it\u2019s something he\u2019s not used to. He just kept asking \u2018why?\u2019 and saying \u2018I\u2019ve never had to do that before\u2019.\u201d Sheryl has been in contact with the council, who put her in touch with a private company that manages the Freedom Pass applications in Harrow. She said the people making these decisions are not aware of the specific circumstances that affect each applicant and she thinks they are using a one size fits all checklist. She added: \u201cI\u2019ve submitted loads of information, including his education and health care plan but they don\u2019t want to know. They say we\u2019ve got to have this specific piece of paper and getting hold of that could take up to a year - it\u2019s wasting precious time. \"It\u2019s an absolute nonsense.\u201d Sheryl said the council is making things more difficult for her family in a situation where, if anything, they should be given more support.

We often spoke about how we would change the world once she was well enough to help me. She hated the system and how it was failing everyone around her.\u201d Lindsey says the NHS Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) and adult mental health teams failed to provide appropriate community support for her daughter who was struggling with day to day life and her grief after the death of her younger brother when she was eight-years-old. Lindsey, an integrated urgent care health advisor and hair extensionist, from Bournemouth said: \u201cLauren first asked for help dealing with her mental health when she was 14 and when no support came her struggle escalated. She had severe anxiety and OCD. She also had Asperger\u2019s but wasn\u2019t diagnosed until she was 17. \u201cThe opportunity for early intervention was missed for Lauren. If there was more support available when we first asked for it I believe things would never have got so bad. \u201cLauren has had to put up with a lot in her short life. When she was just eight years old, her little brother, Alfie died from Mitochondrial disease, she watched him suffer for two and a half years. \u201cHer OCD rituals were often about protecting her family.\u201d Lauren first went into a psychiatric unit voluntarily on 31 Oct 2018 to receive therapy. But her mum says after a few weeks no therapy materialised and without a plan in place Lauren became very frustrated, felt trapped and her self-harming got progressively worse. Lindsey said: \u201cShe would self harm while she was being watched by the healthcare professionals, much more than we could ever have imagined and more severe than we had seen before. \u201cLauren was missing her family so much and got worse simply by being in hospital and not having any treatment.\u201d From October 2018 to February 2022 Lauren was an inpatient at six facilities. Lindsey said: \u201cFor years she has been locked away, often not seeing daylight or offered exercise for weeks on end, with no plan to meet her needs psychiatrically. And little or no therapy or therapeutic activities to stimulate her. \u201cIt was a battle to make sure her basic human rights were being met on a daily basis. On occasions, due to Lauren\u2019s frustration of the system and being locked away 24/7 she has been sent to an adult unit and put in total seclusion without even a bed, just a ground sheet to sleep on. \u201cShe deserved the best and sadly was ripped away from her family time and time again and placed in settings that were like torture for her. \u201cShe\u2019s been treated worse than a criminal at times. All we wanted was the correct care and treatment package to allow her to come home for good, with me, where she belongs instead we had to make do with short contact visits and two video calls a day.\u201d Lindsey says Lauren was a straight A student who aspired to be a doctor or a paediatric nurse. She added: \u201cLauren and I were exceptionally close. Our bond was absolutely unbreakable. We were massively failed by the mental health system. \u201cRight now over 2000 people with a Learning Disability and/or Autism remain locked in inpatient units. \u201cOften they are far from family and at an increased risk of abuse. Lauren was one of these people. \u201cTogether we have been fighting for the correct care and treatment package but sadly it didn\u2019t come quick enough. \u201cAfter being detained under the mental health act and sent to a unit six hours away in Manchester in June last year Lauren\u2019s mental health declined rapidly. \u201cShe suffered terribly from separation anxiety and hated being so far away from me. \u201cIt broke her and our little family. She wasn\u2019t just my daughter, she was my best friend. \u201cShe passed away on Thursday 24th February after her heart stopped beating for well over an hour. Doctors kept her alive until 11.32am on 26th February 2022 to see if she could be a suitable organ donor. \u201cNow she has gone to join her baby brother Alfie in Heaven but she leaves behind her other brother Bobby, her Grandparents, her dad, James, uncles and aunties, godparents, special friends, girlfriend and her very special cousins. \u201cHer beautiful smile, kind heart and pure courage and strength touched the hearts of everyone who met her.\u201d In memory of Lauren, Lindsey is proposing the introduction of some changes to significantly enhance the lives of vulnerable children and young adults who are being detained under the mental health act. Lindsey's petition has attracted over 5000 signatures already. Lindsey said: \u201cNo children or adults with autism should be detained under the mental health act or sent to psychiatric hospitals out of area, far away from home. \u201cNo child or adult should be left in an unsuitable hospital setting that is detrimental for their well-being. \u201cLauren was left alone, far from home, in an environment that was causing more harm than good. \u201cI believe if my proposals were already in place, my daughter would still be alive.\u201d \u201cWe would like to express our sincere condolences to Lauren\u2019s family and friends at this difficult time. A Dorset HealthCare spokesperson said: \u201cWhile we cannot comment on individual circumstances, we can say that we do endeavour to support all patients who are being cared for by our mental health services and in the community so they can lead safe and fulfilling lives. Where patients or their families feel they have not received the support they expect we work with them and do our best to address their concerns \u201cOut-of-area placements are always used only as a last resort by services, either when we are at full capacity or when a person has very complex needs and requires specialist care not available within Dorset.

      "Five Acre Wood, a special school in Maidstone, Kent, has admitted to breaking its own policies and government guidelines by repeatedly strapping two autistic twins, Samuel and Jacob Montague, into chairs to restrict their movement A school that repeatedly strapped two autistic students into chairs to restrict their movement has apologised after a court ruled it breached their human rights. Five Acre Wood, a school for children with special education needs, has admitted breaking its own policy and government guidance by using mechanical restraints on twins Samuel and Jacob Montague. The twins, who are both severely autistic and non-verbal, started at the school in 2009 aged four, with the intention of attending until age 19. They are now both 17. But their parents Annie and Mark pulled them out in 2013 after realising staff were strapping the boys into chairs despite objections and protests. Kent County Council, which runs the school in Maidstone, has offered their parents more than \u00a380,000 compensation after a civil court case. Now Annie and Mark are calling for changes to the law to make it clearer the restraints should not be used against children like Samuel and Jacob. In a statement issued after the settlement, they said: \"Children with special educational needs should be protected, not strapped into chairs. \"It has been a long, difficult process, but it has been our privilege to be the voice for Samuel and Jacob. \"They, and other children with autism or learning disabilities, deserve the full protection of the law. \"Local authorities should be on their side, empowering their lives, instead of using restrictive practices like restraints that can cause trauma and harm. \"Now that the case is over, and Samuel and Jacob are safe and thriving, we look forward to campaigning to stop the use of restraints against children with special educational needs.\" The first public incident took place in 2010, when the boys were wheeled out at a school concert strapped into the 'Hardrock' chairs. The chairs restrain movement through a number of straps that go around legs, arms, and shoulders. When their parents protested, they were told the mechanical restraint chairs were the only way the boys could participate in the concert and their use was a one-off. Despite this, the couple became concerned that Samuel and Jacob were being routinely restrained while at the school. And in June 2011, a clinical psychologist visited and witnessed one of the boys strapped into the Hardrock chairs in the classroom. On one occasion the boys' mother and their carer attended a school sports day where other children were outside and running around. But Jacob was strapped into the chair and visibly distressed. The boys' autism means they interpret the world through touch and movement, so the use of the chairs completely undermined their human rights, Annie and Mark argued. After they took Samuel and Jacob out of the school, they home-schooled them and the boys have since flourished. The couple brought a civil case under the Human Rights Act against the council.

      "Five Acre Wood, a special school in Maidstone, Kent, has admitted to breaking its own policies and government guidelines by repeatedly strapping two autistic twins, Samuel and Jacob Montague, into chairs to restrict their movement A school that repeatedly strapped two autistic students into chairs to restrict their movement has apologised after a court ruled it breached their human rights. Five Acre Wood, a school for children with special education needs, has admitted breaking its own policy and government guidance by using mechanical restraints on twins Samuel and Jacob Montague. The twins, who are both severely autistic and non-verbal, started at the school in 2009 aged four, with the intention of attending until age 19. They are now both 17. But their parents Annie and Mark pulled them out in 2013 after realising staff were strapping the boys into chairs despite objections and protests. Kent County Council, which runs the school in Maidstone, has offered their parents more than \u00a380,000 compensation after a civil court case. Now Annie and Mark are calling for changes to the law to make it clearer the restraints should not be used against children like Samuel and Jacob. In a statement issued after the settlement, they said: \"Children with special educational needs should be protected, not strapped into chairs. \"It has been a long, difficult process, but it has been our privilege to be the voice for Samuel and Jacob. \"They, and other children with autism or learning disabilities, deserve the full protection of the law. \"Local authorities should be on their side, empowering their lives, instead of using restrictive practices like restraints that can cause trauma and harm. \"Now that the case is over, and Samuel and Jacob are safe and thriving, we look forward to campaigning to stop the use of restraints against children with special educational needs.\" The first public incident took place in 2010, when the boys were wheeled out at a school concert strapped into the 'Hardrock' chairs. The chairs restrain movement through a number of straps that go around legs, arms, and shoulders. When their parents protested, they were told the mechanical restraint chairs were the only way the boys could participate in the concert and their use was a one-off. Despite this, the couple became concerned that Samuel and Jacob were being routinely restrained while at the school. And in June 2011, a clinical psychologist visited and witnessed one of the boys strapped into the Hardrock chairs in the classroom. On one occasion the boys' mother and their carer attended a school sports day where other children were outside and running around. But Jacob was strapped into the chair and visibly distressed. The boys' autism means they interpret the world through touch and movement, so the use of the chairs completely undermined their human rights, Annie and Mark argued. After they took Samuel and Jacob out of the school, they home-schooled them and the boys have since flourished. The couple brought a civil case under the Human Rights Act against the council. They argued the restraints had been used unlawfully as the school failed to consider less restrictive options and failed to put in place a plan to reduce the use of restraints. The school admitted a raft of failings and admitted the use of straps and trays on the specialist chairs could restrict movement and amount to mechanical restraint.

      "Leyla Gallagher, 10, from Leeds, craves friendship and loves people, but her autism, ADHD and Pathological Demand Avoidance (PDA) make social interactions and everyday expectations difficult for her A ten-year-old girl has been rejected by every school she has applied for, leaving her \"desperate for friendship\" and \"feeling different\", her mum has said. Daniella Gallagher, 39 has said her daughter Leyla is \"big and bold\" and should not be hindered by the conditions that affect her. Leyla has autism, ADHD and Pathological Demand Avoidance (PDA) which makes social interactions and everyday expectations difficult for her. She has been out of school since June 2021, with local mainstream schools in Leeds finding it difficult to place her, Leeds Live reports. Daniella said : \"It's been hell for Leyla. She's socially isolated. \"A lot of Autistic people have special interests - Leyla's special interest is people. \"She's desperate for friendships. She's a 10-year-old girl that is full of life, energy. \"She's big and bold, has a great sense of humour, and is a fantastic character. \"She's desperate for friends but she can't maintain friendships well because she's not in a school environment where she can meet and see friends regularly. \"Leyla is of an age now where she's aware she's different and obviously that has a huge impact on her and her self-esteem. \"She hasn't identified how she fits in yet and who she is as a person and tried to copy other people. \"It's such a difficult time for her and she isn't in a school environment where she can work out who she is.\" Leyla was previously in mainstream education but began to struggle from around year one onwards. In 2019, she was diagnosed with Autism and ADHD, and Daniella started looking at alternative provisions Leyla could attend. She found her a place at a partnership school with an attached provision to start in January 2020. In December 2020, Leyla had PDA traits added to her diagnosis by CAMHS. Leyla's time at the alternative provision started off well, but she was affected by lockdowns, and quickly became anxious as before. In June 2021, the school admitted it couldn't meet her needs. Daniella said: \"Mainstream schools just looked at her as 'that naughty child'. \"While she was in mainstream schooling she was locked in classrooms when she was having meltdowns before she was diagnosed,\" Daniella said. \"She was running out of school with no shoes on onto main roads when she just seven years old. \"Getting her into school was a nightmare. The anxiety was so high, I'd have to peel her off railings. \"If I was successful I'd get a phone call within half an hour that she'd run out or had a meltdown. \"Even once she joined her new specialist provision in 2020, her anxiety got to the point of being through the roof - at that point, it was just impossible. \"She was trying to escape and abscond all the time.\" Since then, Leyla has been at home and out of full-time education while Daniella has desperately been trying to find somewhere that can accommodate Leyla. In the time since the summer, both Leeds City Council and Daniella have been contacting provisions across Leeds to see if they can fulfil her needs as per her Education, Health and Care Plan (EHC). EHCs set out the specific needs of children with special educational needs in order to provide the support those children need. But so far, every single provision has said no - Daniella estimates Leyla has been rejected by 10-12 schools in the local authority area. One primary school said it could potentially meet Leyla's needs - but it has no space until 2023, by which point she will nearly have aged out of primary education. Daniella added: \"Leyla doesn't get the chance to experience lots of different peer groups and social interactions. \"We try to do lots of different activities, climbing, swimming, and more but she ends up stuck with me all the time. \"She's run away before, she's been bullied, she's been hit by people claiming to be her friends, she gets horrible messages. \"She's quite an intense person who doesn't really understand social boundaries all the time and that can make her very vulnerable for being bullied. It's really hard for her.\" According to Daniella, the reason Leyla has been refused many alternative provisions is that she is often too academic to fit in with the peer groups. Daniella also said she has had a \"nightmare\" trying to get hold of someone to speak to at the local authority since autumn 2021 to discuss suitable schools. She has since made an official complaint. The school Leyla was at until June 2021 have helped sort out a six to 12-week placement at a provision at another school in the area. But the provision isn't permanent as a solution. \"It's heartbreaking for me. She's my baby and I want her to be happy. I know she will be amazing at whatever she does when she finds herself,\" Daniella said. \"She's a very strong, resilient, creative young girl and she's going to do amazing. Leyla changes and educates people all around her because she's that type of character. \"She will do amazing once she finds the place she fits in. It's hard to watch your child struggle so much. \"The gaps in her learning are just growing and growing and that's becoming more apparent as she gets older. \"I do worry about her future but I will help her do whatever she needs to do to get her GCSEs, whether she wants to do them later in life. \"My expectations for her currently are more around focusing on her social and emotional wellbeing.\" She added she was saddened by the fact that there are no options for children like her daughter. Daniella said: \"I can't make a school happen by clicking my fingers - there just seems to be nowhere out there for children like Leyla with PDA. \"There's very little knowledge in this area around the condition. We're lucky to have really good support groups in the area as there's also very little official support. \"I'm a single mum with two kids and they take up every second of my life. \"That can impact my own mental health - it's not easy. I used to work at a school but I had to leave my job because of all this. \"You don't realise until you're in this situation how dire it is. Even just trying to get a bit of help and support from anybody is impossible.\" A Leeds City Council spokesperson said: \u201cWhilst we are not able to comment on individual cases, the local authority is committed to work in partnership with parents and in the best interests of children. \"We strive to meet the provision needs of children with SEND and aspirations of parents and we take the concerns of parents seriously. \u201cPDA is a clinical diagnosis and therefore we are led by our clinical partners in their use of diagnostic terminology. \"Our statutory processes, consultation with specialist and mainstream settings and provision offer is not restricted by a diagnostic framework. \u201cWe endeavour to work restoratively with all families to ensure children with SEND meet their aspirations and outcomes.

      "Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition with potentially 'devastating' consequences - but families affected have felt largely 'unsupported' Health watchdog NICE has revealed a \u201clandmark\u201d initiative today to vastly improve the care of those exposed to alcohol in the womb. Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) affects around 3% of the UK population - three times as many as autism - yet more than half of Brits (53%) have never heard of the condition. FASD is a neurodevelopmental condition that arises from alcohol exposure in the womb, with 428 associated conditions linked to \u201cdevastating consequences\u201d - from brain damage to physical and developmental issues. Today, The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) said that any child thought to have been exposed should be given an assessment. Any child confirmed to have been exposed should be sent for a neurodevelopmental assessment, and those confirmed to have FASD should be given a management plan for their needs. It also said women should be given early advice not to drink in their pregnancy, and have their alcohol consumption noted on records. This is part of a 20-year fight by campaigners and families living with FASD, who feel they have been largely \u201cunsupported\u201d. The spokeswoman for National Organisation for FASD, Joanna Buckard, said: \u201cThe NICE Quality Standard is a major leap forward in the fight to reduce alcohol-exposed pregnancies by giving women the information and support they need and, vitally, to create brighter futures for those with FASD and their families. \u201cToo many people with FASD up to now have been left undiagnosed and unsupported, with sometimes devastating and avoidable consequences.\u201d Professor Raja Mukherjee, who heads the FASD National Specialist Clinic and was on the NICE Quality Standard Committee, said: \u201cFASD is a complex condition which affects brain and body. \u201cThere are over 428 conditions linked to FASD, and it presents in multiple ways. \u201cBut in terms of recognition, we\u2019re about 20 years behind other conditions like autism or ADHD. \u201cI hope it does not take so long going forward to implement the improvements outlined in the NICE Quality Standard, and make the real difference that people with FASD deserve.\u201d Despite 2.4 million people thought to have FASD in the UK, compared to the 1 million people estimated to be living with autism, the majority of Brits (66%) have heard of autism. A third (32%) who knew about FASD didn't know how many people were living with it, while almost half (46%) estimated the figures to be lower than it is. It comes as research, carried out by OnePoll, on behalf of the National Organisation for FASD, found nearly a quarter of adults think it\u2019s okay to have alcohol during pregnancy - which goes against the Chief Medical Officer's advice that it is safest to avoid it. What is happening where you live? Find out by adding your postcode. Jan Griffin, from Surrey, whose 20-year-old son Rossi has FASD, opened up about her experience. She said: \u201cI didn\u2019t have any issues with alcohol. I was just an ordinary 40-year-old woman living my best life as it were. \u201cHad anybody said to me, when I was thinking of having a sleeping tablet or a tot of brandy to de-stress, \u201cdid you know alcohol kills cells as they migrate in the baby?\u201d, I\u2019d have sat up and made different decisions. \u201cI wish someone had said - this is what happens, these are the facts, the choice is yours, you\u2019re not being judged. \u201cWe cannot change the history of FASD, but with this long-awaited NICE Quality Standard we WILL change futures.\u201d Rossi said: \u201cI\u2019m very forgetful, oftentimes I have trouble socialising and sometimes it\u2019s a comfort issue - I may get back or leg pains.\u201d Clare Devanney-Glynn, adoptive mum to three with FASD, who also sat on the NICE Quality Standard Committee, said: \u201cThanks to this, my children and others just like them will be able to enter adulthood being understood by society in a way that just hasn\u2019t ever happened before. \u201cThis has the capacity to change what our entire society looks like for the better.\u201d Get email updates with the day's biggest stories ",

But, Helen says she knows whoever left it has \"absolutely no life\". Get email updates with the day's biggest stories ",
      "The little boy, four, has been barred from Prince Avenue Academy and Nursery in Southend, Essex, for 30 days because he had been \"violent towards staff\" and \"dangerous with scissors\", the school claims A mum who thinks her son could be autistic has blasted his school for removing him from lessons five times in six months. The four-year-old boy has been a pupil at Prince Avenue Academy and Nursery in Southend, Essex since September last year. He was suspended four times before his most recent punishment - a month-long \"temporary exclusion\" which started on January 29. His mum - who says she feels \"emotionally drained\" from the lack of support - claims she is yet to be told when he can return. The lad was excluded because he was \"being violent towards staff\" and had been \"dangerous with scissors\", reports say. The working mum claims she made staff aware her boy could be on the autistic spectrum and that he \"gets frustrated and struggles with his emotions\". She told the Echo: \u201cI have to accommodate the school so much and I have said from the start my son needs structure and routine and since all of this over the last six month, it has made his emotional wellbeing worse, which then affects his behaviour. \u201cIt has made me emotionally drained and alone as it feels like no one is supporting me or him, and it is so upsetting to see my son feel that no one in the school likes him, he is down, unhappy, and it breaks my heart.\u201d The boy made significant progress with his emotions after teachers provided additional support at his pre-school, his mum claims. She added: \u201cThis school has let me down, if he had the right one on one support going forward, he would been absolutely fine, but instead I get told \u2018it takes a lot to deal with him\u2019.\u201d Responding to the mum's complaint, headteacher Gary Clement told the Mirror that out of the 500 students at the school, just one has been \"temporarily excluded\". Mr Clement said: \u201cWe work hard to ensure that all the children feel valued and respected and enjoy learning in a safe, happy environment. \u201cIn fact, Ofsted described our efforts to promote the development and welfare of pupils as \u2018outstanding\u2019, which I am incredibly proud of. In very exceptional circumstances we use short \u2018fixed-term exclusion\u2019. \u201cFor context, in a school of almost 500, we currently have one child temporarily excluded. \u201cWhile it would not be appropriate to talk about the specific circumstances, what I can say is that we have specially trained staff who have been working closely with the local authority\u2019s inclusion team and the family. We continue to work to find a sensible and satisfactory resolution.\u201d Get email updates with the day's biggest stories ",

      "Lorna Hewitt, 43, and Craig, 42, were each sentenced to six years behind bars after they were found guilty of falsely imprisoning Matthew Langley, 22, at their home in Sheffield, South Yorkshire A mum and stepdad who locked their autistic son in an attic where he was found \"close to death\" have been jailed today Lorna Hewitt, 43, and her husband Craig, 42, were each sentenced to six years behind bars after they were found guilty of falsely imprisoning Matthew Langley, 22, at their home in Sheffield, South Yorkshire. Matthew was severely dehydrated and weighed just six stone - or 36 kilos - when he was found inside the vomit and faeces-covered room. Judge Michael Slater, described Lorna Hewitt's actions as \"a grave abuse of trust between a mother and her son\" sentencing at Sheffield Crown Court on Friday. He added: \"You were the primary carer for Matthew with all his difficulties and challenges. \"It makes it all the more inexplicable to me that for those seven months you failed to provide him with the support and provision of food and drink that he craved and needed.\" The Hewitts had earlier denied keeping Matthew captive at their home for seven months, but a jury found them both guilty. The couple were also found guilty of causing or allowing a vulnerable adult to suffer serious physical harm. Matthew was found by paramedics seriously underweight, dehydrated and \"with his life hanging in the balance\", the court heard. Nicholas Campbell QC, prosecuting, previously said the ambulance service was called to the home in Sheffield, South Yorks., in the early hours of June 2, 2020. Matthew was rushed to a hospital intensive care unit in a \"pitiable state\" with abrasions indicating he had been moving around on all fours, the prosecutor told the court. He had suffered damage to a kidney with high sodium levels relating to severe dehydration, it was heard. Mr Campbell added: \"His sodium levels were dangerously high. They measured 180. \"They were so high they could shut down his brain and kill him. Anything above 145, there is a real chance of death. \"The Home Office pathologist examined the injuries and said the abrasions and bruises were consistent in his view with Matthew having been crawling on all fours over objects in his path.\" When police went into the attic they found faeces and vomit all over the floor and the bedding, and it was swarming with buzzing flies, the court heard. Police also found a key on the outside of the door, it was said. Matthew, who has suffered from irritable bowel syndrome, incontinence, arthritis and learning difficulties, had weighed only six stone when he was found, Mr Campbell said. In November 2019, just seven months prior, he had weighed eight-and-a-half stone, the court heard. Seven months earlier, in November 2019, he had weighed eight-and-a-half stone, the court heard. Thanks to the hard of medical professionals, Matthew made a good physical recovery and was discharged from the hospital weights 8.6 stone. In mitigation, John Harrison, for Lorna Hewitt, read a report from psychologist Rekha Davis that said she was \"vulnerable to manipulation and exploitation\" and was \"easily suggestible\". The report stated, he said: \"Given her emotional vulnerability, Mrs Hewitt's capacity to consider the consequences of her actions and decisions is limited.\" Miss Tana Adkin QC, representing Mr Craig Hewitt, said there had been a \"significant change\" in his understanding of what he had done throughout the court proceedings. She said: \"He is devastated about what happened to Mathew. He is not a deliberately cruel man in the sense that the courts see and have seen in the past. \"He is not someone that would punish Matthew for his autism.\" What crimes have been reported in your neighbourhood? Check with In Your Area. However, Judge Slater disagreed with these characterisations as he sentenced the pair behind bars. Addressing Craig Hewitt, the judge said: \"You were complicit equally with wife Lorna Hewitt in care effectively-being switched off to any degree for Matthew as he was locked in his room and starved of food. \"That did not occur by negligence, it did not occur by recklessness. \"It was a plan between the pair of you. I'm quite satisfied that nothing in that household occurred without either you knowing about it or approving of it.\" Speaking directly to Lorna Hewitt, he said: \"It is argued on your behalf that you were particularly vulnerable and suggestible at the time.\" \"I had the benefit of observing you give evidence in the trial over the course of several days. \"It did not seem to me that you were not capable of standing up for yourself or that you were particularly suggestible.

      "Residents living above Faith in Strangers in Margate, Kent, were unaware that the venue would eventually become a live music venue on weekend evenings, they claim The parents of a two-year-old autistic boy have claimed they have been forced to move out of their apartment due to the \u201cnightclub\u201d below blasting loud music into the early hours. Residents living above Faith in Strangers in Margate, Kent, were unaware that the venue, which was originally a creative co-working space that hosted poetry nights and academic talks, would eventually become a live music venue on weekend evenings. But after lockdown, residents of the block of 12 flats above the venue have claimed weekends have become a \u201cnightmare\u201d with bosses having revealed that it could become a live music venue on Fridays and Saturdays. And a mum-of-two, Rosie-Mae Deal, told how she has been brought to tears by the \u201cridiculously loud\u201d music that was causing a huge amount of distress to her autistic son. \u201cOne night I sat crying in my home knowing I can\u2019t do anything about this ridiculously loud music thumping through my flat, waking my children up, upsetting my little boy, who has autism so is very sensitive to sounds,\" she said. \u201cHe sleeps in my bed because he\u2019s scared. He covers his ears, he cries, he screams under his covers.\u201d Rosie-Mae said the family should be able to feel \u201csafe and at peace\u201d in their own home. Another elderly resident, Ethelbert Crescent, has suggested the noise is bad due to it not having the correct soundproofing to manage the loud music. Ethelbert, who is in her 80s, explained that the blaring noise is affecting her health and had prompted her to avoid staying in her own home. When Georgina Powell and her partner moved into an apartment in the same block of flats, , they had been drawn to the idea of the arts hub that they could use on their doorstep. Georgina said that the concept of the space had sounded \u201camazing\u201d. But now, she and her partner - whose flat is directly above the venue - have now been forced to move out, and are now paying rent on top of their mortgage. Georgina compared parties held in the flat to the noise held in Fabric nightclub, with the floor vibrating and the couple able to hear \u201cevery word to Madonna\u201d. Various noise complaints were logged by the Thanet District Council last year, prompting an application to review the licence to be submitted.

      "Billy Baxter, 16, from Blackburn, needed life-saving surgery after being knifed in the heart and lungs and now has a 12-inch scar running down the length of his chest An autistic teen who stayed inside his home for over 2 years due to social anxiety was brutally stabbed while venturing out for just the second time. Billy Baxter, 16, from Blackburn, was knifed in the heart and lungs on the evening of September 17 last year while walking near his home in what is believed to be a row over a girl. He had to undergo life-saving surgery after the attack and has since been left with a 12-inch scar running down the length of his chest. His mum Jessie Brian, 35, found out about the attack when Billy messaged her on Snapchat to say he was on his way to hospital. She said the teen had been left traumatised by the incident and the family now plans to move out of the area. His 17 year-old attacker - who cannot be named for legal reasons - was sentenced to just 28 months in custody for the offence last week. He was originally charged with attempted murder but this was downgraded to wounding with intent by the Crown Prosecution Service. Jessie hit out at the sentence, calling it a \"slap on the wrist\" while Billy had been forced to turn his back on his life and ambitions. \"Billy wanted to be a plumber and now he's too scared to go out of the house just when he got his confidence back,\" she said. \"It's heart-breaking what he's done to my son, and in court, he held his head up high like nothing had happened. \"I've been around this area for 35 years - it's the only area that I've known - and now we have to leave because the attacker knows my address and so does his family.\" Billy has ADHD and autism and had spent more than two years without leaving his girlfriend's house due to his lifelong developmental disability. But they broke up shortly before the attack on September 17 last year and Billy moved back home with Jessie. He was ambushed after leaving the house at around 6.45pm to meet up with a new love interest. Jessie said: \"He'd been in a relationship, and he'd found out she was cheating on him, so he came back home after isolating with her for two and a half years. \"I said to Billy, \"Just get out there! You need to start socialising with people and making new friends. Forget about everything that's happened.\" \"So he'd met this young girl, and managed to get to town and to see her, but then he heard his name being shouted across the road. \"He put his hood down and didn't want any trouble, but next thing he knew the lad was in front of his face, and he got stabbed straight in the chest.\" Jessie said she found out about the stabbing after Billy contacted her over messaging platform Snapchat in the minutes after it took place. She said: \"I got a phone call from one of his friends on Snapchat, and it was actually Billy on the phone saying that he had been stabbed. \"I thought it was someone having a joke because it didn't sound like Billy. \"It was only when he said: \"It is me, mum, I've been stabbed and I'm on my way to the hospital,\" that's when I found out.\" Billy was rushed to hospital where he required a life-saving operation after doctors found out he had internal bleeding. Jessie said: \"He was stabbed in the chest, between his heart and his liver. \"It pierced his heart, as well as cutting through a tube that runs from his heart for the blood supply, and slashing his liver. \"They had to open him up and pull his rib cage back and do an operation on his heart, and they had to repair the tube as well. \"It was an operation that he had to have within 24 hours - a life-saving operation - because he had internal bleeding as well, which is very, very dangerous.\" She added: \"It was a nightmare to tell you the truth, it really was a nightmare.\" Billy was left with a huge scar running down his chest, along with a couple of smaller ones dotted just above his stomach. But Jessie said that the poor lad was also left with mental trauma, which continues to this day. She said: \"My 16-year-old who wanted to go to college and be a plumber hasn't got a life now because he won't go out.\" \"He feels very conscious about the scars. He talks about it every single day. It's not just one little scar. It's one big massive scar and two scars underneath it.\" Jessie also feels the sentence that her son's attacker received won't deter other kids from carrying knives in the future. She said: \"28 months is a slap on the hand. This boy who did all this will probably get out and get a job or whatever, and my son is left not knowing what to do next.\" Get email updates with the day's biggest stories ",

Jessie said: \"He was stabbed in the chest, between his heart and his liver. \"It pierced his heart, as well as cutting through a tube that runs from his heart for the blood supply, and slashing his liver. \"They had to open him up and pull his rib cage back and do an operation on his heart, and they had to repair the tube as well. \"It was an operation that he had to have within 24 hours - a life-saving operation - because he had internal bleeding as well, which is very, very dangerous.\" She added: \"It was a nightmare to tell you the truth, it really was a nightmare.\" Billy was left with a huge scar running down his chest, along with a couple of smaller ones dotted just above his stomach. But Jessie said that the poor lad was also left with mental trauma, which continues to this day. She said: \"My 16-year-old who wanted to go to college and be a plumber hasn't got a life now because he won't go out.\" \"He feels very conscious about the scars. He talks about it every single day. It's not just one little scar. It's one big massive scar and two scars underneath it.\" Jessie also feels the sentence that her son's attacker received won't deter other kids from carrying knives in the future. She said: \"28 months is a slap on the hand. This boy who did all this will probably get out and get a job or whatever, and my son is left not knowing what to do next.\" Get email updates with the day's biggest stories ",
      "Jada Braxton, 17, was diagnosed with autism when she was seven after her mum Danisha noticed changes to her behaviour and an intense need to stick to a routine. But the devoted mum has never let autism hold her daughter back A teen with autism has been crowned a beauty queen - after judges saw just a photograph of her. Jada Braxton, 17, won the Miss Photogenic title at the Miss Saraland pageant in her home state of Alabama, US. Diagnosed with autism aged seven, she struggles to look people in the eye and submitted her entry to the pageant with a stunning photo of herself beaming. Now wearing her title with pride, Jada wants other autistic girls to know \"that they have a voice.\" After her daughter's big win, Jada's mum Danisha said the verdict was \"outstanding\" given that the judges only used a photo of her. She said: \"By her winning Miss Photogenic, she is a face now to autism. \"This is autism, this is what autism looks like.\" For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here Proud Danisha also wrote about Jada's success on Instagram, posting a heartfelt message to her daughter. She wrote: \"You refuse to be labelled. You refuse to be held to limits.\" Danisha added she reckoned the judges would be \"shocked\" if they knew the person they'd chosen as Miss Photogenic had special needs. She recalled a chat she'd had with Jada about entering a beauty pageant in a heartwarming exchange. Danisha reported her daughter said: \"Mom I want other autistic girls to know that they can do this too.\" Describing her daughter as a \"shining light,\" she praised Jada for showing people that those living with special needs \"just want to be included and accepted.\" She wrote: \"You are truly LOVE. You are an inspiration to so many people. You do not let your autism stop you from dreaming and achieving. It is such an honour and a blessing to be your mum. \"The outpouring love and support that she has received this past week has been AMAZING. From the bottom of our hearts... Jada and I thank you all.\" After Jada was crowned Miss Photogenic, Danisha also wrote an essay on autismspeaks.com called, 'Jada B: Shattering misconceptions in the autism community.' In the essay, she wrote: \"Jada... knows that she is more than just a girl with autism.\" Recalling what her daughter was like as a tot, Danisha said Jada knew all her colours and could count to 100 before starting school.

      "Kelly McEvatt, 38, posted on her local Facebook group to try and find the 'angel' who helped her son Nathan, who has autism A mum was blown away by a kind stranger who helped her 12-year-old son at a bus stop. Kelly McEvatt, 38, from Speke, Liverpool posted on a local Facebook group to try and find the 'absolute angel' who helped her son, Nathan, on his way to school on Monday, January 24. After saying goodbye to his mother, Nathan reached the bus stop where the school bus was already there. Kelly claims he knocked on the side of the bus but the driver drove away, leaving him behind. Nathan, who has autism, then became panicked and upset, Liverpool Echo reports. His mother said: \"He went to get his school bus as normal and the bus driver didn't wait for him. He was banging on the window and he drive off. \"Nathan started to panic, he has a lot of anxiety because of his autism and when he was upset trying to figure out what to do a woman stepped in and started talking to him.\" The woman, who was also at the bus stop, tried to stop the bus from leaving Nathan behind. When the bus drove away, she gave him \u00a32 to get a public bus as he only had enough money for his normal school bus. Kelly said: \"Nathan rang me and told me what happened, he asked if he could get the [public] bus and I was nervous because he has only ever got the school bus before. \"I asked him if he knew where to get off and he did it. He got to school all on his own for the first time. \"When he got home he was buzzing that he got to school on his own. \"I can't thank the lady enough for what she did. It's amazing to know people are there to help my boy when he needs it.\" Writing in the Speke Past & Present Facebook group, she said: \"Just want to thank the lovely lady that gave my son money to get a bus to school this morning after his school bus failed to stop for him. \"My son is autistic and was quite panicked but thanks to you and some guidance by us on the phone, he made it to school all by himself. \"You have no idea how much this will do for his confidence and independence. You're an absolute angel.\" The woman, Pamela Fox, saw the post and commented: \"Ahh this was me I've been thinking about him all day!! I tried to stop the bus when I seen him running but the bus just went!! \"I could see he was panicking and I'm so happy that he got to school okay. I had a little chat with him, he's a lovely little boy and reminds me so much of my son who is also in the same year just a different school. So glad he's okay.\" Get email updates with the day's biggest stories ",
      "Coroner rules there were \"basic failings\" in the care of a six-year-old, who died of a rare kidney condition The tragic death of a six-year-old girl following a catologue of \"basic failures\" in her care has led to \"sweeping changes\", at a hospital trust. Tragic Coco Bradford lost her life after \"several opportunities\" were missed by doctors and consultants to help her, an inquest heard. This included failing to order basic blood and stool samples or offering her a simple course of intravenous fluids to rehydrate her. The tot, who had autism, was even 'blamed' by medical staff for being uncooperative. Coco, 6, died from multiple organ failure on July 31, 2017, caused by an aggressive form of Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS), a rare kidney condition, as a result of bacteria e coli 0157. She\u2019d been transferred to Bristol Children\u2019s Hospital from the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro, where she had spent several days. Parents Rachel and Luke Bradford brought Coco to hospital on July 24, 2017, as their daughter had been vomiting, had diarrhoea and had spotted blood in her stool. They were sent home from the emergency department after being told she likely had Gastroenteritis but Coco\u2019s condition did not improve, so they returned her to hospital less than a day later. An inquest into Coco\u2019s death heard that doctors felt her condition was not serious, despite the family pleading for more to be done. Coco\u2019s condition continued to worsen as she remained at Royal Cornwall Hospital for three days. She was moved to Bristol Children's Hospital on July 28, but sadly died a few days later. And her heartbroken mum Rachel told the coroner staff then 'unforgivably' tried to cover up their own failings by blaming her daughter's autism and claimed she was being difficult to treat. The inquest heard that there were several missed opportunities by doctors and consultants to catch Coco\u2019s condition sooner. Coupled with delays to her being given fluids, antibiotics and a delay in the transfer to Bristol, doctors failed to check her blood pressure and nurses were too slow to send off stool samples for examination. Rachel, who told the hearing that she'd fought for four years to expose the truth and failings around her daughter's death, said earlier in the inquest that her daughter had been labelled \"uncooperative\" by hospital staff and that this was a reason care was insufficient. Fighting back tears, she said they discovered medical staff had \"multiple opportunities to change the course of Coco's treatment that could have saved her life.\" This was from the first trip to the emergency department right up until her transfer to ITU. She added: \"None were acted upon. We do not accept human error should be a factor. \"This was failing of the most basic level of care. \"There were notes blaming Coco for being uncooperative. She was in a terrible amount of pain and dying in front of their eyes.\" Despite the \"basic failings\", senior coroner Andrew Cox said Coco was a \"hostage to fortune\". He ruled that there was no medical negligence in Coco's care and no causal link between her death and the failings of Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust. However, he said sweeping changes had been made at the Royal Cornwall Hospital since Coco's death, such as double the number of paediatric consultants and a change to the team who organise transfers between hospitals. There is also now a \"more structured and robust\" handover for paediatric patients, more paediatric nurses and \"simulation\" exercises for both medical staff. The Senior Coroner ruled that the trust had 28 days to show evidence of new guidance to doctors in similar cases. \"I want to make sure lip service isn't just paid to this,\" he said. Mr Cox said the medical director of Royal Cornwall Hospital Dr Allister Grant had \"accepted that there had been some turmoil in the department following these events.\" He added: \"That had now settled and he was satisfied the paediatric department was suitably represented at care group level and provided a safe service. \"He said that Coco's death had been a catalyst for improvements. He said the team had made great strides in improving the service.\" After the inquest Dr Grant said the trust \"entirely\" accepts the conclusion. He added: \"We profoundly regret the failings in the care Coco received. \"While the coroner has concluded, based on the expert evidence, that different treatment would not have avoided Coco's tragic death, this does not take away from the fact that we let Coco and her family down. \"This is a matter of deep sorrow to those who cared for Coco, as was acknowledged during the inquest. \"We also regret Coco's family has been caused additional distress by the belief that Coco's poorly condition was explained by sepsis, as opposed to an overwhelming inflammatory condition called HUS (Haemolytic uraemic syndrome). \"We note the coroner has concluded on the evidence presented during the inquest that Coco did in fact not have sepsis. \"The quality and safety of the care received by each and every patient is our highest priority. \"Following an independent investigation into her death a detailed action plan has been fully implemented and we will now ensure we review the coroner's conclusions with great care to identify any further learning that can improve the provision of care to children, including those with learning difficulties.\" Get email updates with the day's biggest stories ",

      "Matthew Langley was so malnourished his bones were visible through his skin after being left locked up and neglected by Craig and Lorna Hewitt for seven months. The shocking conditions an autistic man who was found 'close to death' after being held captive by his mum and stepdad have been revealed as the couple face jail. Matthew Langley was so malnourished his bones were visible through his skin after being left locked up and neglected by Craig and Lorna Hewitt for seven months. The pair were last week found guilty of false imprisonment after Sheffield Crown Court heard 22-year-old Matthew was found weighing just 6st (38kg)in a faeces and vomit-strewn bedroom. South Yorkshire Police have now released a grim photograph showing piles of rubbish and soiled items. It lays bare the shocking squalor that Matthew had been held in by the Hewitts, who kept the door locked. The court heard police found faeces and vomit over the floor and bedding along with buzzing flies, a bad smell and a key on the outside of the door. The National Autistic Society said the scene was \"deeply disturbing\". Matthew, who also had learning difficulties, suffered from irritable bowel syndrome, double incontinence and arthritis, the court heard. Jurors heard Matthew was found by paramedics seriously underweight, dehydrated and 'with his life hanging in the balance' on June 2, 2020. Nicholas Campbell QC, prosecuting, told the trial the ambulance service was called to the home in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, in the early hours of June 2, 2020. Matthew was rushed to a hospital intensive care unit in a \"pitiable state\" with abrasions indicating he had been moving around on all fours, the prosecutor told the court. He had suffered damage to a kidney with high sodium levels relating to severe dehydration, it was heard. Mr Campbell added: \"His sodium levels were dangerously high. They measured 180. They were so high they could shut down his brain and kill him. Anything above 145, there is a real chance of death. \"The Home Office pathologist examined the injuries and said the abrasions and bruises were consistent in his view with Matthew having been crawling on all fours over objects in his path.\" Mr Campbell said Matthew made a good physical recovery thanks to the hard work of medical professionals and when he was discharged from hospital he weighed 55kg. Craig Hewitt told police his wife Lorna had found Matthew upstairs lying on the floor and he claimed Matthew had been fed and that he ate in his room, the court heard. He also claimed there had been locks on the internal doors because their home used to be a student accommodation. Mr Hewitt stated to police that his stepson Matthew had only been locked in at night because he would go downstairs and set off security alarms. Lorna Hewitt chose to give no comment answers to all questions asked by the police, the court heard. The Hewitts, of Sheffield, South Yorks, were also found guilty of causing or allowing a vulnerable adult to suffer serious physical harm. The couple are due to be sentenced on Friday, February 18.

      "Violent Daniel Boulton is on trial accused of murdering former girlfriend Bethany Vincent and her nine-year-old autistic son, Darren Henson, before leading Lincolnshire Police on a 24-hour manhunt A violent ex-partner brutally stabbed a mum and her young autistic son to death before leading police on a 24-hour manhunt, a court has heard. Daniel Boulton is alleged to have knifed his former girlfriend Bethany Vincent and her nine-year-old son Darren Henson, also known as DJ, \"numerous times\" while the subject of a restraining order on May 31 last year. Boulton developed a \"hatred\" for Darren before the killings, Lincoln Crown Court was told. A nine-month-old child was seen crawling around the house when emergency services arrived at the property in High Holme Road in Louth, Lincolnshire, the court heard, with the defendant later leaving a note saying: \"I, Daniel Boulton, take full responsibility for 182.\" The relationship between Boulton and Ms Vincent had \"deteriorated\" by the end of March 2019 and he was eventually ordered not to contact his ex-partner, jurors were told. Boulton led Lincolnshire Police on a manhunt until the following day, when he allegedly stabbed an off-duty police officer in the leg in the Hubbards Hills area of Louth before being arrested on a nearby farm. Prosecutors said there was \"no dispute\" Boulton stabbed both victims, with him denying the alleged offences because his ability to exercise self-control had been \"impaired\". Opening the case against Boulton on Thursday, prosecutor Katherine Goddard QC said: \"At around 8pm on the evening of May 31 last year, a young woman and her nine-year-old son were brutally stabbed to death in their own home in Louth. \"There is no dispute that the person who stabbed both victims was this defendant, Daniel Boulton. \"Mr Boulton's case will be that, although he physically carried out the stabbings of the two victims, he was, at the time, suffering from a recognised mental condition which substantially impaired his ability to form a rational judgement and exercise self-control.\" Addressing the history between Boulton and Ms Vincent, Ms Goddard said: \"The relationship between Bethany and the defendant began in about March 2019 and, like most relationships, at the start everything was good. Everybody appeared happy. \"But, by the end of that year, it had deteriorated and was marked by, the prosecution say, increasing violence from Mr Boulton towards Bethany and, later, towards her parents. \"Bethany made a complaint to the police about Mr Boulton and the violence and behaviour towards her, and Mr Boulton was made the subject of a restraining order precluding him from contacting her. \"A further restraining order was made after yet another incident in February 2021 but, despite both those orders, Mr Boulton continued to contact Bethany - by telephone, by text message, by social media messages, and by unannounced and uninvited visits to her home. \"None of that contact was sought by Bethany and, in fact, only a few days after her and DJ were stabbed to death, they were due to move to a new house - to an address unknown to Mr Boulton.\" Ms Goddard continued: \"Social services became involved with Bethany and her family after her first complaint to the police of domestic violence in November 2020.\" Their concerns related only to the risk Mr Boulton presented to the family. \"He had, by then, expressed a hatred of DJ, a nine-year-old boy... who had been diagnosed with autism.\" \"He was seen running from an alleyway leading to the back of number 182. \"He seemed flushed, agitated, and called out to the witnesses to call an ambulance as someone had been stabbed inside. \"He then casually walked away, not waiting for the emergency services to arrive.\" Explaining what emergency services saw when they entered the house, Ms Goddard said: \"In the downstairs front room, they found Bethany lying on her side, half curled into a ball, clearly already dead. \"Upstairs, they found DJ, lying on his side alongside his bed, also clearly dead. \"Both appeared to have been stabbed numerous times and, in addition to obvious stab wounds, they had marks consistent with blunt force trauma - being hit by something.\" Ms Goddard said a nine-month-old child had also been found at the property, \"untouched and unharmed but clearly distressed and crawling through the house.\" After allegedly making his escape, Boulton was said to have broken into a bungalow. The following day he ran into a police officer who he allegedly stabbed in the leg after a short confrontation. He tried to flee but police \"flooded\" the area after the stabbed cop called them in. Boulton, of Alexandra Road, Skegness, denies murdering Ms Vincent and her son, assault with intent to resist arrest, and burglary. The trial continues.

Opening the case against Boulton on Thursday, prosecutor Katherine Goddard QC said: \"At around 8pm on the evening of May 31 last year, a young woman and her nine-year-old son were brutally stabbed to death in their own home in Louth. \"There is no dispute that the person who stabbed both victims was this defendant, Daniel Boulton. \"Mr Boulton's case will be that, although he physically carried out the stabbings of the two victims, he was, at the time, suffering from a recognised mental condition which substantially impaired his ability to form a rational judgement and exercise self-control.\" Addressing the history between Boulton and Ms Vincent, Ms Goddard said: \"The relationship between Bethany and the defendant began in about March 2019 and, like most relationships, at the start everything was good. Everybody appeared happy. \"But, by the end of that year, it had deteriorated and was marked by, the prosecution say, increasing violence from Mr Boulton towards Bethany and, later, towards her parents. \"Bethany made a complaint to the police about Mr Boulton and the violence and behaviour towards her, and Mr Boulton was made the subject of a restraining order precluding him from contacting her. \"A further restraining order was made after yet another incident in February 2021 but, despite both those orders, Mr Boulton continued to contact Bethany - by telephone, by text message, by social media messages, and by unannounced and uninvited visits to her home. \"None of that contact was sought by Bethany and, in fact, only a few days after her and DJ were stabbed to death, they were due to move to a new house - to an address unknown to Mr Boulton.\" Ms Goddard continued: \"Social services became involved with Bethany and her family after her first complaint to the police of domestic violence in November 2020.\" Their concerns related only to the risk Mr Boulton presented to the family. \"He had, by then, expressed a hatred of DJ, a nine-year-old boy... who had been diagnosed with autism.\" \"He was seen running from an alleyway leading to the back of number 182. \"He seemed flushed, agitated, and called out to the witnesses to call an ambulance as someone had been stabbed inside. \"He then casually walked away, not waiting for the emergency services to arrive.\" Explaining what emergency services saw when they entered the house, Ms Goddard said: \"In the downstairs front room, they found Bethany lying on her side, half curled into a ball, clearly already dead. \"Upstairs, they found DJ, lying on his side alongside his bed, also clearly dead. \"Both appeared to have been stabbed numerous times and, in addition to obvious stab wounds, they had marks consistent with blunt force trauma - being hit by something.\" Ms Goddard said a nine-month-old child had also been found at the property, \"untouched and unharmed but clearly distressed and crawling through the house.\" After allegedly making his escape, Boulton was said to have broken into a bungalow. The following day he ran into a police officer who he allegedly stabbed in the leg after a short confrontation. He tried to flee but police \"flooded\" the area after the stabbed cop called them in. Boulton, of Alexandra Road, Skegness, denies murdering Ms Vincent and her son, assault with intent to resist arrest, and burglary. The trial continues.

      "Nicola Cassidy is launching a legal battle in a desperate bid to free her son from his \"life in a box\" where she says his care is \"worse than being in prison\", his meals are pushed through a hatch and he is constantly watched via CCTV A young man with autism has been locked up in an old file room with his meals pushed through a hatch for more than four years according to his desperate mum. Patient A, 24, lives at private psychiatric facility, Cheadle Royal Hospital in Greater Manchester, which is part of the Priory group. His mother, Nicola Cassidy, 49, says his movements inside the \"tiny\" room, are constantly tracked by CCTV, he has no physical contact with anybody and his meals are slid through a gap in the bottom of a wooden hatch. Patient A, who also has a learning disability and Tourette's syndrome, has been detained under the Mental Health Act since September 2017 in what his mum claims is an old file room at the back of the hospital. Now Nicola from Liverpool is preparing to launch a legal battle to have him released from his \"life in a box\" adding that \"people wouldn't treat an animal\" like they do her son and his care is \"worse than being in prison\". She said: \"We fully appreciate that my son has complex needs but he's being treated terribly. \"He's locked away from the world and has no physical contact with anyone. For his meals to be pushed through a tiny gap in the bottom of the hatch is awful. \"People wouldn't treat an animal that way and I feel that his care is worse than being in prison. \"He has challenges but is a loving and caring person who needs stimulation and support. \"He is getting nothing at present. I can't even hold his hand or hug him because of the conditions he's kept in.\" The desperate mum is taking her case to the Court of Protection in the hopes a judge will review her son's sectioning under the Mental Health Act - and with the help of Liverpool's Clinical Commissioning Group and Council get him back into a home in the community. Currently, Patient A has a bedroom, a bathroom and a small lounge area, plus a \"snug\" or sensory room, where he often sleeps, under the eye of a CCTV camera at Cheadle Royal Hospital.

The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at 12noon and every evening. Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here. Nicola says he is looked after by staff at a ratio of five to one and when his room needs cleaning he is shut in a separate area, such as an area of garden, closed off by high metal fencing. She believes with the right support her son will flourish and be able to spend more time with his family. She said: \"Every time I see him it breaks my heart. He has no quality of life, he just exists. \"I've been told by some of those involved in my son's care that things aren't working and Patient A could, with the right support, be cared for in the community. \"It's difficult not to think that the longer he's left, the worse his condition will become, until the point where he's unable to be released. \"This isn't about money. He has five carers assigned to him all the time. \"That level of staffing is costly and is probably a waste of money given that he has no contact with anyone. \"We keep asking for more to be done to support my son but nothing seems to happen. We've been left with no choice other than to take this action. \"All I want is what any mum would want and that is the best for their son so he can try and make the most of his life.\" Nicola says her son had a typical childhood up until around the age of 12. He was diagnosed as autistic aged seven, then later with Tourette's and a learning disability. It was around the age of 14 that his family started to struggle with managing the changes in his mental state and Patient A hit crisis point. He left his family home to go into residential care aged 14 in 2012 and was moved from placement to placement. He was admitted to Mersey Lodge ward in Cheadle Royal Hospital on September 5, 2017, where he has stayed ever since. Kirsty Stuart, an expert public law and human rights lawyer at Irwin Mitchell representing Patient A and Nicola, said: \"This is yet another case where the loved ones of people with autism and/or a learning disability are detained in units which were not designed to care for people such as Patient A. \"The first-hand account we've heard from Nicola about what's happening to her son is probably the worst I've heard. \"Understandably Patient A's family are deeply concerned. We're now investigating these concerns and how the legal process can help the family. \"We call on The Priory, the CCG and local authority to work with ourselves and Patient A's family to reach an agreement over his care, which the family believe should be in the community as this would give him the best quality of life.\" A total of 2,040 people with learning disabilities and/or autism were in the hospitals at the end of August 2021, according to NHS Digital figures. Of those, 1,145 - 56 percent - had been in hospital for a total of more than two years. The average cost to the taxpayer of keeping a person detained in hospital is thought to be \u00a33,563 per week or \u00a3185,276 per year. But the Priory Group, which runs the private psychiatric hospital, has denied Nicola's claims that food is slid under the hatch to her son. The group claim the facility is purpose-built and while it does have a serving hatch in the door, they say it is a \"large square space where items of various sizes can be passed though including his food on a tray\". A spokesman for the group also said the accommodation was \"fully renovated to provide the care package that has been commissioned by the Clinical Commissioning Group\". The group added the family provided input at the time on the design and were supportive of the accommodation being provided.

      "Nicola Cassidy is launching a legal battle in a desperate bid to free her son from his \"life in a box\" where she says his care is \"worse than being in prison\", his meals are pushed through a hatch and he is constantly watched via CCTV A young man with autism has been locked up in an old file room with his meals pushed through a hatch for more than four years according to his desperate mum. Patient A, 24, lives at private psychiatric facility, Cheadle Royal Hospital in Greater Manchester, which is part of the Priory group. His mother, Nicola Cassidy, 49, says his movements inside the \"tiny\" room, are constantly tracked by CCTV, he has no physical contact with anybody and his meals are slid through a gap in the bottom of a wooden hatch. Patient A, who also has a learning disability and Tourette's syndrome, has been detained under the Mental Health Act since September 2017 in what his mum claims is an old file room at the back of the hospital. Now Nicola from Liverpool is preparing to launch a legal battle to have him released from his \"life in a box\" adding that \"people wouldn't treat an animal\" like they do her son and his care is \"worse than being in prison\". She said: \"We fully appreciate that my son has complex needs but he's being treated terribly. \"He's locked away from the world and has no physical contact with anyone. For his meals to be pushed through a tiny gap in the bottom of the hatch is awful. \"People wouldn't treat an animal that way and I feel that his care is worse than being in prison. \"He has challenges but is a loving and caring person who needs stimulation and support. \"He is getting nothing at present. I can't even hold his hand or hug him because of the conditions he's kept in.\" The desperate mum is taking her case to the Court of Protection in the hopes a judge will review her son's sectioning under the Mental Health Act - and with the help of Liverpool's Clinical Commissioning Group and Council get him back into a home in the community. Currently, Patient A has a bedroom, a bathroom and a small lounge area, plus a \"snug\" or sensory room, where he often sleeps, under the eye of a CCTV camera at Cheadle Royal Hospital.

Nicola says he is looked after by staff at a ratio of five to one and when his room needs cleaning he is shut in a separate area, such as an area of garden, closed off by high metal fencing. She believes with the right support her son will flourish and be able to spend more time with his family. She said: \"Every time I see him it breaks my heart. He has no quality of life, he just exists. \"I've been told by some of those involved in my son's care that things aren't working and Patient A could, with the right support, be cared for in the community. \"It's difficult not to think that the longer he's left, the worse his condition will become, until the point where he's unable to be released. \"This isn't about money. He has five carers assigned to him all the time. \"That level of staffing is costly and is probably a waste of money given that he has no contact with anyone. \"We keep asking for more to be done to support my son but nothing seems to happen. We've been left with no choice other than to take this action. \"All I want is what any mum would want and that is the best for their son so he can try and make the most of his life.\" Nicola says her son had a typical childhood up until around the age of 12. He was diagnosed as autistic aged seven, then later with Tourette's and a learning disability. It was around the age of 14 that his family started to struggle with managing the changes in his mental state and Patient A hit crisis point. He left his family home to go into residential care aged 14 in 2012 and was moved from placement to placement. He was admitted to Mersey Lodge ward in Cheadle Royal Hospital on September 5, 2017, where he has stayed ever since. Kirsty Stuart, an expert public law and human rights lawyer at Irwin Mitchell representing Patient A and Nicola, said: \"This is yet another case where the loved ones of people with autism and/or a learning disability are detained in units which were not designed to care for people such as Patient A. \"The first-hand account we've heard from Nicola about what's happening to her son is probably the worst I've heard. \"Understandably Patient A's family are deeply concerned. We're now investigating these concerns and how the legal process can help the family. \"We call on The Priory, the CCG and local authority to work with ourselves and Patient A's family to reach an agreement over his care, which the family believe should be in the community as this would give him the best quality of life.\" A total of 2,040 people with learning disabilities and/or autism were in the hospitals at the end of August 2021, according to NHS Digital figures. Of those, 1,145 - 56 percent - had been in hospital for a total of more than two years. The average cost to the taxpayer of keeping a person detained in hospital is thought to be \u00a33,563 per week or \u00a3185,276 per year. But the Priory Group, which runs the private psychiatric hospital, has denied Nicola's claims that food is slid under the hatch to her son. The group claim the facility is purpose-built and while it does have a serving hatch in the door, they say it is a \"large square space where items of various sizes can be passed though including his food on a tray\". A spokesman for the group also said the accommodation was \"fully renovated to provide the care package that has been commissioned by the Clinical Commissioning Group\". The group added the family provided input at the time on the design and were supportive of the accommodation being provided. A Priory spokesman said: \"The welfare of the people we look after is our number one priority. \"We are fully committed to the Transforming Care agenda and to ensuring well-planned transfers to the most appropriate community settings whenever they become available. \"Our Adult Care division has successfully provided at least 39 such placements, with positive outcomes for the individuals involved. \"Unfortunately, however, some individuals with highly complex behaviours, and detained under the Mental Health Act, can be difficult to place despite all parties working very hard together over a long period of time to find the right setting. \"At all times we work closely with families, commissioners, and NHSE to ensure patients are receiving the safest, most appropriate care in our facilities. \"That care is delivered and kept under regular review by a multi-disciplinary team of experts, including a consultant psychiatrist and an NHS autism specialist, and independently reviewed by commissioners. \"Staff provide round-the-clock support at Mersey Lodge and all interventions are carefully and continually reviewed, monitored and assessed to ensure they are in the best interests of patients, with the aim of achieving the least restrictive setting possible. \"Medication is always prescribed by a consultant psychiatrist, and where patients are detained under the MHA, agreed by a second, independent doctor from the CQC.

      "Gina Fitzgerald died from issues with her heart, but the circumstances she was found in at her home in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, have left her heartbroken family traumatised A seven-year-old boy with autism awoke to find his beloved grandma dead after the pair huddled together for warmth in their freezing cold home. Gina Fitzgerald's death was caused by heart problems and the cold conditions were not a factor in her passing. But the circumstances she was found in have traumatised her grieving family, Coventry Live reports. The boy, who turns eight this week, found his nan had passed away after waking up next to her at their home in Camp HIll, Nuneaton, Warwickshire, last week. The night before Gina had huddled close to her grandson to keep away the cold after being left without suitable heating at their house. Gina's family say they had been left without a working boiler for months. But Bromford Housing claims temporary heating had been provided while they were trying to arrange a fix for the broken boiler. Speaking to Coventry Live, a family friend said all they received were three small heaters which the Fitzgeralds said they could not afford to run all night. They also feared for their safety if the electrical devices were left on from bedtime until the morning. The friend, who didn't want to be named, told CoventryLive that while the cold conditions did not contribute to the death of the much-loved community member, who died from a heart condition, they said the situation they have been forced to live in has added to the family's trauma, especially that of the boy. In fact, the heartache has been made worse for the little boy, who has autism, turned eight this week - without his beloved grandma being there. \"Whilst there is no evidence to prove the cold is the reason for sad passing it clearly would not have helped her when she was suffering with a heart condition,\" the family friend said. \"On the morning of December 2, her grandson woke next to her, and was unable to wake her.\" Having autism, this must have been the most traumatic experience. \"When friends came in to help the family during the shock we were told the house was freezing we were shivering. Gina was found wrapped in blankets just trying to keep warm, when the ambulance crew arrived they tried to revive her but she had gone. \"The family are left in utter grief and dismay, Gina was the main support for this vulnerable family.\" Friends and the Camp Hill community have rallied around the family at their time of huge loss and have launched a fund-raising appeal in her name. Camp Hill-based charity, The Guardians Grow Charity, are spearheading the funeral and send off they say she deserves. Money raised will also be donated to the family, who the charity says will struggle without their matriarch. So far, the fund has raised just over \u00a3500 in a matter of days, but they hope to double it to help the family as much as they can. Bromford has said that the family reported issues with the boiler last month and they had planned to carry out the works last week. A spokesperson offered their condolences to the family, and said they will work with them to fix the heating, having provided temporary heating in the meantime. In a statement, Natalie Robertson, Bromford\u2019s associate director of localities, said: \u201cWe were deeply saddened to hear of Mrs Fitzgerald\u2019s death and have offered her family our condolences at this difficult time. \"We carried out our annual safety inspection of the heating and hot water system at Mrs Fitzgerald\u2019s property in June and found it to be in good working order. \"Mrs Fitzgerald contacted us in mid-November about a fault to her emersion heater affecting her heating and hot water, and we attended two days later to investigate and ordered the parts needed to complete the repair. \"We had scheduled for the repairs to be completed in early December and are now liaising with the family to rearrange this and have provided temporary heating in the meantime.\" The 'Help give Gina a respectful funeral' page is running on GoFundMe.

      "Rho Miller says that her assistance dog Lyra has transformed her life after the Labrador helped her to become more independent \u201cI\u2019m grateful for her beyond words, and that I love her with all my heart.\u201d Rho Miller says that's what she'd tell her beloved dog Lyra if she could explain how much the Labrador means to her. Lyra is an assistance dog for Rho, from Cornwall, and has been an invaluable addition to the 20-year-old\u2019s life by helping her with everyday tasks she used to \u201cstruggle immensely\u201d with. \u201cI already tell her every day how much I love her, and I wish she could truly understand what that means,\u201d Rho says. \u201cHow much she has changed my life for the better.\u201d Rho was diagnosed as autistic back in 2019. \u201cI always suspected that something was different, even when I was younger,\u201d she says. \u201cI always struggled at school, especially with bullying. I often used to pretend I was sick so I wouldn\u2019t have to go to school, in fear of what might happen that day.\u201d Rho says that even as an adult, she was \u201cterrified\u201d of going places on her own because of the panic and sensory overload that would come with visiting busy places such as supermarkets and shops. But since getting assistance dog Lyra, Rho\u2019s life has been transformed. Rho has trained the gorgeous Labrador to help her with daily tasks, and having Lyra by her side has allowed her to do things that would have previously been unthinkable. \u201cLyra has improved my well-being more than I could ever expect,\u201d Rho says. \u201cBecause of her I am so much more independent, I have more confidence in myself along with a higher self-esteem, and I enjoy my life way more than I did before. \u201cShe is my little companion and best friend - I often say she is my partner in crime!\u201d Lyra helps Rho with chores around the house, from assisting with laundry to keeping her owner company while she\u2019s brushing her teeth or showering. \u201cThis distracts me from my anxiety, stops me from getting stressed about the task that I\u2019m trying to do, and reminds me that I\u2019m not alone,\u201d Rho says. The Labrador can also do deep pressure therapy, which means putting her weight on Rho\u2019s legs to keep her calm - this allows her owner to recover from sensory overload much more quickly. \u201c Without this, I would be frozen in place in a shutdown state for a long time, and I would be exhausted from this episode so much that I would not be able to do anything for the rest of the day,\u201d Rho explains. When the pair go out, Lyra can guide Rho safely around their environment by following directions, helping to find places such as a checkout or exit. \u201cWithout Lyra guiding me, I would end up very lost,\u201d says Rho. \u201cNow I thoroughly enjoy going out, because Lyra keeps me safe and grounded.\u201d Although Lyra is \u201cincredibly focused and dedicated\u201d in her assistance dog role, when she\u2019s off-duty the pup\u2019s \u201cbig personality\u201d is always making Rho laugh. \u201cAs soon as you take her working harness off, and say the magic words \u2018all done working\u2019, she switches into the most energetic, playful, and humorous dog, and will run around the house grabbing her toys and showing them to you proudly.\u201d Rho shares her daily adventures with Lyra on her Instagram page @lifewithlyralab , and hopes that their heart-warming story will show others just how important assistance dogs can be in helping disabled people. \u201cSociety teaches us that we are not enough; that we should stay at home, and that we need to act more \u2018normal\u2019 and \u2018get over ourselves\u2019 if we want to succeed in life,\u201d Rho says. \u201cBut by having an assistance dog, we can achieve so much more than society gives us credit for, while still being ourselves.\u201d Calling all dog lovers!

      "The tearful boy said he was frightened he might hurt himself or others around him and asked for help as his mum tried to comfort and reassure him A brave family has shared a harrowing video of their 10-year-old boy in torment in an attempt to find him the mental health support he desperately needs. The youngster, referred to as James to protect his identity, tearfully pleaded for help to stop him from hurting himself or others in a heartbreaking video filmed by his mum Michelle. James' family, of Staffordshire, said his mental health has been in decline since the death of a relative six years ago and he has now started to have dreams in which he hurts people. His devastated mum and aunt said he regularly talks about stabbing himself or jumping off a bridge but that he has never been seen in person or offered medication by Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS). Instead, they are forced to rely on monthly Zoom meetings which they said have not restarted since their appointment was cancelled in November due to staff illness, reports Stoke on Trent Live. Michelle, 44, told how she put her son's bed in her room and wakes up \"every time he rolls over\" in case he tries to go downstairs in the night and hurt himself. \"I'm really frightened that I won't have my little boy for much longer and that one day he will kill himself,\" she said. \"He keeps saying he is worthless and just causes problems for the family. He says he wants brain surgery so he can have part of his brain removed and forget. \"He doesn't feel like he can ever recover from this. He has lost hope and doesn't want to be here anymore. He's only 10. He shouldn't be having these thoughts.\" When the family called the All-Age Access Team in desperation, they said they were told to \"keep an eye on him\" or take him to A&E. They have even tried contacting their local council's social workers and safeguarding team for help. But Michelle said it feels like they are in a vicious circle where they keep getting sent back to CAMHS, run by North Staffordshire Combined Healthcare NHS Trust. She added: \"I tell him he's my baby and so special to me, and that he is worthy to be here, because he is.\" \"He is a lovely boy and so affectionate. I feel so sick and useless because he is pleading for help and I can't get him the help he's begging for. James is currently waiting for an autism assessment through Caudwell Children and is only able to attend his mainstream school in the mornings due to his mental health. He was initially offered bereavement support following the death of his grandmother but the sessions did not take place when the then four-year-old told counsellors he did not want to participate. He also received 12 counselling sessions through his school but his family said they were told he needed more support than the charity were equipped to provide. It was at this point when they did a self-referral to CAMHS and began meeting regularly with school staff to help his teachers \"cope with him\". They told how James can be disruptive in class by shouting out, climbing out of his chair and throwing things across the room. He also exhibits tics such as rolling his head and shoulders, repetitive coughing, clearing his throat and excessive blinking and tends to walk on his tiptoes. The little boy also talks obsessively about death and describes gruesome scenes in detail. Aunt Amy, 47, said: \"He loves destruction and disasters. He will talk about people falling out of planes, hitting the concrete and then getting run over by cars. \"He struggles with empathy and it doesn't bother him if people get upset by hearing it - he just carries on. \"We don't know where it has come from because he has never watched that kind of thing on television.\" James' mental health deteriorated further during Covid lockdowns and homeschooling left him inconsolable. Michelle said she has tried every parenting course she can find in an attempt to help her son who is academically bright but struggles socially. James, whose older sister has autism, was assessed for the disorder and ADHD by CAMHS four years ago but the family were told he did not meet the criteria and he was discharged. Since this summer, they have been having monthly Zoom meetings with CAMHS but feel their pleas for more urgent support are being ignored. Amy said: \"I just hope that by raising awareness we can help him in some way, which is why we filmed the video. \"We want to do everything possible to safeguard him and make sure his end goal doesn't happen.\" North Staffordshire Combined Healthcare NHS Trust said they were unable to comment on individual cases.

James, whose older sister has autism, was assessed for the disorder and ADHD by CAMHS four years ago but the family were told he did not meet the criteria and he was discharged. Since this summer, they have been having monthly Zoom meetings with CAMHS but feel their pleas for more urgent support are being ignored. Amy said: \"I just hope that by raising awareness we can help him in some way, which is why we filmed the video. \"We want to do everything possible to safeguard him and make sure his end goal doesn't happen.\" North Staffordshire Combined Healthcare NHS Trust said they were unable to comment on individual cases.

      "Tamekia Thompson, 37, says she is desperate to move from her south London home, as her landlord claims he served her with an eviction notice for failing to pay rent for about seven months A single mum who claims to be living in a rodent-infested house says she lives in fear of her four-year-old autistic son eating mouse poo. Tamekia Thompson, 37, says she is desperate to move from her south London home. The mum-of-two claims rodents eat her food, and the floors and cupboards are strewn with thousands of droppings. Tamekia, a private tenant who moved into the property in 2016 with her two young children, said the house became infested with mice two years ago, MyLondon reports. She said her seven-year-old daughter is incredibly stressed and she is terrified her four-year-old autistic son who \"will eat anything\" will ingest the droppings and get sick. Tamekia's landlord claims he has put in measures to address the infestation. Christian Mantey told MyLondon he has a contract with a pest control company, who have laid traps in the house and have agreed to visit every two weeks to dispose of dead mice and fill in holes. He added that the process is taking longer than usual because pest control cannot put poison down over safety concerns with Tamekia's son. He also explained that \"the tenant is aware of this\". Mr Mantey said he has now issued a Section 8 eviction notice to Tamekia, who has not paid her rent for around seven months. He said: \"I've given [Tamekia] her Section 8 notice telling her to leave because she's in arrears of \u00a33,600. \"In terms of the rodent issue in the house, there's been pest control that has come to the property, I think about a month ago while she was there. \"They set up all the traps and all the other equipment they needed in front of her. \"She said they can't put certain traps around because of the kids, so they adjusted the traps according to how she wanted it. \"They come every two weeks, I've got a contract with them that they will come every two or three weeks to pick up the dead mice or whatever they find, and to fill up the holes.\" He added: \"I'm doing what I've got to do, the pest control is doing what they've got to do, you can't eradicate these things straight away.\" Tamekia claims she is withholding the rent due to problems with the house, including the rodent infestation. She said that she left her job in August to care for her son full time and is now dependent on Universal Credit from Croydon Council to pay her rent, which she says she hasn't paid due to the mouse infestation. Tamekia says she was told by a pest control worker that, because of the severity of the infection, it would be tricky to get rid of them. Tamekia also said the house also has severe issues with damp on one of the walls. However, Mr Mantey claims Tamekia has never told him that her failure to pay rent is due to her problems with the house, or the mouse infestation. Mr Mantey also claims he has had someone fix the damp in the house two years ago and Tamekia didn't complain again until two weeks ago. He said he has recently been contacted by Croydon Council about the house, who he said have given him 60 days to get 'specific' jobs done in the house, including fixing the damp and repairing the windows. He said: \"There are people coming to do the whole property. I'm sorting it.\" Speaking about the mouse infestation, he added: \"Getting rid of any infestation takes whatever it's going to take.\" Tamekia, who is currently on a housing waiting list with Croydon Council, moved into the house to support her sister, who had access to the property under the Shared Lives scheme through the council. The former care worker said: \"My kids are scared, screaming, crying, they don't want to sleep in the room. \"My daughter said to me 'mummy I'm stressed'... and it really broke my heart. I can tell she's frustrated.\" She said: \"[My son] will eat anything, you have to be watching him.\" Tamekia said her family gets sick a lot: \"My kids they are vomiting and stuff like that... every minute we are catching colds... it's just hard work for me to be cleaning [mouse] poo every day...\" The council confirmed Tamekia is on a housing waiting list but have advised her to seek alternative accommodation due to a housing shortage. Steve Reed, MP for Croydon North, also raised the issue with the council in September, but contacted Tamekia on November 22 to say he was yet to receive a response. A Croydon Council spokesperson told MyLondon that they have advised Tamekia on her current private arrangement with her landlord. They say they have advised her to seek alternative accommodation through the private rented or social housing sector, as there is a housing shortage. A council spokesperson said: \u201cAlthough this is not a council property, we have provided Ms Thompson with advice and support around her housing options in both the private rented sector and social housing. \"We have also been in contact with her landlord about repairs to his property.\u201d Get email updates with the day's biggest stories ",

She asked members of the public to send him a birthday card to make his birthday special. This morning Harry woke up to almost 300 cards from kind strangers across the world wishing him a great birthday, with possibly even more in the post. Mum Hannah is also organising him a bowling birthday party after she was approach by other parents saying their children wanted to celebrate his 11th birthday with him. When asked what he thought of the hundreds of cards and messages that he had received, Harry said: \"It was the best birthday I have ever had.\" Hannah was initially upset by the way he was treated but has since been blown away by the response of complete strangers. She wanted to raise awareness of autism and to give her son something to make his birthday. \"We're not doing it for any kind of pity party, and we don't want people to buy or send expensive things,\" she added. \"It's just a case of making people aware of it and making a little boy's day.\" Harry has been receiving the cards since December 1 when Hannah posted on Instagram with some coming from people as far away as New Zealand.

      "Emma Armstrong's daughter Libby Crossfield will only eat Aldi's Weetabix and its organic Mamia baby food, and either spaghetti bolognese or spaghetti with tomato and mozzarella sauce A mum has been forced to beg with Aldi for help in a desperate battle to get her hands on the only food her autistic daughter will eat. Emma Armstrong's daughter Libby Crossfield will only eat Aldi's own brand of Weetabix and its organic Mamia baby food, and either spaghetti bolognese or spaghetti with tomato and mozzarella sauce, Manchester Evening News reports. Mum-of-three Emma has always kept well stocked up on the products as she knows that Libby, who has profound social and communication difficulties and suffers from sensory issues, will refuse to eat anything else. But with supermarkets struggling with certain supplies, she's down to her last few tubs and only has enough to last until lunchtime on Saturday, which is Libby's fourth birthday. The panicked mother, from Failsworth, Oldham, has been driving around Aldi stores across Greater Manchester to check for stock and leave her number with managers and she's been in touch with the manufacturer to establish when the retailer was due its next delivery. \"It might seem like a small issue to some people but we're just hitting a brick wall,\" she told Manchester Evening News. \"Aldi are not helping at all other than a standard response. I know they have the stock, the manufacturer told me it arrived from France at the weekend. I just need them to get some to me.\" Family and friends have been on the hunt too, including Emma's sister Adele, whose tweet has been shared more than 200 times - with strangers as far as Aberdeen and Northern Ireland checking their own stores for stock. And it's a lot more serious than Libby just not having the food she likes on her birthday. Emma says eating wheat cereal alone will leave the youngster poorly and malnourished and if she has a period without the baby food, she may struggle to reintroduce it to Libby's diet. Emma, who works in a restaurant and also has five-year-old twin boys Frankie and Finley, said: \"She used to eat more of a variety of baby food but this has decreased to these particular foods. \"My concern is that if this food is taken away from her diet for a time I won\u2019t be able to reintroduce it, this will lead to malnutrition and eventually we could end up with tube feeding or peg feeding.\" She added that it's become like a full-time job trying to track down the food and everything else, including trying to sort a specialist school place for Libby has had to be \"put on the back burner.\" An Aldi spokesperson said: \u201cWe are sorry to hear that Emma hasn\u2019t been able to find our Mamia dishes in store. \"We are working hard with our supplier to deliver Libby\u2019s favourite Mamia dishes to her directly in time for her big birthday.\u201d Get our money-saving tips and top offers direct to your inbox with the Mirror Money newsletter ",

      "Worried parents Rachel and husband Luke initially rushed Coco to hospital on 24 July 2017 but were sent home from the emergency department after being told she likely had Gastroenteritis A six-year-old autistic girl who died of sepsis after a 'catalogue' of errors was 'blamed' by medical staff for being uncooperative, an inquest heard. Coco Bradford lost her life after 'several opportunities' were missed by doctors and consultants to save her. This included failing to order basic blood and stool samples or offering her a simple course of intravenous fluids to rehydrate her, Cornwall Live reports. And her heartbroken mum Rachel Bradford told the coroner, staff then 'unforgivably' tried to cover up their own failings by blaming her daughter's autism and claiming she was being difficult to treat. Worried parents Rachel and husband Luke initially rushed Coco to hospital on 24 July 2017 but were sent home from the emergency department after being told she likely had Gastroenteritis. But she continued to pass liquid and bloody stools and could not hold down any fluids so was rushed back in less than a day later. The inquest heard upon admission, doctors still felt her condition was not serious despite the family pleading for more to be done. Her condition continued to deteriorate and she was transferred from the Treliske Royal Cornwall Hospital three days after admission to the Bristol Children's Hospital where she died of multiple organ failure caused by sepsis. Mrs Bradford, of St Ives, told the coroner on Monday she has fought for four years ever since to expose the truth and failings around her daughter's death at Treliske. Fighting back tears, she said they discovered medical staff had \"multiple opportunities to change the course of Coco's treatment that could have saved her life.\" This was from the first trip to the emergency department right up until her transfer to ITU. She added: \"None were acted upon. We do not accept human error should be a factor. This was failing of the most basic level of care. \"Every member of staff denied knowledge of bloody vomit and faeces yet it is in all notes. \"There were notes blaming Coco for being uncooperative. She was in a terrible amount of pain and dying in front of their eyes.\" The pathologist told the coroner Coco died on 31 July 2017 following withdrawal of intensive care and multi organ failure. She suffered Hemolytic uremic syndrome as a result of e coli 157. The inquest heard she had been transferred to Bristol Children's Hospital from Cornwall three days earlier. Rachel said the failures ranged from not ordering blood samples, giving her a pain score of 0, not picking up signs of sepsis and being not given an IV drip to rehydrate. She added: \"We have never been given the full details of the clinical picture and I'd like you to spare a thought how her sister Chelsea is feeling. \"A fellow clinician telling her not to worry and her little sister is fine. All concerns and questions around sepsis and e-coli dismissed - when actually she was dying. \"Had we not persisted and if Chelsea was not a healthcare professional, we would never know the truth of what happened to Coco. We are still waiting for the full truth l but I suspect that may never happen. Rachel added that she found all the failures, delays and lack of treatment \"staggering in this day of modern medicine.\" She said: \"Luke and I became more and more upset and concerned by the air of nonchalance of staff around her condition. It seemed they had no idea what was wrong with her. \"They did not recognise she was close to death. \"We were told she'd be fine and every time we asked we were told a stool sample was not needed or been requested. \"I felt they always thought I was overreacting and worrying for nothing every time we asked questions. \"Blaming Coco and her autism for their own incompetency and failure to treat her is absolutely unforgivable.\" Rachel said she had been told that e-coli 157 - if treated with aggressive fluid rehydration - had a survival rate of 97 per cent with babies and the elderly those who suffer worse. See what\u2019s happening near you by entering your postcode below or visit InYourArea And she told the coroner the effect on her family of their loss had been indescribable. She added: \"To meet Coco was to love her. Her life with ours was getting better and better and she learned to communicate again. \"A week before she fell ill, I posted about how happy she was. She was in such a good place and we finally felt she would have the life she deserved and was going to mainstream school full time. \"If I could have sat in the bed with her and die as well, I would have done. Coco was my absolute world and living without her is almost too much to bear. \"Coco was a strong and healthy six-and-a-half-year-old. The effect on our family has been so deep and so divisive. \"Life will never be the same again. We are forced to live a life we did not want to. We do not deserve. Not only have we lost beautiful Coco without the chance to live her life, we have been fractured to a level you will never understand.\" The Mirror's newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.

She said the family have spent four years battling and being lied to as she tried to get to the truth. \"We have been treated with the upmost contempt,\" she added. \"There have been tears, tears and more tears every single day. We just want the truth. You never know how it feels until it happens to you.\" Dr Saul Diaz Reales was the doctor who initially saw Coco in the emergency department at Treliske and sent her home. He told the coroner he had no evidence her blood pressure was not normal. He added: \"I would have wanted to see a blood sample if that was the case. In the benefit of hindsight it is difficult to have a case where Coco should not have been admitted.

      "Worried parents Rachel and husband Luke initially rushed Coco to hospital on 24 July 2017 but were sent home from the emergency department after being told she likely had Gastroenteritis A six-year-old autistic girl who died of sepsis after a 'catalogue' of errors was 'blamed' by medical staff for being uncooperative, an inquest heard. Coco Bradford lost her life after 'several opportunities' were missed by doctors and consultants to save her. This included failing to order basic blood and stool samples or offering her a simple course of intravenous fluids to rehydrate her, Cornwall Live reports. And her heartbroken mum Rachel Bradford told the coroner, staff then 'unforgivably' tried to cover up their own failings by blaming her daughter's autism and claiming she was being difficult to treat. Worried parents Rachel and husband Luke initially rushed Coco to hospital on 24 July 2017 but were sent home from the emergency department after being told she likely had Gastroenteritis. But she continued to pass liquid and bloody stools and could not hold down any fluids so was rushed back in less than a day later. The inquest heard upon admission, doctors still felt her condition was not serious despite the family pleading for more to be done. Her condition continued to deteriorate and she was transferred from the Treliske Royal Cornwall Hospital three days after admission to the Bristol Children's Hospital where she died of multiple organ failure caused by sepsis. Mrs Bradford, of St Ives, told the coroner on Monday she has fought for four years ever since to expose the truth and failings around her daughter's death at Treliske. Fighting back tears, she said they discovered medical staff had \"multiple opportunities to change the course of Coco's treatment that could have saved her life.\" This was from the first trip to the emergency department right up until her transfer to ITU. She added: \"None were acted upon. We do not accept human error should be a factor. This was failing of the most basic level of care. \"Every member of staff denied knowledge of bloody vomit and faeces yet it is in all notes. \"There were notes blaming Coco for being uncooperative. She was in a terrible amount of pain and dying in front of their eyes.\" The pathologist told the coroner Coco died on 31 July 2017 following withdrawal of intensive care and multi organ failure. She suffered Hemolytic uremic syndrome as a result of e coli 157. The inquest heard she had been transferred to Bristol Children's Hospital from Cornwall three days earlier. Rachel said the failures ranged from not ordering blood samples, giving her a pain score of 0, not picking up signs of sepsis and being not given an IV drip to rehydrate. She added: \"We have never been given the full details of the clinical picture and I'd like you to spare a thought how her sister Chelsea is feeling. \"A fellow clinician telling her not to worry and her little sister is fine. All concerns and questions around sepsis and e-coli dismissed - when actually she was dying. \"Had we not persisted and if Chelsea was not a healthcare professional, we would never know the truth of what happened to Coco. We are still waiting for the full truth l but I suspect that may never happen. Rachel added that she found all the failures, delays and lack of treatment \"staggering in this day of modern medicine.\" She said: \"Luke and I became more and more upset and concerned by the air of nonchalance of staff around her condition. It seemed they had no idea what was wrong with her. \"They did not recognise she was close to death. \"We were told she'd be fine and every time we asked we were told a stool sample was not needed or been requested. \"I felt they always thought I was overreacting and worrying for nothing every time we asked questions. \"Blaming Coco and her autism for their own incompetency and failure to treat her is absolutely unforgivable.\" Rachel said she had been told that e-coli 157 - if treated with aggressive fluid rehydration - had a survival rate of 97 per cent with babies and the elderly those who suffer worse.

She added: \"To meet Coco was to love her. Her life with ours was getting better and better and she learned to communicate again. \"A week before she fell ill, I posted about how happy she was. She was in such a good place and we finally felt she would have the life she deserved and was going to mainstream school full time. \"If I could have sat in the bed with her and die as well, I would have done. Coco was my absolute world and living without her is almost too much to bear. \"Coco was a strong and healthy six-and-a-half-year-old. The effect on our family has been so deep and so divisive. \"Life will never be the same again. We are forced to live a life we did not want to. We do not deserve. Not only have we lost beautiful Coco without the chance to live her life, we have been fractured to a level you will never understand.\" The Mirror's newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.

She said the family have spent four years battling and being lied to as she tried to get to the truth. \"We have been treated with the upmost contempt,\" she added. \"There have been tears, tears and more tears every single day. We just want the truth. You never know how it feels until it happens to you.\" Dr Saul Diaz Reales was the doctor who initially saw Coco in the emergency department at Treliske and sent her home. He told the coroner he had no evidence her blood pressure was not normal. He added: \"I would have wanted to see a blood sample if that was the case. In the benefit of hindsight it is difficult to have a case where Coco should not have been admitted. Looking at the evidence I had at the time I fail to see what I could have done better.\" He added he had 'no evidence' of there being blood in her stools and at the time was \"happy and satisfied\" to send her home.
