It's a continuation of previous messengers of Allah that all carried the same message; 'There is One God, He is Unique, He is Uncreated, We are his Creation and we must worship him alone, and no other deity or creation.' Messengers have appeared from the inception of humankind, Adam being the first and Mohammed being the last. In between, there have been over 100,000 messengers sent to mankind to each specific nation according to Islam.</p></li><li class=\"_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Islam is the only one to claim it's the last message of Allah and it's sent for all of Mankind and Mohammed (peace be upon him) is the last messenger.</p></li><li class=\"_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">The Quran is the only text that can be verified and traced back to the time of its inception (When it was revealed to Mohammed). This point is extremely important, as to base your worldview upon something, you must be sure it's the true authentic message and not corrupted.</p></li><li class=\"_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">The Quran is free from Contradiction and there are claims inside the Quran to prove its validity. The main ones are, 'The promise of Allah to preserve the message until the end of time', 'To not contain any contradictions' (as this would negate it being from an all Knowledgable creator), 'A challenge to create a verse like it'. If any of these are broken, the validity of the Quran will be false.</p></li></ol><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">There are others, but I feel like these are important to point out as generally, people talk of Islam while making basic errors. If there are any misconceptions anyone has, I'd be happy to clear them up. All I ask is that you present it in a respectful way and be sincere in your discourse and conduct.</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  \"  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  \"  >  W  h  y     I  s  l  a  m     i  s     u  n  i  q  u  e     a  m  o  n  g  s  t     a  l  l     o  t  h  e  r     m  a  j  o  r     r  e  l  i  g  i  o  n  s  <  /  h  1  >"},

But most likely space and time don't figure at a fundamental level.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Yet, for some reason, the magnitude and the expansive nature of these frameworks are brought into play to say how insignificant we are to the universe in the bigger scheme of things or derive philosophical conclusions based on an onthology that is misleading</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">In fact, i would argue that the fine tuning of the universe and the fact that we can understand it means that life could play a bigger role than we imagine. And this doesn't come from a religious perspective. There are very strong philosophical and scientific indications that an universe witouth someone to perceive it would  look very different or not exist altogether, as many modern physicists would claim. There sre not cranks or new age hippies we are talking about.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">The problem is these ideas have not reached yet the public consciousness in a big way. Most people still conceptualize the universe as a very big place where we just apoeared randomly on some corner. However, there might be more interdependence than we think between us and 'what is out there' so it is very premature and naive to draw philosophical conclusions based on current undetstanding.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">I guess the bigger picture i'm trying to get across is that science is not a good guide for telling truths about what ultimate reality might be and the role we play in the universe. So many people nowdays think science is or will be able to provide answers to foundational questions humans have been asking since the beginning, thus falling into scientism. But, at the end of the day, we are still stuck with philosophy and religion, all coming down to a jump of faith.</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  \"  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  \"  >  S  c  i  e  n  c  e     c  a  n  '  t     e  v  e  n     t  e  l  l     w  h  a  t     s  p  a  c  e     n  o  r     t  i  m  e     a  r  e     a  n  d     y  e  t     t  h  e  s  e     n  o  t  i  o  n  s     a  r  e     b  r  o  u  g  h  t     t  o     c  l  a  i  m     h  o  w     i  n  s  i  g  n  i  f  i  c  a  n  t     h  u  m  a  n  s     a  r  e  <  /  h  1  >"},

If purgatorial universalism is true, I may have to go to hell for a bit or wait in purgatory for a bit then I'll go to heaven anyway. If annihilationism is true I will maybe suffer for a bit but eventually, be eternally destroyed and cease to exist. All these viewpoints of Hell pale in comparison to eternal conscious torment. ECT means that I would be suffering in a lake of fire under maximum physical and mental agony forever and ever without end due to coming to the incorrect conclusion on the gospel. ECT makes accepting the gospel the most significant act a human being can do without any possible terms of comparison due to the consequences of not doing so. Most importantly if ECT is true every Christian that says ECT is not true will be doing unbelievers a disservice and may be liable to God for not adequately warning us of the severity of the consequences of rejecting Jesus.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Assumption-Hell exists, and it is eternal conscious torment</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">If that assumption is correct, it's good to be saved and to be sure of your salvation. How can Christians be sure of their salvation due to contradictory assertions on salvation? Some say you have to speak in tongues, or you will burn in hell, some say you must live a life of holiness and repentance, and any declaration of faith in Christ, or the gospel is meaningless unless backed up by a holy lifestyle, many say lifestyle doesn't matter all you have to do is accept Jesus.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Someone who is convinced that Jesus is their Lord and Saviour, and the gospel is true and fails to live a holy lifestyle could face ECT for being lukewarm and failing to TRULY accept the gospel through their lifestyle. This shows that incorrect theology even amongst Christians can be the difference between ECT and eternal life.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">That's why I think it's unreasonable to claim that theological differences between hell and salvation are trivial when they could be the difference between ECT and eternal life.</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  \"  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  \"  >  C  h  r  i  s  t  i  a  n     t  h  e  o  l  o  g  i  c  a  l     d  i  f  f  e  r  e  n  c  e  s     o  n     h  e  l  l     a  n  d     s  a  l  v  a  t  i  o  n     a  r  e     N  O  T     t  r  i  v  i  a  l  <  /  h  1  >"},

{"title": "<h1 class=\"_eYtD2XCVieq6emjKBH3m\">The insistence by most Christians that the gospels were authored by eyewitnesses shows they lack faith that the Holy Spirit divinely inspired these texts</h1>", "content": "<div class=\"_3xX726aBn29LDbsDtzr_6E _1Ap4F5maDtT1E1YuCiaO0r D3IL3FD0RFy_mkKLPwL4\" style=\"max-width:800px\" data-click-id=\"text\" data-adclicklocation=\"media\"><div class=\"_292iotee39Lmt0MkQZ2hPV RichTextJSON-root\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">There is no evidence from the NT that the gospels were authored by eyewitnesses: they are undeniably written anonymously and in the third person and contain no accidental or intentional references by the authors to suggest that they were present for the events or dialog related there. Furthermore, the consensus of academic scholars is that the earliest gospel (Mark) was written two generations after Jesus' death, the last (John) written three generations after.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Furthermore, even by tradition, two of the gospels (Mark and Luke) were not authored by eyewitnesses, and \"Luke\" was a merely a companion of Paul, who himself was not an eyewitness. Furthermore, the Gospel of John contains text that suggests the author(s) were not eyewitnesses. Finally, the earliest reliable reference to the gospels we have under the names of the four evangelists comes about a century after the synoptics were written**, suggesting that the \"authors\" were an invention of much later Christians.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">In other words, there are very good reasons to believe not only that the gospel were not authored by eyewitnesses -- let alone the ones whose names they bear in modern Bibles -- but that we literally have no idea who wrote them,  which is the consensus of academic scholars, which means we have no idea if they even got their information from eyewitnesses.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Despite this, most Christians insist that the <em class=\"_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE\">tradition</em> handed down by earlier Christians concerning  who wrote the gospels is unquestionably accurate**. This is what most Christians teach their children, it a common \"fact\" cited in Christian stories and sermons, and Christian apologetics frequently rely heavily on the assumption that the gospels were written by the named eyewitnesses (Matthew &amp; John) or their close companions (Mark &amp; Luke). For instance, see <a href=\"https://navigatingbyfaith.com/2020/11/09/the-case-for-jesus-christ-rests-on-the-evidence-of-eyewitnesses/\" class=\"_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">\"The Case for Jesus Christ Rests on the Evidence of Eyewitnesses\"</a>.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">But it seems extremely odd that Christians feel the need to insist that this is true. After all, the gospels undeniably contain accounts of events and dialog that the named eyewitnesses could not have been (or were very unlikely to be) present to witness. Examples include events related to Jesus' birth and baptism, events related to Jesus' arrest and trial and execution, events on the day of the discovery of the empty tomb.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Many Christians believe that the gospel accounts of these events are completely accurate -- and for large numbers of Christians, that these events even literally happened as described -- despite the lack of eyewitness testimony. Why? Because both Protestant and Catholic Christians generally believe that the NT was \"authored\" by God, who used the Holy Spirit to divinely inspire the authors of the gospels to write only what God wanted written and to write it completely accurately. For instance, here's what the  Catechism of the Catholic church says</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\"><em class=\"_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE\">\" God is the author of Sacred Scripture because he inspired its human authors; he acts in them and by means of them. He thus gives assurance that their writings teach without error his saving truth\"</em></p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">And here's what the <a href=\"https://www.namb.net/apologetics/resource/the-three-i-s-of-scripture-inspired-interrant-infallible/\" class=\"_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">Southern Baptist North American Mission Board</a> has to say:</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\"><em class=\"_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE\">\"God breathed out His Word by using godly men to write down exactly what He wanted them to write. ... The Bible is inspired: God is its ultimate author. The Bible is inerrant: God used human authors to write exactly what He wanted without error. The Bible is infallible: It is incapable of error and will accomplish exactly what God wants.</em></p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">But here's the problem: if Christians <em class=\"_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE\">really believe</em> this, why does it matter who wrote the gospels, why does it matter that the authors of the gospels were eyewitnesses? Anyone could have written the gospels inerrantly if in fact it was ultimately God who was telling them \"exactly what to write\" and was ensuring that what they wrote was \"without error\".</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">I propose that the only reasonable explanation is that -- lip service aside -- these Christians who insist the gospels had to be written by eyewitnesses no longer <em class=\"_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE\">actually</em> have faith that the NT was divinely \"authored\" by God via the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, which is understandable, because it's frankly hard to reconcile such a belief with the numerous discrepancies (and other problems) that are obviously present in the gospels (as we see presented on virtually a daily basis in this sub). In other words, they lack faith that these texts were actually divinely inspired, and so hope to bolster the reliability of the gospels by claiming they are eyewitness testimony, something that should be completely unnecessary if they were divinely inspired.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">As an aside, let me also explain why I think this is unethical / dangerous:</p><ul class=\"_33MEMislY0GAlB78wL1_CR\"><li class=\"_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">It's a common tactic for religious cults to hide their dirty laundry from their children and new recruits, to lead them along with simple and easy stories and beliefs until they are safely \"in the fold\", only for them to later discover that the reality is not what they were taught. As one of many examples, we know Scientologists hid information about Xenu from the rank and file for decades, only exposing it to a select few. Obviously, such behavior is deceptive and unethical.</p></li><li class=\"_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">It's also extremely brittle. Just like it's very easy these days for Scientologists to learn about Xenu, it's very easy these days for Christians to get exposed to the academic consensus concerning the authorship of the gospels -- a consensus that's generally pretty easy to validate on your own by reading the relevant portions of the NT and 2nd-century references -- which means that this alone can act as a wedge that starts Christians questioning the truth of what they have been taught.</p></li></ul><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">In my opinion, this is one of several serious clefts in Christian belief that is adding to the exodus of Christians from the faith. Christians need to decide whether the NT is accurate because it's divinely inspired -- in which case they need to come up with a reasonable explanation for how it can be so problematic -- or that it is accurate because it was written by eyewitnesses or people relying on the direct testimony of eyewitnesses -- which is going to be a tough sell for the reasons described above -- or some other TBD explanation.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">[** The one well-known exception I should address is Papias, who later church fathers quote as claiming that there were \"writings\" attributed to Matthew and Mark in the very early second century. The well-established problem is that the description of these \"writings\" does not match the gospels attributed to those evangelists in the NT. Specifically, Papias states that Matthew's writings were in Hebrew, whereas the scholarly consensus is that the Gospel of Matthew was <em class=\"_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE\">originally</em> written in Greek, and also suggests these consist just of <em class=\"_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE\">logia</em> , or \"divine sayings, especially one spoken by Jesus\". Likewise, he says that Mark \"made it his one concern not to omit anything he had heard\", which is hard to believe applies to the Gospel of Mark, since that gospel lacks things like the Lord's Prayer or any stories about Jesus appearing after his resurrection. As a result, Papias is not only not a reliable attribution concerning who wrote the gospels, he demonstrates why it's reasonable to question the accuracy of the \"tradition\" handed down by the earliest Christians.]</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  \"  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  \"  >  T  h  e     i  n  s  i  s  t  e  n  c  e     b  y     m  o  s  t     C  h  r  i  s  t  i  a  n  s     t  h  a  t     t  h  e     g  o  s  p  e  l  s     w  e  r  e     a  u  t  h  o  r  e  d     b  y     e  y  e  w  i  t  n  e  s  s  e  s     s  h  o  w  s     t  h  e  y     l  a  c  k     f  a  i  t  h     t  h  a  t     t  h  e     H  o  l  y     S  p  i  r  i  t     d  i  v  i  n  e  l  y     i  n  s  p  i  r  e  d     t  h  e  s  e     t  e  x  t  s  <  /  h  1  >"},

It also claims to contain the sayings and teachings of the Son of this God, and the Teacher who paved the way to salvation. The problem is, this is simply not true. The Bible contains numerous contradictions, errors, barbarism, absurdities, and other embarrassing things, some of which will be listed below.  Others will follow if necessary. I would like to do this kind of post in regards to other holy books, like the Quran or BoM, but that\u2019s for another time. Contradictions: A really awkward one appears in Chronicles and Samuel. There\u2019s a story where David has a census, and god gets ticked off. Then he makes a bunch of people in Israel get sick. It\u2019s a fairly straightforward story, but there exists a serious contradiction. One account says that God rose up against Israel, but another said that it was Satan. Another one exists in the genealogy of Jesus (a minor one, but still). They are wildly different, which obviously doesn\u2019t bode well. Or perhaps you could consult Moses. He says he saw God in Genesis 32, but John 1:18 says that no one has seen god. Which is it? Is Moses lying? Is he wrong? On the subject of morals, the Bible clearly has none. In the OT, slavery, rape, and genocide are all condoned by god to various degrees.Numbers 31, deut 20, and 1 Samuel 15 are the best examples. God permits slavery in passages like Lev 20, Ex 20-21, and others. Deuteronomy 22 says that a raped woman must marry her rapist. That\u2019s messed up. Numbers 31:18 says that kidnapping young Midianite girls and taking them for sex slaves is fine. And on and on and on.<br>For errors, the Bible has them in abundance. It repeatedly makes claims that are simply not true. It claims that there was a mass exodus from Egypt by Israel (I\u2019ve also done a debate about this in this sub recently too) it claims that a senior citizen with no shipbuilding knowledge built a giant boat with all the animals. That is plainly ridiculous. It also talks about a garden of Eden, which doesn\u2019t exist. There are still more, and I wouldn\u2019t just unload them all on the first post. My point is this: the Bible cannot be trusted in its moral, historical, or scientific claims. If none of these claims hold to basic scrutiny, how can it be the word of God?</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  \"  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  \"  >  T  h  e     B  i  b  l  e     i  s     n  o  t     d  i  v  i  n  e  l  y     i  n  s  p  i  r  e  d  .  <  /  h  1  >"},

A judge has no right to judge if they won't even follow their own rules and laws.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">\"God\" says not to murder (And he is right with this one. Murder is entirely immoral. Self defense is one thing but murder is not right) but then turns around and kills numerous people. One can argue the instances of him ordering followers to kill others as self-defense (Though that is wrong because they murdered babies and children in cold blood NOT self-defense) but when \"god\" directly kills or causes deaths? He sins. As nothing poses a threat to him so it cannot be self-defense thus it is cold blooded  murder no matter how you try to justify it.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Then there is \"god's love\" which again is a lie. \"god\" has no love and thus is nothing</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">What does the Bible itself say?</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">1 Corinthians 13: 1-13</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">If I give all I possess to the poor and surrender my body to the flames, but have not love, I gain nothing.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Love is patient, love is kind.

But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">For we know in part and we prophesy in part, but when perfection comes, the imperfect disappears.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put childish ways behind me.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">\"god\" however is jealous. \"god\" gets angered easily. \"god\" does keep track of your wrong doings and only forgets them with conditions you must meet.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">In all honesty \"god\" being afraid of us makes what Jesus said make more sense. Jesus came to divide us. To set us upon one another. Father against son, mother against daughter.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">And really that is all that needs to be said. Just this things bars him from having any right to judge us. And proves that the \"god\" of the christian bible is either nothing, the Bible is entirely wrong, or that the bible is made up. And writing this I had an epiphany: What if that is the point of the Bible? To show that absolutely no one has the right to judge someone else not even \"god\"? And let me guess... \"if \"god\" is scared of us then he has the right to kill us in self-defense.\" No. Killing to stay in power is also sinful and wrong. These things are in the Bible itself so you as christians CANNOT deny them. That would mean you are denying your bibles. Or perhaps the Gnostic faith is right and Jesus was a double agent chosen by the real God to give us the answer on how to deal with the fake \"god\"</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">EDIT: What if... what if the Bible is a mirror? What you see and are angered by is a reflection of the self? And the message is God will not judge you ever because he is said to be love thus if God won't judge you becuse he is love what right do you have to judge others? What right do you have to not love others?</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  \"  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  \"  >  T  h  e     C  h  r  i  s  t  i  a  n     \"  G  o  d  \"     i  s     n  o  t     f  i  t     t  o     j  u  d  g  e     a  n  y  o  n  e     a  n  d     i  s     s  c  a  r  e  d     o  f     u  s     b  e  c  a  u  s  e     h  e     i  s     n  o  t  h  i  n  g  .  <  /  h  1  >"},

If we critically examine our \"givens\" -- the pieces of information we are taking for granted or assuming <em class=\"_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE\">a priori</em> -- we will find that a lot of the arguments about religion are based on assumptions that are unsound. I believe the best example of this is the brute fact of existence.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">The question has famously been asked, \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_there_is_anything_at_all\" class=\"_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">Why is there anything at all?</a>\" or \"Why is there something rather than nothing?\" There can't be a causal answer to this question, nothing can \"cause\" existence, because the cause must have existed. If we pull this string far enough, we are forced to accept the Brute Fact of Existence. Something simply was, and we cannot pull the string any farther.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">The brute fact of existence has devastating consequences for the ideological framework that underscores religious arguments and demonstrates how that framework is infected by biased thinking and assumptions. The idea that something \"simply exists\" is intuitively offensive to mankind. The lack of an explanation is an assault on the senses, and our pattern recognition immediately seeks one. \"God\" is a prophylactic for this problem. The mysterious, reverent, and all-powerful nature of such a thing is easier to accept in the circumstances, however, to accept it is to not critical examine our givens.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">We must accept that something \"simply exists.\" How we extrapolate this fact is extremely perilous. Every single religious argument does so by refusing to critical examine their givens. I will go through the main arguments and demonstrate this.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\"><strong class=\"_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU\">Argument from Contingency:</strong></p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">The argument from contingency claims that some things are \"contingent\" and other things are \"necessary\" and that contingent things depend on necessary things to exist. It could be said, for example, that an atom \"depends on\" protons, neutrons, and electrons to exist, and in that way it is \"contingent.\"</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">However, this does not let us arrive at deity, as science knows that there are fundamental particles that are not composed of other things, which satisfy this specific rendition of \"necessary\" vs \"contingent.\"</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">There are other renditions, but they fail to withstand scrutiny. For example, it has been proposed that the fact that particles move within spacetime and can be moved by other particles suggests that they are contingent, but this is clearly dissimilar to the \"compositional\" contingency referred to earlier, and shouldn't be conflated. We have gone from \"composed of other things\" vs \"not composed of other things\" to \"unchangeable/immoveable\" vs \"changeable/movable.\"</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">This does not withstand scrutiny, as there is no basis for supposing that \"non-compositional\" objects must also be \"immoveable.\" It's merely a semantic sleight-of-hand to compile both attributes into this framework called \"contingency.\" Remember that we are scrutinizing our \"givens.\" Why do we assume that the brute fact of existence constitutes an \"immoveable/unchangeable\" object? After all, location and existence are not identical concepts, and it cannot be said that a particle stops existing once it moves elsewhere.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\"><strong class=\"_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU\">First Cause</strong></p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">The above argument flows quite neatly into the first cause argument, which supposes that the causal chain of reality must hit a stopping point, which is therefore God. This approach also fails to critical examine one's givens.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">For an object to exist, it must have properties. We know that there is something rather than nothing. This something has properties.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Given that something simply exists, we must ask -- what reason do we have to dictate the properties of this initial something as being conscious or divine? There cannot be a causal mechanism for the initial state of affairs, definitionally, and given the brute fact of existence, we have to accept that this state simply was. Therefore, what reason do we have to assume that it is something resembling a divine personal conscious deity, rather than a Big Bang scenario, like the one we actually know existed?</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">This is, of course, assuming that there was an \"initial state\" at all rather than a perpetual state of change, which is another poorly scrutinized \"given.\" Physicists do not regard the finitism of the universe as a foregone conclusion, it's still very much an open question!</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Some shift this to say that it's not about the universe or it's finitism, but rather, suggesting there is a different causal axis that God would be on, that must exist for the universe to have it's causal chain. Again, we must scrutinize our assumptions. If this were true, we would be accepting that a deity \"simply exists\" and set our universe into motion. Why would we assume that rather than the possibility that the universe necessarily had the function of being in motion, or being poised to set into motion in it's initial state?</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">An argument that relies on assigning properties to an eternal necessary being is indefensible, as those properties can quite easily apply to the natural universe.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\"><strong class=\"_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU\">Fine Tuning Argument</strong></p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Fine Tuning makes a similar error in it's failure to examine it's givens. We do not know if there was an initial state of existence or if the universe is infinite. Or at least, physicists don't know and I am not arrogant enough to place myself above them.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">The argument goes that certain conditions within the universe allowed for life which, if altered, would not allow life. It's circularly obvious that if conditions allow for life, there are conceivable conditions which do not allow for life.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Sometimes the \"compelling\" portion of this argument relies on the claim that small changes would render life moot, so the universe must be \"fine-tuned\" for us to exist at all. However, this presupposes that there cannot be other forms of life which would've arisen in these other conditions. This argument merely represents our inability to \"know what we don't know.\"</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">This model can more or less be represented in every major religious argument -- a lack of scrutiny applied to <em class=\"_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE\">a priori</em> assumptions, and confirmation bias.</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  \"  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  \"  >  T  h  e     B  r  u  t  e     F  a  c  t     o  f     E  x  i  s  t  e  n  c  e     &  a  m  p  ;     C  o  n  f  i  r  m  a  t  i  o  n     B  i  a  s     -     a     f  a  t  a  l     f  l  a  w     i  n     e  v  e  r  y     r  e  l  i  g  i  o  u  s     a  r  g  u  m  e  n  t  <  /  h  1  >"},

With that consideration in mind that throughout time there have been systems of belief created that were deemed \"religions\" at some point or another.</p></li></ul><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">There reason I wish to start with this point is that I want to introduce the notion that it is possible for humans to fabricate systems of belief, more specifically religions.</p><hr class=\"_2ACwpV3Y0LKhHHKbsxNmmY\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Throughout the history of religion, a point that was always problematic to me, was that many of them seemed to heavily rely on humans to relay the central \"truth\" of that given religion. Usually this is through \"prophets\" or similar in the whole \"person in authority who communes with God\" to then relay given messages on etc. Many of the God(s) of the worlds religions seemingly favor this approach; Judaism, the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Religion, Islam, Native American Indian religions, Hinduism and Christianity, as a few examples.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">However, the reason this is problematic should be obvious. It is also the exact same way that any given charlatan or fraud would set about fabricating their own system of belief for others to follow, for nefarious reasons. If you had a mechanism to help you reliably, accurately and consistently discern, or test, whether a given person genuinely liaised with God, then this might aleviate some of the issues associated with that. Another issue is whether the human that God chose to impart a message to, heard it correctly or not, they are fallible humans, they could have misinterpreted the message.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">However, it seems quite clear that there is no mechanism that can reliably, accurately and consistently figure out whether a given person genuinely received instruction from God, nor whether the message they received, as a fallible humanbeing, was received correctly.</p><hr class=\"_2ACwpV3Y0LKhHHKbsxNmmY\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">The following observations/comments that I feel are very reasonable, can be made.</p><ul class=\"_33MEMislY0GAlB78wL1_CR\"><li class=\"_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">One. If man is simply fabricating systems of belief, based on idealistic fantasy, then it makes complete sense that the only mechanism for that message of \"truth\" to be circulated around, especially pre modern technology, was by oral tradition and/or writing it down.</p></li><li class=\"_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Two. Despite the general favoritism by many religions to use the above mentioned method, we have yet to have any God(s) associated with them to unmistakably clear up the confusion, \"misinterpretation\" and outright flaws in many of the messages passed on in that manner.</p></li><li class=\"_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Three. If there is no mechanism to reliably discern the validty of a \"prophetic\" claim or the claim of any given person to have \"spoken\" with God, then it makes any given set of beliefs that spawn out of that no more credible than any other. In fact, we have plenty of examples of clearly madeup/fabricated religious systems of belief which convinced many people to follow and some of those having resulted in atrocities (the Jonestown massacre an infamous example). You could quite credibly argue that we have contemporary examples in things like Mormonism as \"made up\".</p></li><li class=\"_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Three A. Another hallmark of there being no mechanism to fact or error check those claims, is that they will result in disagreements on those beliefs over time, resulting in people splitting off of a once central system of beliefs. As people disagree and with no way to reliably, accurately and consistently method confirm the truth of \"God\" communication, people can just make their own version of what they think is \"true\" and have the freedom to follow that and convince others it is true too.</p></li></ul><hr class=\"_2ACwpV3Y0LKhHHKbsxNmmY\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">To conclude: We know people make systems of beliefs up, that those systems can eventually make their way to be a \"religious\" belief is also entirely possible and a reasonable assumption. It is too much a conicidence that so many religions (particularly the major ones) rely on humans to spread their messages of truth, in place of some clearly/undeniable message which would be totally within the power of God(s) of those religions to impart on us (if they do actually exist). Considering the clear problems with the error-prone/fallible nature of humans, it makes no sense for any God(s) of different religions to constantly rely on them to impart the all-important truth. Furthermore, considering the amount of hatred, intolerence and bloodshed that has occurred as a result of specifically religious disagreements, it highlights how imperitive it is for the God(s) of those religions to clear the confusion up and/or use a more reliable system for their message.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Overall, almost everything you would expect from humans making up religious systems of belief, is almost exactly what we see of them, with plenty of undeniable examples. We don't see anything undeniably of \"God(s/ly)\" origin in the persistence of religious systems of belief, just slight variations of the same oral and/or written tradition. We see the same issues between religions (i.e denominations and shisms) and almost none of them presenting any reliable, accurate and consistent method to do away with \"wrong\" denominations/shisms and bring it back to the central truth.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Now of course this does not demonstrate with any direct conclusivity that all religions are simply man-made systems of belief. But it does provide several lines of evidence and good reasons to be incredibly suspect of all religions. That we should be expecting a high threshold of evidence and thorough demonstrations that address the issues above. If I were to focus on a specific issue it is that we have no way to tell the difference between someone who is insane, or intentially making things up when compared to someone who is a prophet or genuinely receiving instruction from God.</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  \"  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  \"  >  T  h  e     f  a  c  t     t  h  a  t     t  h  e     w  o  r  l  d  '  s     r  e  l  i  g  i  o  n  s     (  s  p  e  c  i  f  i  c  a  l  l  y     t  h  e     m  a  j  o  r     o  n  e  s  )     a  l  l     s  e  e  m  i  n  g  l  y     r  e  l  y     o  n     h  u  m  a  n     m  e  t  h  o  d  s     t  o     r  e  l  a  y     t  h  e     \"  t  r  u  t  h  \"     o  f     t  h  e  i  r     c  e  n  t  r  a  l     c  l  a  i  m  s     i  s     m  o  r  e     i  n  d  i  c  a  t  i  v  e     o  f     t  h  e  m     b  e  i  n  g     p  u  r  e  l  y     a     r  e  s  u  l  t     o  f     h  u  m  a  n     f  a  b  r  i  c  a  t  i  o  n     r  a  t  h  e  r     t  h  a  n     f  r  o  m     a  c  t  u  a  l     G  o  d  (  s  )  .  <  /  h  1  >"},

But at the same time, that subjective rating <em class=\"_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE\">objectively</em> exists; <em class=\"_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE\">you</em> cannot change <em class=\"_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE\">your</em> mind about what Critic believes and have it be equally true to what they actually, <em class=\"_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE\">objectively</em> believe.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">So from that conception of objectivity, if God exists, then even though He could change morality, even though it is subjective <em class=\"_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE\">to Him</em>, it is objective <em class=\"_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE\">to us</em>. Because it doesn't matter if you disagree with God, you don't change that reality by changing the state of <em class=\"_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE\">your</em> mind. Laws are subjective to the whims of the current government, but good luck arguing in any court that that means they don't objectively exist.</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  \"  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  \"  >  E  v  e  r  y  t  h  i  n  g     t  h  a  t     e  x  i  s  t  s  ,     e  x  i  s  t  s     o  b  j  e  c  t  i  v  e  l  y  <  /  h  1  >"},

As Thomas Henry Huxley put it; \u201chow it is that any thing so remarkable as a state of consciousness comes about as the result of irritating nervous tissue, is just as unaccountable as the appearance of the Djin when Aladdin rubbed his lamp.\u201d</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">\u2022 Free will: many atheists dismiss free will, believing that the universe is deterministic in nature. This presents a problem, as Dr. Angus Menuge puts it; \u201cbefore we can talk of being responsible for our decisions, we need an account of why those decisions belong to us. But the trouble is, on a naturalistic view, there is no entity that can plausibly own any mental states, there is simply a plurality of parallel, impersonal processes in the brain.\u201d</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">\u2022 Purpose: the fact that we feel in us an intrinsic purpose contradicts the nihilism inherent in naturalism.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">\u2022 Reason (math, science, etc.): reason requires the existence of immaterial things, as C. S. Lewis puts it: \u201cIf minds are wholly dependent on brains, and brains on biochemistry, and biochemistry (in the long run) on the meaningless flux of the atoms, I cannot understand how the thought of those minds should have any more significance than the sound of the wind in the trees.\u201d</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">\u2022 Objective moral facts: what justification is there that obviously bad things are \u201cbad\u201d? As Stuart Goetz and Charles Taliafero put it, \u201cit is not clear how one can establish normative values on the basis of processes that are ultimately thoroughly unconscious, nonnormative, and contingent in nature.\u201d</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">In conclusion, there are a variety of immaterial things that naturalism cannot explain, so it is therefore impossible for it to be true.</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  \"  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  \"  >  A  r  g  u  m  e  n  t  s     a  g  a  i  n  s  t     n  a  t  u  r  a  l  i  s  m  .  <  /  h  1  >"},

Dead brain = dead consciousness. You will no longer continue to have experience for as long as time continues to churn.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">I do feel as though a lot of us non-theists take eternal oblivion for granted, and the most basic assumption for the question \"what happens after we die\", I do believe there are small holes to this theory.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">A lot of this mainly comes from the anecdotes (unfortunately) of hundreds of people who have had near-death experiences. For the sake of the argument, let's ignore cases that could potentially be explained \"hypoxia\" \"DMT\"...etc. Mainly cases that do conveniently seem like hallucinations of otherworldly dimensions, of heaven, of hell...etc.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Instead, veridical near death experiences, in which the experiencer is highly unlikely to have conscious awareness of anything, is able to have awareness of events that can be corroborated. 'Peak in Darien' experiences are also interesting as they involve cases in which the experiencer has visions of people that, unbeknownst to them, were dead.  Brain activity is thought to cease 10-20 seconds after cardiac arrest. Brain damage from hypoxia/cardiac arrest is thought to ensue in 9-10 minutes. In many of these cases, flat EEGs were observed, and the experience is thought to have occurred during the time frame of minuscule brain activity.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Under a purely physical conception of the mind (my views still align mainly with physicalism), it seems intuitively impossible for such an experience to occur. Yet, in both NDE types, the experience seems to pick up on information they shouldn't have picked up on.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">The most well-known case seems to be that of Pam Reynolds;</p><blockquote class=\"_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">In 1991, aged 35, Reynolds experienced symptoms of dizziness, loss of speech and difficulty moving her body. A CT scan revealed a giant aneurysm at the base of her brain. The neurologist to whom she was referred predicted little or no chance of survival; because of its size and location, regular neurosurgical techniques to excise it would not work. She was then referred to Dr Robert Spetzler in Phoenix, Arizona, who had pioneered a surgical procedure, hypothermic cardiac arrest, that would make the aneurysm operable. This involved cooling the patient\u2019s body to sixty degrees Fahrenheit, stopping the heartbeat and breathing, and draining all blood from the brain.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">More than twenty doctors, nurses and technicians took part. The operation required Reynolds\u2019s vital signs and body temperature to be very closely monitored by multiple instruments placed in various locations on and within her body. Molded speakers were placed in her ears, producing clicks at regular intervals, so that other instruments could detect her brain\u2019s reactions to them.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Reynolds was awake when she was brought into the operating room at 7:15 am. She felt a \u2018loss of time\u2019 and blanked out as the general anaesthesia took effect. Then she became aware of a musical tone that seemed to pull her out of the top of her head.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\"><strong class=\"_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU\">The further out of my body I got, the more clear the tone became. I had the impression it was like a road, a frequency that you go on \u2026 I remember seeing several things in the operating room when I was looking down. It was the most aware that I think that I have ever been in my entire life \u2026 It was brighter and more focused and clearer than normal vision \u2026 There was so much in the operating room that I didn\u2019t recognize, and so many people.</strong></p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">She recalled being surprised that the team had only partially shaved her head. She also recalled seeing the bone-saw Spetzler used to excise a section of her skull:</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\"><strong class=\"_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU\">The saw thing \u2026 looked like an electric toothbrush and it had a dent in it, a groove at the top where the saw appeared to go into the handle, but it didn\u2019t \u2026 And the saw had interchangeable blades, too, but these blades were in what looked like a socket wrench case \u2026 I heard the saw crank up.</strong></p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">She found this sound unpleasant. <strong class=\"_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU\">\u2018Someone said something about my veins and arteries being very small,\u2019 Reynolds recalled, adding that it was a female voice. At this stage in the operation, a female cardiac surgeon, having determined that the arteries in Reynolds\u2019s right leg were too small to handle the degree of blood flow required by the heart-lung machine, opened the left leg as well.</strong></p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Spetzler assessed the aneurysm and ordered hypothermic cardiac arrest to be performed. Commencing at 10:50 am, blood was removed via tubes from the femoral arteries and veins, chilled in reservoir cylinders and returned to her body. As Reynolds\u2019s core temperature fell, her heartbeat changed to fibrillation, then stopped entirely. Her brainwaves flattened, then, as her core temperature reached sixty, the brainstem shut down. By standard definitions she was clinically dead.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">At 11:25 the heart-lung machine was turned off, the operating table was tilted and blood was drained from her body. The sac of the aneurysm, now empty, was easily excised. The heart-lung machine was then reactivated and warmed blood reinfused into Reynolds\u2019s circulatory system. The brainstem slowly began showing activity again, then her higher brain also, as the warming process continued. At noon it became apparent that her heart would not resume beating by warming alone; electrical jolts from a defibrillator were used to shock it into starting. Having been clinically dead for about an hour, Reynolds was returned to the recovery room in a stable condition at 2:10 pm.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">As cited by Sabom, Reynolds\u2019s next recollections fall between the mention of her arteries being too small, and the time Spetzler\u2019s younger assistants were closing her incisions:</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\"><strong class=\"_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU\">There was a sensation like being pulled, but not against your will. I was going on my own accord because I wanted to go. I have different metaphors to try to explain this. It was like the Wizard of Oz \u2013 being taken up in a tornado vortex, only you\u2019re not spinning around like you\u2019ve got vertigo. You\u2019re very focused and you have a place to go. The feeling was like going up in an elevator real fast. And there was a sensation, but it wasn\u2019t a bodily, physical sensation. It was like a tunnel but it wasn\u2019t a tunnel. At some point very early in the tunnel vortex I became aware of my grandmother calling me. But I didn\u2019t hear her call me with my ears \u2026 It was a clearer hearing than with my ears. I trust that sense more than I trust my own ears. The feeling was that she wanted me to come to her, so I continued with no fear down the shaft. It\u2019s a dark shaft that I went through, and at the very end there was this very little tiny pinpoint of light that kept getting bigger and bigger and bigger. The light was incredibly bright, like sitting in the middle of a lightbulb. It was so bright that I put my hands in front of my face fully expecting to see them and I could not. But I knew they were there. Not from a sense of touch. Again, it\u2019s terribly hard to explain, but I knew they were there \u2026 I noticed that as I began to discern different figures in the light \u2013 and they were all covered with light, they were light, and had light permeating all around them \u2013 they began to form shapes I could recognize and understand. I could see that one of them was my grandmother. I don\u2019t know if it was reality or projection, but I would know my grandmother, the sound of her, anytime, anywhere.Everyone I saw, looking back on it, fit perfectly into my understanding of what that person looked like at their best during their lives. I recognized a lot of people. My uncle Gene was there. So was my great-great-Aunt Maggie, who was really a cousin. On Papa\u2019s side of the family, my grandfather was there \u2026 They were specifically taking care of me, looking after me.They would not permit me to go further \u2026 It was communicated to me \u2013 that\u2019s the best way I know how to say it, because they didn\u2019t speak like I\u2019m speaking \u2013 that if I went all the way into the light something would happen to me physically. They would be unable to put this me back into the body me, like I had gone too far and they couldn\u2019t reconnect. So they wouldn\u2019t let me go anywhere or do anything. Then they were feeding me. They were not doing this through my mouth, like with food, but they were nourishing me with something. The only way I know how to put it is something sparkly. Sparkles is the image that I get. I definitely recall the sensation of being nurtured and being fed and being made strong. I know it sounds funny, because obviously it wasn\u2019t a physical thing, but inside the experience I felt physically strong, ready for whatever. My grandmother didn\u2019t take me back through the tunnel, or even send me back or ask me to go. She just looked up at me. I expected to go with her, but it was communicated to me that she just didn\u2019t think she would do that. My uncle said he would do it. He\u2019s the one who took me back through the end of the tunnel. Everything was fine. I did want to go. But then I got to the end of it and saw the thing, my body. I didn\u2019t want to get into it \u2026 It looked terrible, like a train wreck. It looked like what it was: dead. I believe it was covered. It scared me and I didn\u2019t want to look at it.

Startled by the noise, Greyson dropped his fork, splashing tomato sauce everywhere, including on his tie. He cursed under his breath as he wiped the sauce off with a wet napkin. It would leave a stain that would change the course of his life.\u00a0</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">As Greyson details in his book <em class=\"_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE\">After: A Doctor Explores What Near-Death Experiences Reveal About Life and Beyond,</em> after dialling the number on the pager\u2019s display, he learned that a woman called Holly was in the emergency room following a drug overdose. Greyson grabbed his lab coat, buttoning it up to hide the stain on his tie, before heading down to the ER.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">He found Holly unconscious but in a stable state and after doing some routine checks, went to the family lounge at the far end of the hallway. There Holly\u2019s roommate Susan was pacing back and forth. Feeling a little hot in the windowless room, Greyson undid his lab coat and moved a fan closer to him, before sitting down to talk to Susan.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">He questioned Susan about her roommate, trying to establish if Holly may have been doing drugs or suffering from mental health problems. At one point he thought he saw Susan shudder slightly.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">After concluding the chat, he returned to Holly\u2019s room where she was still out cold, a \u2018sitter\u2019 confirming that she hadn\u2019t stirred since he left the room. Greyson left for the night, quietly congratulating himself that no one had noticed his sauce stain.\u00a0</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">When he returned to the hospital the next morning, Holly was now awake and able to talk. He introduced himself to Holly, who responded with a sentence that would dumbfound Greyson.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">\u201cI know who you are.

There is much more literature on these type of cases, and since it is 2 AM and I am half-asleep, I cannot reference all the stories I wish I could.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Although anecdotes, they may suggest that consciousness is weirder than we think it is. And if consciousness can extend beyond an incapacitated brain during an NDE, then it <em class=\"_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE\">may</em> suggest it can continue on after the brain dies. More non-anecdotal studies have to be done on this phenomenon, which is what the AWARE I and AWARE II studies are attempting to do, before we may fully suggest that the mind can continue to be aware of things after clinical death. These two studies managed to get 2-3 hits overall, with 2 patients being able to recall information that could be corroborated in AWARE I and 1 auditory hit (aka, awareness of deliberate auditory targets) in AWARE II.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">I am still totally agnostic about the existence of consciousness after death, especially with regards to consciousness after permanent, brain death. But things like these do open a small window of hope and opportunity. That we may not be subjected to an eternity of nothingness after we die.</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  \"  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  \"  >  e  t  e  r  n  a  l     o  b  l  i  v  i  o  n  ,     a  l  b  e  i  t     t  h  e     m  o  s  t     l  i  k  e  l  y     p  o  s  s  i  b  i  l  i  t  y     f  o  r     d  e  a  t  h  ,     i  s  n  '  t     1  0  0  %     g  u  a  r  a  n  t  e  e  d  <  /  h  1  >"},

Then there are the actions of Bible God himself, which - by the standards of modern society - are a bit lacking in the morality department.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">There was the time God killed a man for an honest mistake:</p><blockquote class=\"_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">1 Corinthians 13</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\"><strong class=\"_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU\">9</strong>\u00a0When they came to the threshing floor of Kidon, Uzzah reached out his hand to steady the ark, because the oxen stumbled.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\"><strong class=\"_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU\">10</strong>\u00a0The Lord\u2019s anger burned against Uzzah, and he struck him down because he had put his hand on the ark.

{"title": "<h1 class=\"_eYtD2XCVieq6emjKBH3m\">There is no such thing as a \"supernatural claim\" and nothing outside naturalism.</h1>", "content": "<div class=\"_3xX726aBn29LDbsDtzr_6E _1Ap4F5maDtT1E1YuCiaO0r D3IL3FD0RFy_mkKLPwL4\" style=\"max-width:800px\" data-click-id=\"text\" data-adclicklocation=\"media\"><div class=\"_292iotee39Lmt0MkQZ2hPV RichTextJSON-root\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">There is no such thing as a \"supernatural claim\" and nothing outside naturalism.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">First a little background. The only thing outside the realm of science is that which is subjective. So fair play: the subjective might be outside naturalism. Science cannot tell us if we watched a \"good game\". You and I may watch the same game and decide it was good or bad and we can both be right even if we have opposing opinions. Science is of no use here.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Second, for anything objectively true... anything that is true for everyone everywhere at the same time... that is within the realm of science, reason, and naturalism. For example, if we wanted to ask \"Did a game take place?\" We could use science, reason, and naturalism to find an answer.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Third, a limitation of technology does not put an objective thing outside the realm of science. For example, we can all agree that we can use science to know where the moon will be at any given date. We can use telescopes, mathematics, and other techniques to know this. If we ask, \"Where will the moon be in 100 years from this moment\" it's a matter of science. If we had never invented telescopes it would still be a matter of science. Because it's an objective phenomenon.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Fourth, any truth claim about reality that's objective falls under the realm of science. This includes religious miracles. They either happened or they didn't. It's a fact or a falsehood. Jesus either walked on water or he didn't. It's impossible for him to have walked on water for me AND to have (somehow) not walked on water for you. If there were any science that supported it, you can bet that Christians would absolutely be screaming their heads off about it to anyone who would listen.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">The conclusion we come to is to see so-called \"supernatural claims\" for what they are: failed scientific hypotheses that are so resoundingly nonsensical that their chance of being true is best described as \"so low to be as good as false\". Most theists have been taught (often from the time they can speak) that claims about their own religion either don't require evidence (\"Faith!\") or operate under a different set of bad logical rules (\"Because GOD that's why\"). When disarmed of this illogic and forced to use the same consistent logic everyone else uses (And the same logic theists themselves use for phenomenon outside their religion) the truth becomes clear.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">\"Jesus walked on water\" is a scientific claim and it's one we have no reason to believe. We know water can't be walked upon and the only so-called \"evidence\" theists have is to just heap on more and more unsupported claims and special pleadings. It's like this for every miracle/supernatural claim.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\"><strong class=\"_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU\">EDIT:</strong> So I've made similar arguments before and something that always pops up is \"could there be evidence for [miraculous thing]? It's possible!\"</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">And?</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">We can take ANY unlikely, false, or impossible claim and falsely make it sound more plausible by insisting that some unknown bit of evidence COULD be out there. \"This sentence has no letters in it.\" Does it become any more reasonable if we say \"well there COULD be evidence there's no letters in the previous sentence!\" We haven't gotten any closer to proving the claim. No evidence has been provided. There's still a ton of letters in the sentence. Actual evidence and the possibility of evidence are not interchangeable.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Theists will invoke this to try to lend credibility to unsupported nonsense claims. As though this little smoke and mirrors can (somehow) stand in for evidence. It can't. It's disingenuous. Just an attempt to move the goal posts.</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  \"  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  \"  >  T  h  e  r  e     i  s     n  o     s  u  c  h     t  h  i  n  g     a  s     a     \"  s  u  p  e  r  n  a  t  u  r  a  l     c  l  a  i  m  \"     a  n  d     n  o  t  h  i  n  g     o  u  t  s  i  d  e     n  a  t  u  r  a  l  i  s  m  .  <  /  h  1  >"},

I will list them out below for clarity.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Things that are okay according to Muhammad, but not okay according to modern Western values: marrying a child or anyone more than 30 years younger than you (since ofc there will be Muslims here citing the unbacked sources of Aisha being 17, as if that's perfectly okay by modern western values when Muhammad was minimum 50 at the time), killing people for leaving Islam, not allowing people to be involved with politics/ decision making if they are not Muslim, having multiple wives (but not multiple husbands), having slaves.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">The Quran doesn't have a time limit. It doesn't say \"after 500 years, use the modern cultural values\". It doesn't say \"if Muhammad and your culture don't align, then make sure to use your own culture, because Muhammad may have lived a long time ago\". Instead, it says \"Muhammad is the FINAL prophet, and his message is the FINAL message of God.\"</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">If you choose western values over Muhammad's message, you are not a Muslim. Only the extremists are real Muslims, because only they truly follow the shahada. Reject Muhammad as Prophet = not a Muslim, by any definition of the word.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Also, notice that none of this is addressing what is actually right in an objective sense. The moral relativist trolls can hold their horses. I am not saying if it is good or bad to be Muslim or not, just that Islam is fundamentally incompatible with modern western values, and if you are prioritizing modern western values over Muhammad, then you cannot be a Muslim. Whether that is good or bad, or if the western values are wrong, is up to you.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">[As an aside, the Persians and Byzantines that were Muhammad's contemporaries punished pedophiles. Pedophilia being gross is not new. Saying pedophilia was okay 1300 years ago because Muhammad did it is like saying slavery is okay today because Qatar is doing it. Islam had outdate morals from its very inception, but that's not directly relevant to my main thesis.

Messianic institutions advocate for Trinitarianism. Trinitarianism is a Christian invention not supported by Jewish tradition or the Tanakh. The Christian ideas of the Incarnation and hypostatic union are similarly not supported by Judaism. Judaism teaches that God is one and not a man. Judaism also teaches that the messiah will be a man, not an incarnation of God. Worshipping a man or the Trinity is considered idolatry (avodah zarah) in Judaism. Messianic acceptance of these doctrines places them outside the acceptable boundaries of Judaism. Messianic appeals to the Tanakh on these points are irrelevant, which is explained in the next section.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\"><strong class=\"_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU\">Scripturally</strong>: Christian, not Jewish. In addition to accepting the Christian \"new testament,\" Messianics also adhere to the Protestant doctrine of Sola Scriptura: the idea that the Christian Bible is the sole and infallible source of authority for faith and practice. There are problems with both of these facts. First, the new testament is fundamentally opposed to Judaism and deeply antisemitic. For example, it teaches that the Torah is a curse, advocates disregard for Torah observance, and refers to Jews as children of the devil (and much more). No movement that accepts the new testament can be considered legitimately Jewish for these reasons.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">More importantly, the reliance on Sola Scriptura demonstrates the Protestant nature of this movement. Neither Judaism nor Catholicism accept this idea, instead understanding that scripture is in need of interpretation through a legitimate chain of authority. For a Christian example of the need for interpretation, take the theology of communion. At the Last Supper, Jesus states \"This is my body... This is my blood\" in reference to the bread and wine. Catholics claim this somewhat literally and hold the theology of transubstantiation, i.e. that they are truly his body and blood at the Mass, while most Protestants take a more symbolic approach. The text is not clear one way or the other which theory is correct, and therefore needs an authoritative interpretation, which is provided by the churches. The same principle holds true for Judaism and the interpretation of the Torah.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Sola scriptura was a major innovation of the Protestant Revolution and is an entirely Christian idea. (In point of fact, sola scriptura is self-contradictory because Christian scriptures don't teach it. It is therefore a doctrine dependent on the authority of the church rather than scripture and ironically constitutes a Protestant version of an oral interpretive tradition.) In Judaism, the chain of authority is traced from the rabbis to Moses at Sinai and is referred to as the Oral Torah. The Oral Torah became the Mishnah and with its commentary the Gemarah is known as the Talmud. There is no Judaism without the Talmud. Messianics overwhelmingly reject the authority of the Talmud, halakha, and rabbis generally. Jewish interpretive tradition (Talmud and rabbis) is therefore replaced with the Protestant interpretive tradition (Christian-Bible-Alone Theory). Messianic appeals to Christian interpretations of the Tanakh are therefore irrelevant for the support of their theological claims as a form of Judaism.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\"><strong class=\"_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU\">Ritually</strong>: Christian, not Jewish, but deceptively made to look Jewish. Jewish rituals and ritual items are symbolic expressions of the teachings of Judaism. Because Judaism and Christianity are theologically mutually exclusive, the meanings of these rituals and items must be altered by Messianics to express Christian doctrines. A prime example is the Passover Seder, which Messianics change to make about Jesus's last supper, death, and resurrection rather than the Exodus. In changing the meanings (and often the forms/practice) of these rituals and items, Messianics both disrespect and degrade them. Therefore, when Christians copy Jewish rituals or use ritual items, they become essentially non-Jewish because they have been ripped from their original context and altered.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">It is also hypocritical of Messianics to adopt Jewish rituals and ritual items. Most of these things were either created or given form by the rabbis of the Talmud after the fall of the Temple, which of course happened after Jesus died. For example, the Passover Seder in its current form did not exist in the time of Jesus. Using these rituals and items that are based on rabbinic interpretation while selectively rejecting the authority of the rabbis on other things, e.g. theology, is hypocritical. If they were consistent, they would rely on the teachings of the Bible alone, which would lead to some interesting, and probably laughable, results. However, the reason they do as they do is not because of a desire for consistent theology, but because of their mission to convert Jews. They know if they stray too far from the illusion of standard Jewish ritual, their form of Christianity would not appeal to Jews in the slightest. So, they adopt these rituals for the sake of proselytizing alone and making it appear as though one can convert to Christianity while maintaining a connection to Judaism.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\"><strong class=\"_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU\">Sociologically</strong>: Christian, not Jewish. Many, if not most, members of Messianic churches are gentiles who never converted to Judaism. Of those few members who are ethnically Jewish (either totally or through one parent), they have ceased to practice Judaism, if they did to begin with, because of their conversion to Christianity. According to Jewish law, they are no longer part of the Jewish community and are treated as gentiles with regard to any religious issue. Food they prepare is not considered kosher, for example, and they cannot lead prayer in a synagogue, receive an aliyah, or even be counted in a minyan. They are effectively non-Jewish unless and until they repent and renounce Christianity. The only privilege they retain from their Jewish identity is that they are not required to undergo a conversion upon their return.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Messianics will often argue that this treatment is hypocritical because Jewish Buddhists and atheists, for example, are not treated the same way. Technically speaking, the same restrictions should apply in these situations, however, if the community is more lenient in these cases, it is for two specific reasons. 1) Jewish Buddhists and atheists are not trying to convert Jews away from Judaism, and 2) they are not trying to dishonestly portray Buddhism or atheism as a \"fulfilled,\" \"completed,\" or \"more authentic\" form of Judaism. Furthermore, interest in and adoption of these worldviews are organic phenomena in the Jewish community, whereas Messianics are an intrusive, predatory, outside proselytizing phenomenon created by gentiles.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Messianics will also sometimes claim that if Judaism is a civilization or culture, as taught by Mordecai Kaplan, then their appropriation should be seen as legitimate. This is a misunderstanding of Kaplan. The transvaluation of sancta in Kaplan's theory must be based in the values and traditions of the Jewish community. Kaplan's understanding of God, for example, was a new theological position, but it was fundamentally grounded in the Jewish concept of God. Messianics, however, hold to evangelical theology in toto. It is not rooted in Judaism or Jewish culture, but is an entirely gentile Protestant creation. It therefore is not an example of the organic evolution of Jewish civilization, but is very obviously an imposition and attempt to convert Jews away from Judaism.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">The claim that Christianity began as a Jewish sect is irrelevant to this issue. Christianity became a gentile religion almost immediately after the death of Jesus. By the time of Paul's letters, 20-30 years after Jesus, Christianity was overwhelmingly majority gentile. Christian theology regarding the Trinity and incarnation was a gentile creation, and much of their scriptures (e.g. the gospels and many of the epistles) were obviously written by gentiles unfamiliar with and/or hostile to Judaism. Christianity spent it's most formative first centuries defining itself against Judaism, and it's most influential theologians were not Jews (e.g. Augustine, Origen, Tertullian, etc). Christianity's development over the last two thousand years has been almost entirely in a gentile context, including the Protestant Revolution, which is the most important development for Messianics since their theology is entirely Evangelical Protestant in nature. Christianity is a gentile, not a Jewish creation, and therefore cannot be considered part of Kaplan's theory of Jewish civilization.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\"><strong class=\"_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU\">In Sum</strong>: Messianics are Christians, not Jews in any relevant sense, and their religion is not Judaism. Theologically and scripturally, they are entirely Evangelical. Ritually, despite their appropriation of Jewish ceremonies and ritual items, they are Christian because of their alterations and reasons for doing them. Sociologically, they are mostly gentile Christians, and those who are ethnically Jewish have effectively become non-Jewish according to Jewish law because of their embrace of Christianity. Furthermore, because they are a Christian proselytizing creation, they are not a legitimate outgrowth of Jewish civilization, \u00e0 la Kaplan, and therefore are not given the same leniency as Jewish apostates.</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  \"  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  \"  >  T  h  e     M  e  s  s  i  a  n  i  c     P  h  e  n  o  m  e  n  o  n     i  s     E  n  t  i  r  e  l  y     C  h  r  i  s  t  i  a  n     a  n  d     I  s     N  o  t     a     F  o  r  m     o  f     J  u  d  a  i  s  m  .  <  /  h  1  >"},

My argument is as follows:</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">P1: god exists with omnipotence</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">P2: god has no deficiencies, shortcomings or inadequacies, in other words god 'needs' nothing</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">P3: desire ultimately stems from deficiencies, shortcomings or inadequacies</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">P4: the creation of humans cannot fulfil any need or satisfy any desire that god has</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">C: god created human beings with ultimately no purpose</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">I feel that I must elaborate on the 2nd and 3rd premise as it the most dubious. P2 god has no deficiencies is derived from the fact that an infinite being could theoretically have anything, so a specific desire can't possibly have a purpose. For example, if someone theoretically had an infinite amount of money to spend, they cannot possibly desire more money, fundamentally they \"could\" but why? There would ultimately be no purpose of having more money if you already have an infinite amount to spend. P3 just means that the reason for desire is really just from a lack of things. An example of this is, the desire for food. Why would someone want food? Because of their caloric requirements and their deficiency of requiring food for nutrients. This analogy is hard to relate to god, but you get the point.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">I would like to formally thank anyone who read this far, and for taking the time to respond to my arguments.

I'll be addressing two counterarguments I've not seen before.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">As a quick clarification, I am here assuming that God is a being that can be judged morally (and is judged as a good being) If he <em class=\"_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE\">isn't</em>- if god could make literally the opposite decision in every choice he's ever had and be morally identical- then I have to concede defeat. An amoral god doesn't need defending, but as such a being couldn't be omnibenevolent by simple logic, it's a mutual loss.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">By the same token, if the argument is that God is not a <em class=\"_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE\">being</em> then again, I concede that what is essentially the operating system of the universe has no obligation to end suffering. However, I would also question under what grounds a mindless being entity doesn't do or think anything constitutes a \"God\" in any meaningful sense.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Now, assuming we have a god that is a moral agent (that is, he intentionally acts and his actions can be moral or immoral), three arguments  that an omnibenevolent being couldn't create a world with suffering even granting all acts of evil are caused by humans.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\"><strong class=\"_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU\">The Argument From Shared Guilt</strong></p><ol class=\"_1eJr7K139jnMstd4HajqYP\"><li class=\"_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">God has extreme influence over our actions (even if we grant free will)</p></li><li class=\"_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">If a being you have extreme influence over the actions of commits an immoral act, you share (at least partially) their guilt</p></li><li class=\"_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Humans commit immoral acts</p></li><li class=\"_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Therefore, god is not all-good (as he shares guilt in a number of immoral acts)</p></li></ol><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">God obviously has a huge amount of control over our actions- he created us, he created our brain chemistry, he created our environments, he created everything. He has a strong- maybe total- amount of influence over what we chose. Now, maybe you're a compatiablist and think that doesn't affect free will. I actually agree! But, even granting that the wicked among us do evil things of their own free will, god's influence makes him culpable too.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Let's take a mass shooter. The mass shooter is responsible for his evil acts, obviously. But most mass shooters are incels, so what about those people who promoted that ideology to him? What of demagogues who talked to him about how all women are whores and deserved violent revenge, what of the forum-goers who egged him on? Most would agree that they share the guilt, to some extent.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">As influence gets stronger, so too does shared guilt. For example, we generally consider Hitler completely responsible for all the evil acts of Nazi Germany. It all acted under his orders, in a system he designed, so he holds the blame for the actions of those actors (who, again, are still morally culpable for their part). Note this even includes the actions he was not directly responsble- there were plenty of people killed by the Nazis without any orders from above, but Hitler's control over Germany was such he can still be held responsible. But even the most oppressive tyrant has only a fraction of the control over their minions that God has over us.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">With his extreme control over what we choose, God holds significant moral blame for the actions of evil people <em class=\"_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE\">regardless</em> of whether the evil people do too*.* At best, the Moral Argument shows that humanity and God share equal blame for the state of the world. But of course, we're not claiming to be all good. God is.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">As any evil acts humans do god shares at the very least a significant amount of responsibility for, this world is a moral indictment upon its creator. Ergo, an tri-omni god doesn't exist.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\"><strong class=\"_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU\">The Argument From Immoral Bystanders</strong></p><ol class=\"_1eJr7K139jnMstd4HajqYP\"><li class=\"_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">If you have the power to stop an act of evil and don't, you have done an immoral thing</p></li><li class=\"_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">God has the power to stop acts of evil and doesn't.</p></li><li class=\"_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Ergo, an all-good god can't exist</p></li></ol><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">This is simple. Let us suppose I see a child being beaten to death. Now, this is not my fault. I'm not responsible for the child's attack in any way, I have no blame here. This brutal murder is entirely outside of my responsibility. But surely, even granting this, is it not still immoral for me to sit back and watch?</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Even granting that God is not responsible for the acts of evil in the world, this doesn't discharge the responsibility to <em class=\"_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE\">do</em> something about them. Even if we have pure, libertarian free will and say the mass shooter acted purely uncausedly? Even if we grant a form of omniscience where God didn't know the mass shooter would act until they started shooting? This doesn't change the fact there is still an obligation to stop the mass shooter. You are not only obligated to stop evil you personally caused.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">As the universe has a huge amount of suffering that God could stop but doesn't, there is still a moral implausibility here. Even if God is not responsible for the creation of evil we can still raise the question as to why he didn't destroy it once it came into being, bringing the problem of suffering back into focus.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\"><strong class=\"_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU\">The Argument From Robotics</strong></p><ol class=\"_1eJr7K139jnMstd4HajqYP\"><li class=\"_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">The Free Will defense depends on a being having free will being an overwhelming good.</p></li><li class=\"_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">However, we have good reason to think that granting a being free will can be evil.</p></li><li class=\"_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Ergo, the free will defense doesn't work.</p></li></ol><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">I kind of want to just quote Unravelled here- \"What kind of sicko creates a sapient crash test dummy?\" But I'll expand.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Lets take a bomb disposal robot. Admittedly, we can't make a sentient bomb disposal robot. But suppose we could. AI was advanced enough we could make robots that were as capable of feeling fear and pain as humans. Would it be moral to make the bomb disposal robot sapient?</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Well- no, right? You're creating a mind purely to put it in continuous situations of mortal terror. To give a being a genuine mind rather then a robotic algorithm in a situation where a sapient mind would be undergoing extreme distress is wrong. You can come up with other examples- Sapient video game enemies, say, or the aforementioned sapient crash test dummies. Even if possible, there are situations where its unethical to create a sapient free willed being over a mindless automaton.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Is existence one of those cases?</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Well- lots of it are. Lots of people do experience extreme terror, despair and pain for most or all of those life. Surely, the same standard by which the sapient crash test dummy is monstrous applies here- for such people, you should create a robot. Creating a mind directly into a situation where it will experience extreme suffering is wrong- it is more ethical to make a mindless robot.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">If nothing else, it seems there is no reason for <em class=\"_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE\">animal</em> life to be more then automata in a world so allegedly anthropocentric. Yet, as far as we can tell animals have fully functional minds.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">But in this case, free will is not a counter to the problem of suffering. It is possible for granting a being free will to be an act of evil in and of itself, and it seems like a lot of cases of free willed entities we see are such cases.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Ergo, our world is still a world its immoral to make, and thus an omnibenevolent being doesn't exist</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">TL;DR</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Even granting free will, god still holds moral responsibility for the acts of humans, still holds moral responsibility for not stopping the results of human free will, and still holds moral responsibility for the act of creating conscious self-willed life at all. As these are serious moral charges, free will doesn't resolve the problem of suffering.</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  \"  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  \"  >  F  r  e  e     W  i  l  l     i  s     n  o  t     a     v  a  l  i  d     d  e  f  e  n  s  e     o  f     a  n     O  m  n  i  b  e  n  e  v  o  l  e  n  t     G  o  d  :     a  r  g  u  m  e  n  t  s     f  r  o  m     s  h  a  r  e  d     g  u  i  l  t  ,     t  h  e     i  m  m  o  r  a  l  i  t  y     o  f     b  y  s  t  a  n  d  e  r  s     a  n  d     r  o  b  o  t  i  c  s  .  <  /  h  1  >"},

It has been quite some time since my <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/t60psu/refuting_two_novel_arguments_by_apologetics/\" class=\"_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">last post</a> on here. Today, I briefly return with some reflections on a few relatively recent theodicies, I've come across that I think are difficult to respond to. What is a theodicy? To understand this, we will first need an understanding of the problem of evil.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">The problem of evil is an argument for the non-existence of God which starts with some facts or observations, of evil, or suffering we see in the world. Be it the occurrence of evil and suffering generally, or more concrete horrific examples of evil or suffering such as a Fawn burning to death in a forest fire. There is taken to be two kinds of problem of evil. An <a href=\"https://iep.utm.edu/evil-evi/\" class=\"_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">evidential</a>, and a <a href=\"https://iep.utm.edu/evil-log/\" class=\"_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">logical</a> version. A logical problem of evil, argues that theism and the occurrence of evil are jointly inconsistent. The basic form of such an argument would be as follows.</p><ol class=\"_1eJr7K139jnMstd4HajqYP\"><li class=\"_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">If evil exists, then it's not the case that God exists</p></li><li class=\"_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Evil exists</p></li><li class=\"_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Therefore it's not the case that God exists</p></li></ol><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">An evidential problem of evil on the other hand, argues that the occurrence of the evil we see (Usually, in particular, horrendous, seemingly gratuitous suffering) is highly unlikely on theism. That is, that given the truth of theism, antecedently, it would be very surprising if it turned out there were evils of the sort we observe in this world. There are many ways to formulate such an argument that atheist philosophers have come up with, there are inductive formulations, intuition-based formulations, Bayesian formulations etc. Here is a basic evidential argument from evil.</p><ol class=\"_1eJr7K139jnMstd4HajqYP\"><li class=\"_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">If God exists, then gratuitous evil does not exist</p></li><li class=\"_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Probably, gratuitous evil exists</p></li><li class=\"_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Therefore, probably, God does not exist</p></li></ol><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Gratuitous evil being evil with no morally justifying reason for it's existence.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">There are two ways theists tend to respond to the problem of evil. One would be a defense, another would be a theodicy. A defense is a response to a logical problem of evil, it is a story one can tell, which, when conjoined with theism, makes theism and the existence of evil compossible. The most famous example is Alvin Plantinga's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Plantinga%27s_free-will_defense\" class=\"_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">free will defense</a>. It's important to note that, a defense, does not need to be remotely likely, or plausible, it only needs to be true for all one knows and not entail a logical contradiction.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">A theodicy, on the other hand, is a response to the evidential problem of evil. It is a story which is taken to be both plausible given the truth of theism, and when added to theism, makes the occurrence of the evils we see unsurprising from a probabilistic standpoint. Unlike a defense, a theodicy must be a story which is plausibly actually true, not just true for all one knows. To be a successful theodicy, much more is needed then mere logical coherence since what needs to be shown is not merely that theism is consistent with evil, but that there is no significant evidential tension between theism and observations of evil. A standard example of a theodicy is John Hick's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irenaean_theodicy\" class=\"_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">soul-making theodicy</a>. We will not be discussing the soul-making theodicy today. Instead, I will be addressing more obscure, non-traditional theodicies, that have been discussed on the philosophically sophisticated theist side of YouTube. It is to this, that I now turn.</p><div class=\"_7T4UafM1PdBGycd5na9nF\">The Non-Identity Theodicy</div><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">The first theodicy I will examine is the non-identity theodicy. Before reading this section, I highly recommend watching Apologetic Squared's short <a href=\"https://youtu.be/j1xU3eAq4p0\" class=\"_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">7 minute video</a> on this theodicy or reading the <a href=\"https://philpapers.org/archive/VITNT.pdf\" class=\"_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">original paper</a> on it. I will just give a brief sketch of it.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">The basic idea is this; what makes me, me, and you, you, is our essential properties. And, the story goes, our essential properties include (and are possibly exhausted by) facts about our origins, indeed very specific facts about our origins, including the total causal history which has resulted in ones coming-to-be, our ancestral history, and evolutionary history. But this history includes a lot of suffering. So, God permits this suffering to bring about you, and me, that is you and me in particular. If God did not allow such suffering, then you wouldn't exist, rather someone else would, with some other set of essential properties. God's intention is to bring about us in particular, you, me, Jim and Bob across the street, etc. He views bringing about us in particular, as a valuable end in itself, such that the means he uses to achieve such an end, which includes vast amounts of horrific suffering, makes it all worthwhile!  We will now turn our attention to the objections.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\"><em class=\"_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE\"><strong class=\"_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU\">Objection 1.</strong></em></p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">The non-identity theodicy requires the truth of origin essentialism. This seems reasonably plausible on it's own. It seems like, at least partly, what would make me numerically distinct from an identical clone of myself would be my origins. Perhaps my clone was created in a test-tube using my DNA, whereas I was created through regular human reproduction etc. So my origins are an essential property of me, if those weren't my origins, I wouldn't be me. The problem is, the theodicy is more radical, it requires that the entire causal history prior to my coming-to-be, including facts about suffering that do not seem to have any relevant causal connection to my origins, are essential to me. This strikes me as unintuitive in the extreme. While an object like you are me, could not have a entirely different origin, it seems like we could have a slightly different origin. That is, it seems like some degree of modal tolerance is permissable. Suppose I didn't believe my great grandfather fought in the first world war, but then my father tells me he did. It doesn't seem, in the slightest, that I'm learning about who I am, that is, learning about my essential characteristics. Or that, if it later turned out my grandfather did not fight in WW1, I would be finding out that I'm a different person than I previously thought I was, that seems utterly bizarre. On the other hand, if I found out that I am a brain in a vat, or a clone created in a test-tube, it seems like I would indeed be shocked to find out that I am not who I thought I was! But then, if not every fact about our origins is essential, what facts are and aren't? On reflection, one answer with some plausibility, is the essential part of my origin is the event of my father's sperm fertilizing my mother's egg, and the set of pre-natal embryonic states which followed etc. That is, what is relevent to an object or persons origins, is the causal history of the material out of which it was originally constituted. What makes the desk on which I am typing, *this* desk, is the history of the wood and nails which constitutes it. A view such as this is often used in tandum with Kripke's causal theory of reference. For a technical paper on this see <a href=\"https://philpapers.org/rec/SALHNT\" class=\"_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">But suppose we even grant (as I would not) that every state of affairs which forms part of the causal chain ultimately leading to my birth, stretching back even to specific facts related to our evolutionary history, are an essential part of my origins as the argument needs. There is now a further question. Why then, couldn't the events which feature creaturely suffering, have radically different psychophysical connections? Were there a God, He could have easily set it up so that basically all the physical events in the causal chain leading up to my and your creation are the same as they are in this world, but the sensations of pain experienced internally by the creatures and persons were not horrifically agonizing, or at least greatly less so. So your origin and my origin is surely the same or same enough, our existence/essential properties would be preserved. Yet, the extremely undesirable experiences felt by persons and sentient non-persons leading up to us, would be greatly diminished. Surely God could have, indeed, would have, actualized that world, and as far as this theodicy goes, it appears to be left a mystery as to why He did not.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">The theodicist might conceivably respond, that actually if God were to change the psychophysical laws, He would have to change the physical events, since those phenomenal states, necessarily supervene on those physical states. But, for one this is highly implausible on the theists own view, since presumably God has phenomenal states prior to the creation of any physical states, and for those who maintain an afterlife, humans as well can have phenomenal states despite no longer having a physical body. So, it would seem phenomenal content does not necessarily depend on certain physical states, you can have different phenomenal contents despite changes in physical states. Further, it seems like, in principle, an omnipotent God should be understood as having complete control over the causal laws factive to His creation. Finally, even if a change in the specific phenomenal contents like pain, entails a change in physical states, it seems like only minor changes, utterly irrelevant to our material origins are required. The theist would need to motivate the prima facie implausible claim that changes relevant to our material origins are required, that isn't just an ad hoc move to save the theodicy.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Scott Hill has a <a href=\"https://kevinvallier.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hill_Non-Identity-Theodicy.pdf\" class=\"_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">paper</a> on the non-identity theodicy, where he attempts to motivate a radical origin essentialism. I will address this in turn.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Scott characterizes the origin essentialism he accepts as follows.</p><blockquote class=\"_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">\"Assembly Origin Essentialism: If the materials from which a creature originated were assembled by a process that was too different, then that creature would not have existed.\"</p></blockquote><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">At first blush, there doesn't seem to be an issue. But, it is left ambiguous what is precisely meant by \"too different\". Scott and I, are going to disagree on the threshold. Be that as it is, Scott gives 3 justifications for why an Assembly Origin Essentialism should be strong enough to motivate the non-identity theodicy.</p><blockquote class=\"_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">\"My first argument is that intervening in the world in the ways described in Waiting and Painless Evolution constitutes changes that are too big. At most a proponent of Assembly Origin Essentialism should allow a few minor changes to the process by which the materials  from which I arose are assembled such as the one in Forbes' example. On the other hand,  the miracles required in Waiting and Painless Evolution require big changes to the process. So my origin is not preserved in such cases.\"</p></blockquote><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">What Scott seems to be imagining here is God constantly making significant interventions, and performing miracles. This, however, is not a requirement. As discussed above, God does not have to make significant interventions, indeed, it doesn't seem like God has to intervene at all, He could have set it up so, prior to the initiation of the given causal chain, the events in the causal chain qua creaturely suffering, are linked up with less horrifically painful phenomenal states, or there are different psychophysical laws of nature. Otherwise, God could make small adjustments, so that the history of the materials leading to me, or you, are the same or similar enough, but there isn't such a frequency, intensity, and distribution, of horrific suffering among persons and non-persons. Afterall, it doesn't seem like a T-Rex mauling a Brochosaurus alive, or even my mother's pre-birth agony, is absolutely necessary for me, or Bob's, or anybody elses origins. The material out of which we originated could have an identical, or, intuitively, an identical enough history, such that I am still me and you are still you, sans such horrors. But even if we grant that God needs to make really major changes or interventions, it just needs to be logically actualizable that, in light of such major changes which are minimally sufficient to prevent horrific suffering, the history of our material origins could still be similar enough so that we would still exist. This seems logically possible, and since it seems logically possible, it seems like a state of affairs which God can actualize. So there are further burden-shifting grounds to reject Scott's claim.</p><blockquote class=\"_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">\"My second argument is that accepting such a strong variant of origin essentialism yields a gain in explanatory power... adopting a version of origin essentialism that rules out Waiting and Painless Evolution forms part of a theodicy that explains why God allows evil. That is a significant gain in explanatory power for the theist.\"</p></blockquote><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">I just have a couple points here. For one, it's debatable whether the non-identity theodicy does have such explanatory power, I've already offered a couple reasons to think it does not, and I will provide more reasons. For two, even if adopting such a view does explain the occurrence of evils under the truth of theism, as a non-theist, I do not grant that this is a gain in explanatory power tout court.</p><blockquote class=\"_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">\"My third argument is that adopting such a strong version of origin essentialism eliminates vagueness... There seems to be no principled way to say when an origin becomes so different that it fails to preserve the existence of an organism other than never or always. And if we are antecedently attracted to Assembly Origin Essentialism, it isn\u2019t plausible to hold that a change in origin never yields a different organism. So we should say that any change at all in the process by which the materials of my origin were assembled yields a different mere duplicate of me rather than me.\"</p></blockquote><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">This argument has more bite than the other two, but I think it is defeasible. I agree that if you hold that any change whatsoever in the causal history of ones origins is a change in the essential properties of some object or organism then that does indeed eliminate vagueness and arbitrariness, and, prima facie, this does seem to be a problem for views which are restrictive. But, so too would positing that having any strands of hair, constitutes non-baldness, or positing that any collection of 2 or more grains of sand constitutes a pile. We have an intuitive, conventional understanding of what a pile is, and what non-baldness is, and these views, while having the virtue of eliminating vagueness, simply do not track our concepts. This is analogous to radical origin essentialism, it simply doesn't track my, and I think our shared intuitive understanding of what makes us, us, and I take myself to have illustrated why this is so, above. If vagueness is a cost of maintaining such a view, then it's one I gladly pay, with the hopes that one day we do discover a restrictive criterion for essentiality of origins, which avoids issues of vague predicates.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\"><em class=\"_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE\"><strong class=\"_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU\">Objection 2.</strong></em></p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Suppose we forgo the first objection, and agree that a very radical kind of origin essentialism is true. Even so, I believe the plausibility of the theodicy is parasitic upon a subtle sort of equivocation. It rests on the intuition that the existence of you, and you in particular, your mother and father, your best friends and the love of your life, and those people in the actual world who satisfy those descriptions in particular are valuable in themselves, for their own sake. But suppose I asked you what makes them valuable, or at least, why you value them so dearly. Plausibly, you'd list out the set of things they've done for you, the bad times they were there to help you get through, the virtues and other admirable qualities they embody, possibly some physical features if you know what I mean. Among other things in that ballpark. It would be very odd for you to list off a specific set of essential properties related to their origins like that a great ape was eaten alive by an alligator billions of years ago. In fact, if you were to do that, I'd probably try to contact a mental health clinician. What this tells me is, while it can be granted that there are essential properties related to my origins that make me, me, rather than someone else. These essential features are, in fact, accidental if we zoom out and ask what stands in the right sort of making-relation in terms of my value properties. If God, in creating, was aiming towards some highly specific set of essential characteristics and in doing so actualizing states of affairs that are technically necessary to make us who we are, rather than the second order goods that plausibly make us valuable, then it seems like God's intentions are not contrastively, aimed at the right sort of end.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">A proponent of the theodicy might be tempted to argue, that actually, there is nothing further that makes me valuable, it is irreducible. I'm not valuable in virtue of exemplifying certain goods, I'm just valuable as such. Even this, however, won't do. If the value is irreducible, then God could have actualized such irreducible value properties without actualizing my origins. What's needed, is that there are irreducible value properties which somehow necessarily supervene on states of affairs related to my origins. So what makes me valuable, is my essential properties qua my origins. This again, just doesn't appear plausible on reflection and would need to be motivated.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">But even if it is motivated, there is of course an issue of whether the value of contrastively actualizing me, rather than a qualitatively identical counterpart with a different origin that doesn't involve as much horrific suffering, is so great that it outweighs the aforementioned horrific suffering which was permitted. This, of course, is even more implausible. Granted, Vince Vitale, and Scott Hill, for this reason seem to grant that this theodicy doesn't do the work on it's own, but rather only when supplemented with the fact that creaturely evils will be defeated in an afterlife. More on this later.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\"><em class=\"_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE\"><strong class=\"_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU\">Objection 3.</strong></em></p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">The last objection I will present will be an undercutting one, from Kantian (or other deontological) duties. The theodicy seems to be motivated by a kind of deontology, wherein God is permitting creaturely suffering for the sake of creating me, and you, whom are ends in themselves, in the Kantian sense. In actuality though, this theodicy is the furthest thing from an endorsement of Kantian ethics, and is in fact radically consequentialist. What God is doing, according to the non-identity theodicy, is permitting the agonizing suffering, death, violation of autonomy and destruction of faculties, of billions of rational agents, and non-rational sentient agents, as a mere means to a heteronomous end. That is, he treats rational agents as a mere means to bring about other rational agents with certain essential traits, He fails to treat rational agents as ends in themselves. No contemporary Kantian in the known universe would find such actions tolerable, and Kant himself would most likely be rolling in his grave. As a related point, even  the vast majority of consequentialists would find the kind of normative framework this theodicy requires implausible in the extreme. It's not like God is maximizing pleasure, or happiness, or any metric of utility consequentialists would find plausible, rather he permits horrors just to bring about specific persons with specific essential characteristics.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">In light of these objections, while this theodicy is an interesting and unique piece of philosophy, I cannot find it plausible, as even a partial justification of the evil we see.</p><div class=\"_7T4UafM1PdBGycd5na9nF\">The Participation Theodicy</div><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">The next theodicy I will be examining is one created by a catholic self-proclaimed twitter apologist <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WriterJohnBuck\" class=\"_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">John Buck</a>. Do not get the wrong impression though, he is not a pushover like his description implies and his participation theodicy is a clever one. Here is a <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hed5q797KsNwC453V1qpK663Qkk7k9oG/view\" class=\"_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">paper</a> he wrote on the theodicy, and here is a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/VjiseJXa2yQ\" class=\"_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">recent discussion</a> he had on it with an atheist Youtuber.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">To briefly summarize, atheists will often present the problem of evil by arguing that God would create a perfect, one might say heavenly world, and we are not in such a world. The participation theodicy starts by granting that the best thing God can do is actualize an ideal world. But, it would be better for God, to use Alvin Plantinga's jargon, not to strongly actualize such a world, that is actualize it with His own power, from the get-go. But to weakly actualize it, by allowing that free creatures participate in the actualization of an ideal world. The catch being, for free creatures to participate in the creation of the ideal world, the world must start out non-ideal, indeed it might start out in the very notably far from ideal situation we find ourselves, with great amounts of creaturely suffering. But God is justified in permitting such suffering, because it is an all-things-considered good that an ideal world is brought about, by virtue of the creative participation of free agents, rather than an act of God's will alone.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Before we start with objections a few things are worth noting regarding the theodicy. The first is that it avoids a lot of the pitfalls of most other responses to the problem of evil, such as moral paralysis, the existence of apparently gratuitous evils, explanations for natural evils or animal suffering,  why a better state of affairs was not actualized etc. It is not without issues, but it is I think a quite impressive feature that it is able to sidestep many of the traditional problems that other theodicies run afoul of. The next is that, the theodicy has a lot in common with free will theodicies. While, it's admittedly better than any free will theodicy I've encountered, and doesn't suffer from some of the same issues, I think it does inherit some of it's follies. The last is, while it doesn't suffer from many of the same issues of other theodicies, it does suffer from a common issue that I call the issue of counterbalancing evils. The participation theodicy requires the intuition that God letting creatures actualize an ideal world is a greater good than God actualizing it Himself from the get-go, this intuition is not widely held. But even if you do share the intuition, it's surely not so strong that God's contrastively actualizing the world where creatures participate in the creation of the ideal world rather than God Himself creating the ideal world, is enough to outweigh the horrors we see. This is especially clear when we reflect on particularly horrific evils like a baby's being born with butterfly disease to live a short earthly life of nothing but pure agony. The intuition pump John uses, to motivate the theodicy, wrt a husband allowing his children to participate in making the wifes breakfast (See his <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hed5q797KsNwC453V1qpK663Qkk7k9oG/view\" class=\"_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">paper</a> for more details) simply does not work for horrendous suffering. However, it may still be that the participation theodicy can be a partial justification and form part of a cumulative case against the problem of evil in conjunction with other partial justifications. My objections will attempt to undermine the participation theodicy as a partial justification.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\"><em class=\"_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE\"><strong class=\"_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU\">Objection 1.</strong></em></p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">The first objection I will present is I think probably the most common sense one, and one that Buck is familiar with. In order for the theodicy to be successful, it must be true, or at least plausible, that the actions of free creatures are tending toward the actualization of an ideal world. The problem being, this just doesn't seem to be plausible based on the evidence we have. In some ways, we have made substantive moral progress, technological progress, medical progress etc. but in many other ways things seem to be getting worse. Shootings in the US as of late are at an all-time high, global starvation is (almost) as bad as it's ever been, as is the horrors of factory farming and global predation, a certain party in the US is increasingly more deranged, we have the invasion of Ukraine, and the Isreali-Palestine conflict neither of which seem to be generally improving etc. We don't seem to be seeing a general trajectory towards an ideal state of affairs.</p><style class=\"mov-2-h\" data-href=\"chunkCSS/UsersCountIndicator.2ab8dda40f822a31d31c_.css\">._1W1pLIfaIb8rYU6YeTdAk6{margin-right:6px}._1H6Meh6ZAemKxOJDOEasfK{border-radius:50%;box-sizing:border-box;height:20px;margin-left:-8px;width:20px}._1H6Meh6ZAemKxOJDOEasfK:first-child{margin-left:0}._30vlMmCcnqKnXP1t-fzm0e{display:inline-block;margin-left:-8px;position:relative}\n._3wvjcIArtO7kKPJabZfZ9S{font-family:Noto Sans,Arial,sans-serif;font-size:12px;font-weight:400;line-height:16px;-ms-flex-align:center;align-items:center;color:var(--newCommunityTheme-metaText);display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;margin-right:24px;opacity:0;transition:opacity .1s ease-in-out}._3wvjcIArtO7kKPJabZfZ9S._1c98ixuh4QUWO9ERiFID3p{opacity:1}.RtAsN7UrR7u51W5kaOXvp{display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;margin-left:4px;margin-right:0}._1JRtpiobR4jYtbw-xx1tPO{border:1px solid var(--newRedditTheme-body);margin-left:-7px;transform:scaleX(-1)}._1JRtpiobR4jYtbw-xx1tPO:nth-child(2){margin-top:4px}\n\n/*# sourceMappingURL=https://www.redditstatic.com/desktop2x/chunkCSS/UsersCountIndicator.2ab8dda40f822a31d31c_.css.map*/</style><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Further, given our limitations, it doesn't seem likely at all, perhaps not even possible, that without any aid from God we could actualize an absolutely perfect world. Even if we do somehow manage to solve every single issue on the planet, and create a harmonious utopia where we live blissful lives, which is already unlikely in the extreme, it seems to me. There are plausibly goods that are beyond the capacities of creatures like us, which only God could access. So, without aid, we will always fall short of an ideal world.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Lastly, these are just issues on our tiny little spec of a planet, there is also, of course, the possibility of horrific suffering (or other related horrors we can imagine, such as disasters on a galactic scale) on other solar systems in the trillions upon trillions of Galaxies which exist in our universe (possibly multiverse). Additionally, there is an expectation of the heat death of the universe. Which means not only are we on a time limit to create an ideal world, but once we do participate in this theater of growth, learning, and ultimately creation of an ideal world, all biological creatures, and everything else in God's physical creation will be destroyed, so what gives? That is, unless of course God chimes in to prevent it. In which case, it's hard to see what the principled difference would be between God's intervention to prevent the natural death of all, and God's intervention to prevent horrific suffering.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Buck responds to this concern in his paper.</p><blockquote class=\"_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">\"The theodicy can grant that most creatures are incapable of significantly contributing towards the idealization of the world, but recall that the theodicy suggests we find ourselves in the midst of the process of idealization, not necessarily near its apex. For all we know there could be a billion more years before our world achieves idealization, well past the extinction of the human race. However, the very best things humans could be doing while we do exist would be to contribute what we can towards the eventual idealization of the world, even if that means simply doing what we can to prepare the next generation to be better at their responses to the hardships they will face.\"</p></blockquote><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">This response, however, is unsatisfying. Recall in the introduction that the job of a theodicy, unlike a defense, is to tell a story that is plausible in order to remove the evidential tension evil creates for theism, not merely true for-all-one knows. I am happy to grant that the story John wants to endorse, that if not humans, some superior species or other will causally contribute to an ideal world possibly billions of years from now, is true for all we know. But, antecedently, it seems to me this story is no more probable than a set of mutually exclusive, jointly exhaustive and equally intrinsically simple stories I can tell which fail to include the actualization of an ideal world. Such as that humans will be the last intelligent species to exist, or that there will be other species that exist but they will all fail utterly at creating an ideal world, or that instead of realization of an ideal world the actions of free agents will ultimately create a hell world (that is the worst world possible) etc. If John does not give a reason to think his story is antecedently more probable than a set of incompatible stories like these, that is importantly, independent from the truth of the theistic hypothesis. Then the probabilities balance each other out, and we are then left with our initial judgement that, all other things equal, we do not seem to be tending towards an ideal world.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\"><em class=\"_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE\"><strong class=\"_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU\">Objection 2.</strong></em></p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">As I said previously, this theodicy, I think runs afoul of some of the same issues as the free will defense. This theodicy relies on a distinction between God actualizing an ideal world, and free creatures being placed in a set of circumstances and participating in the actualizing of an ideal world. In other words, a distinction between God's strong actualization of an ideal world, and weak actualization of an ideal world. I think there are reasons to think the distinction collapses in this case, however.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Following the late and brilliant atheist philosopher <a href=\"https://www.amazon.ca/Miracle-Theism-Arguments-against-Existence/dp/019824682X\" class=\"_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">J.L. Mackie</a>. It would seem omniscience in conjunction with omnipotence jointly entails, or at least strongly implies, omnifiscence. That is, God is responsible for the strong actualization of every event, including the actions of His created free creatures. Here is an argument for that.</p><ol class=\"_1eJr7K139jnMstd4HajqYP\"><li class=\"_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">If God is omnipotent, then all events are maximally within His power.</p></li><li class=\"_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">If God is omniscient, then all events are maximally within His awareness.</p></li><li class=\"_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">If all events are maximally within God's awareness and power, then God is maximally responsible for all events.</p></li><li class=\"_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Therefore God is maximally responsible for all events.</p></li></ol><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">The intuition here is that, the common-sense distinction between doing something, and allowing something to happen does not hold for a being of unlimited power, and unlimited knowledge. Mackie argues that this everyday distinction is motivated by two considerations</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">A) If we bring something about, there is effort we exert, but if we allow something to happen there is not. The less effort we must exert to prevent the given state of affairs, the more responsible we are.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">B) Letting something happen is often associated with some degree of inadvertedness, while bringing something about requires great attentiveness. The more attentive one is, the greater their responsibility is.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">But A, and B become inapplicable as power and knowledge increases without limit. It would seem that for a being with unlimited power and unlimited vision, this distinction would not hold at all. So a being that is omniscient and omnipotent does everything. Note this does not mean that free creatures do nothing, but as Mackie I think cogently argues, God is in complete control of people's free choices.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Once we realize the distinction between God actualizing an ideal world, and allowing creatures to participate in the actualization of an ideal world collapses due to God's omnifiscence, Buck is once again open to the question; Why did God not actualize an ideal world from the get-go? If not, at the very least, why did God permit all this horrific suffering? It cannot be because God wanted to allow His creatures to participate in the creation of an ideal world, because if the above argument is right, then all the same, their participation just is His participation.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Even if Mackie's argument is unsound, nonetheless I think we have good reason to think the distiction the theodicy rests on does not do the work Buck requires. We can ask the obvious question, even if free creatures participating in the creation of an ideal world is all-things-considered better than the world where God alone participates. Why then, did God not actualize the world where free creatures never make decisions which hinder the creation of an ideal world, free creatures who always freely choose to do good and who's actions are always directed at the creation of an ideal world, never comitting horrific moral evils. Prima facie, that state of affairs seems to be better than the state of affairs where free creatures often do evil, which we find in the actual world. How could Buck respond? Well, plausibly, if God did that, then His creatures wouldn't truly be free, and they would not truly be participating in the creation of an ideal world without the aid of God. But this would be to remove intrinsic goods that would otherwise exist.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">This won't do though for a few reasons. First, consider that it seems God could actualize the truth-conditions for counterfactuals of creaturely freedom. A counterfactual of creaturely freedom would be a conditional statement like the following;</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">C*) \"If S were to obtain, Smith would do A\"</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Where S represents all relevant states of affairs prior to Smith's choice, and A is, for our purposes, a freely chosen action that has the property of being morally right. It seems God could actualize such truth-makers where free creatures, in the circumstances God actualizes, always do good, and always contribute to the creation of the ideal world. Why might it be the case that God cannot make such counterfactuals true? Afterall, such counterfactuals are contingent truths, and God is omnipotent. Buck might argue that if God, prior to creation, actualizes the truth-conditions of such counterfactuals, then agents would not truly be free, and God would simply be causing agents to do the right thing. This, it seems to me, is not right. For one, God making C* true would not entail that there is a necessitating causal relation between the antecedent and the consequent of the conditional. Yes, God would cause the proposition C* to be true, but this does not entail that the action included in C* is itself causally determined, it can still be freely chosen. For two, even if God did not actualize the truth-conditions for C*, it would still seem that C* or some other mutually exclusive counterfactual would be true even if by happenstance, and so God by actualizing S or any set of circumstances that would constitute the antecedent of the given counterfactual, would nonetheless make it true that Smith does A or A* (whatever actions those specify).</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Another reason this won't seem to do, is that it seems, by the theists own lights, God is an essentially morally perfect entity and yet always does the right action. So, it's on the participation theodicist to show that God could not actualize beings who, like Him, are both essentially morally perfect and completely free, in which case God could have actualize a world, where there are none but perfect creatures like Him participating in the actualization of an ideal world.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Finally, it seems like the nature created beings are endowed with, explain why creatures make the choices they do. Since no creature is responsible for their nature, not even God (This is easily proved, if God were to choose to have a perfectly good nature, then God would first have to have such a nature that is motivated to make such a choice. Thus God's nature is logically prior to His choices) then that creatures are, beforehand, actualized with the right sort of natures does not at all take away their responsibility for their actions. So, it's unclear why God could not actualize creatures with natures that are morally perfect, or at least far less disposed towards moral evils in the process of contributing to the ideal world.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\"><em class=\"_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE\"><strong class=\"_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU\">Objection 3.</strong></em></p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">The final objection I will present, is that, even if Buck is able to successfully answer the first two objections, the participation theodicy is still, I believe, impotent against the best formulations of the problem of evil which is inference to the best explanation/Bayesian arguments. The one I will be focusing on here, will be Draper's <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2215486\" class=\"_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">infamous argument</a> from pain and pleasure. The basic argument goes as follows;</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">On naturalism, given our background information of evolution by natural selection and that organisms are goal-directed biological systems. Antecedently, what we'd expect is that, generally all functional traits of organisms including pleasure and pain, contribute to the biological goals of reproduction or survival, and the times they don't is explained by the imperfect tuning of our biological processes (E.g burning to death doesn't need to be that painful for the biological goals of an organism to be satisfied). On theism, the inference from the background information of natural selection, to pleasure and pain serving biological functions is undercut, since it needs to also be true that God's desires, or moral reasons, happen to align with pleasure and pain happening to align with the biological goals of survival and reproductive success. Antecedently, we have some reason to expect God to treat pleasure and pain differently then other functional properties, since pleasure and pain have moral value, and God being morally perfect, ceteris paribus would be expected to have compassion for His creatures and not permit their horrific suffering unless He has a morally justifying reason to do so. The theist can tell an auxiliary story to explain why, on theism God permits horrific pain and allows that pleasure and pain happen to serve biological functions, but of course this story will inevitably be much less virtuous then the naturalists, more straightforward explanation.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">The participation theodicy is utterly powerless against this argument because it only explains general facts, such as why we are not in an ideal world, why there are horrific instances of suffering. It gives us no reason to antecedently expect specific facts about pain and pleasure being tied to the goals of organisms etc. While it can explain the general fact of why there is horrific evils, it provides no explanation for such specific facts. Thus, it fails to address Draper's argument.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Interestingly, Buck, in his <a href=\"https://youtu.be/VjiseJXa2yQ?t=4417\" class=\"_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">conversation</a> with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@EmersonGreen\" class=\"_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">Emerson Green</a>, responds to the argument. I'm low on space so I'll just address a couple of his responses. He argues the theodicy will grant that pain and pleasure being morally correlated would be an ideal world, but on the theodicy we will start out with a non-ideal world, so it's fine that we start out with pain and pleasure being biologically and non-morally correlated. Granted, on the theodicy it could be that we start out with a world where pains and pleasures happen to serve biological rather than moral roles, but this gives us no antecedent reason whatsoever to expect such a specific link between pain and pleasure and these biological functions, God could have actualized a world where pain and pleasure are linked to infinitely other physical states or functions, why is it that God's desires/moral reasons happen to align with the precise psychophysical connections we see? On naturalism, we do have such an antecedent reason. He then argues that because epiphenomenalism is consistent with naturalism and evolution, this undercuts the inference we would be able to make on naturalism and evolution that pain and pleasure will have these correlations. I think this both misunderstands the argument, and epiphenomenalism.  The argument holds, not that it is necessary that pain and pleasure will have such functions, but that we can inductively reason from our background information that, since all these other functions (including phenomenal properties) are correlated with biological goals, we would expect pain and pleasure to work the same way. Epiphenomenalism holds that mental states themselves do not have causal powers, not that they cannot causally supervene on physical properties, all our evidence suggests that they do so causally supervene.</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  \"  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  \"  >  A     C  r  i  t  i  c  a  l     R  e  f  l  e  c  t  i  o  n     o  n     s  o  m  e     I  n  t  e  r  e  s  t  i  n  g     T  h  e  o  d  i  c  i  e  s  <  /  h  1  >"},

Christianity, as defined by its scriptures, claims that its scriptures were written by YHWH and are suitable guidance for Christians (2 Timothy 3:16). Christians refer to their scriptures as \"the word of god\" and similar terms. If the Christians' scriptures were truly written by YHWH and Christians were guided by YHWH, then they would be easily able to distinguish YHWH's scriptures from lesser writings. After all, YHWH, according to the Christians' scriptures, cannot lie (Titus 1:2, Hebrews 6:18). But Christians cannot agree about what constitutes their scriptures, which in turn suggests that YHWH's alleged wisdom and writing cannot easily be distinguished from human writings - in turn undermining the justification for trusting the Christians' scriptures as special and worthy of trust by Christians because they were written by YHWH.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">The Roman Catholics add to the scriptures used by Protestants the following texts: Tobit, Judith, portions of Esther, 1 Maccabees, 2 Maccabees, Wisdom of Solomon, Ecclesiasticus (also known as Sirach), Baruch, Letter of Jeremiah, The Prayer of Azariah and Song of the Three Holy Children to the Book of Daniel, the story of Susanna to the Book of Daniel, and the story of Bel and the Dragon to the Book of Daniel.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">The Eastern Orthodox churches have added the following texts in addition to what the Roman Catholics have added: 3 Maccabees, 4 Maccabees (Georgian church only), 1 Esdras, 2 Esdras (Georgian church only), Odes, Psalm 151, Psalms 152-155 (Syriac Peshitta only), Baruch 2 (Syriac Peshitta only), and the Prayer of Manasseh.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">The Ethiopian Orthodox add the following texts in addition to the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Texts: Books of Enoch, Book of Jubilees, Rest of the Words of Baruch (aka Paralipomena of Baruch), 1 Meqabyan, 2 Meqabyan, 3 Meqabyan.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">And in the past, Christians have had even stranger conflicts about which texts should be regarded as scripture. For example, a text claiming to be Paul's Epistle to the Laodiceans was included in some early Latin texts of the New Testament, and was cited by Pope Gregory the Great and included in John Wycliffe's translation, but Jerome and many others believed it to be a forgery - which modern Christianity agrees with even as it agrees about little else. Yet a Pope thought otherwise!</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">The Christian, noting my flair, may assert that Buddhism is no better with its Mahayana and Tantric scriptures, to say nothing of its treasure texts - which are and have been condemned by Buddhists from various sects as forgeries. But such a claim would not address my argument in this post.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Edited in order to add: My argument in this thread is not about when texts were added or removed, but rather about how different Christian denominations have different scriptures. I used the Protestant Christian scriptures and the concept of other denominations adding to their scriptures not because I was claiming that other sects literally added to Protestant scriptures but in order to more effectively convey how Protestant Christian Scriptures, far from being universally accepted among Christians as complete, are a base to which other Christian sects have added texts.</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  \"  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  \"  >  T  h  e     f  a  c  t     t  h  a  t     C  h  r  i  s  t  i  a  n  s     c  o  u  l  d     n  o  t     a  n  d     c  a  n  n  o  t     a  g  r  e  e     a  b  o  u  t     w  h  a  t     w  o  r  k  s     b  e  l  o  n  g     w  i  t  h  i  n     t  h  e  i  r     s  c  r  i  p  t  u  r  e  s     i  s     d  e  v  a  s  t  a  t  i  n  g     t  o     c  l  a  i  m  s     f  o  r     C  h  r  i  s  t  i  a  n     a  u  t  h  o  r  i  t  y  .  <  /  h  1  >"},

Where did we come from?</strong></p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Where did we come from? First, let\u2019s admit that nobody knows. How do we come to know anything? Oftentimes, it\u2019s by reasoning about observations. So, let\u2019s start with one of the simplest observations. It appears that there is something rather than nothing. Planets, trees, paperclips, and we ourselves appear to be here. Most of us agree with this observation, and if we didn\u2019t, there\u2019d be nothing to explain, so for sake of conversation, let\u2019s assume for now that we do in fact exist.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Supposing stuff does exist, it seems reasonable to ask how it got here - where did it come from? The fact that we think an explanation is needed here implies that we all share a certain idea of what counts as a good explanation. Oil and vinegar is a good explanation for salad dressing; eating soap is a good explanation for getting sick; and the idea that the world is round is a good explanation for how a traveler moving in any straight line will eventually arrive where she started.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">But it\u2019s easy to imagine how things could have been different. Salad dressing could have been made from other ingredients; the kid who ate soap might have already been sick from a stomach flu; and the world could have been more ovular in shape. So the fact that we think explanations are needed implies that certain things do demand explanation. And the fact that some explanations are better than others implies that we all have certain standards for what counts as a good explanation.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Let\u2019s explore some possible explanations for all this stuff in our world. First, it could be that it all came from nothing. But this seems like a pretty unsatisfying explanation because it doesn\u2019t actually explain anything. How exactly could something come from nothing? In ordinary life, we have no single example of anything ever having come from nothing, and if it did, we\u2019d have no natural explanation for how it did that, or how we could make it happen again. Even on the quantum scale, where photons appear to come from nowhere, we have no current explanation for how this happens. If we conclude that it happens as the result of supernatural forces, we haven\u2019t explained anything. We\u2019ve just put a label on a mystery. But just because we don\u2019t know the explanation doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t be explained one day according to natural laws. There are innumerable examples in history of solving mysteries in this way.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">If we were to conclude that something came from nothing, then our definition of nothing must be wrong because if something came from it, then it wasn\u2019t really nothing to begin with. That\u2019s just true by definition. Since, to our best knowledge, something can\u2019t literally come from absolutely nothing, maybe the stuff of this world has always only ever come from other stuff. Something can surely come from something else. Of course, this explanation might not be immediately satisfying because it implies an infinite regress of causes - a cosmic passing of the buck. We have an intuition that there must be a first cause - the original stuff. The problem is that if there is a first cause, we\u2019re right back at square one, looking for an explanation for that stuff.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">It\u2019s in situations like these that we should reflect on our assumptions and whether they could be wrong. For one, maybe there are mysteries that our minds can\u2019t solve. Maybe the world is here because of supernatural forces, and maybe we can call that God, and we\u2019ll take it on faith that God is the first cause. Ok, but if we think this, we\u2019ve drastically lowered our bar for what counts as a good explanation. By lowering the bar to that degree, we\u2019re forced to contend with innumerable other explanations for existence, like that the universe was born from Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, or the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Spaghetti_Monster\" class=\"_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">flying spaghetti monster</a>, or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Turtle\" class=\"_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">on the back of a turtle</a>, as some religions teach. Taking things on faith unfortunately opens us up to believe all kinds of fictions and falsehoods, making it impossible to tell truth from fiction. This is fine only if you think the search for truth is completely meaningless.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">So, if we stand by the premise that something can\u2019t ultimately come from nothing, then maybe there\u2019s a flaw in our assumption that there must be a first cause. If something always comes from something else, why does that strike us as a bad explanation? I suspect the answer has to do with the great difficulty human minds have trying to understand the meaning of the concepts \u201cnothing\u201d and \u201cthe infinite\u201d. All along we\u2019ve been assuming that \u201cnothing\u201d means there is objectively nothing present, and \u201cinfinity\u201d refers to something that is objectively endless. We think of them as polar opposites. But how can we be sure these characterizations are true? No scientist has ever successfully observed absolute nothingness or absolute infinity. In fact, scientists who have attempted to take measurements of \u201cnothing\u201d (that is, a vacuum) have found quite the opposite of nothing: their measurements reveal that <a href=\"https://www.insidescience.org/news/study-about-nothing\" class=\"_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">vacuums have energetic states</a>. So \u201cnothing\u201d and \u201cinfinity\u201d have something interesting in common. When we try to describe them at the elemental level, we can describe them both as energetic states. \u201cNothing\u201d and \u201cinfinity\u201d are also both believed to be homogenous states, meaning that each one can be understood in some sense as uniform. There\u2019s an adage that fish will be the last to discover water. This is an apt analogy here because it shows how one and the same substance can be perceived as both vast and absent, depending on one\u2019s point of view. Fish might not notice water because it uniformly permeates everything in their world, much like humans once believed that the air in our atmosphere is empty space; to a bird, of course, there is nothing empty about air.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">In daily life, we think of \u201cnothing\u201d in an absolute sense because it appears to be empty, static, and uniform relative to our lived experience. But to mistake this state for truly nothing in an absolute sense just reveals our own bias - much like we conceive of the earth as being motionless. From a broader perspective, it can only be described as motionless relative to us.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">This relational property of the universe means that nothing and infinity might not be polar opposites. Imagine a person who believes that the earth is flat and can\u2019t conceive of it being any other way. If this person were to travel in a perfectly straight line, say, Eastward, along the equator, eventually they would return to their origin point. The flat earther would be astonished. In their mind, East and West are polar opposites. So, they might think they had traveled through a wormhole hole. Of course, we know that East and West are not strict opposites, and the traveler\u2019s reappearing act can be easily explained by assuming the earth is spherical. But to achieve that understanding, we had to think in three dimensions instead of two. Likewise, the seemingly mysterious properties of \u201cnothingness\u201d and \u201cinfinity\u201d could be an indication that they are not the polar opposites that they appear to be in our three-dimensional perspective, but are closely related properties of a higher-dimensional phenomenon.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">The lesson here is that \u201cnothing\u201d and \u201cinfinity\u201d could conceivably be, not absolute states, but relational states, two manifestations of a single fundamental entity. If emptiness and infinity are ultimately manifestations of the same thing, then it\u2019s meaningless to ask what caused stuff to come into being because, at the most fundamental level that we can comprehend, something has always been there. It\u2019s the changes in that cosmic stuff, the temporary perturbations that, like waves on the ocean\u2019s surface, form the relational states that we know as life.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">It\u2019s a bewildering thought. And I'm the first to admit that I have no idea what lies beyond our three-dimensional existence. But should our bewilderment serve as evidence that the universe must have been created by God? I don\u2019t think so because, as discussed above, attributing creation to God is no more explanatory than attributing it to a spaghetti monster, and more importantly, because there might be no first cause as we understand it. So whether God exists or not, the explanation for our universe remains mysterious, at least for the foreseeable future. In the meantime, we have a choice: we can take that mystery on faith, or we can study it, measure it, test it, challenge and revise our own assumptions until we achieve, however slightly, a richer understanding of this amazing world we live in.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\"><strong class=\"_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU\">Part 2. How should we behave?</strong></p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Holding aside questions about the nature of the universe, there remains a more practical question. If God doesn\u2019t exist,  how can we all get along? How would we agree on what is good? To whom would we hold ourselves accountable?</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">These are difficult questions, and I won\u2019t pretend to have all the right answers. But there\u2019s reason to believe that it\u2019s not a lost cause. Denying the belief in God does not necessitate a world of chaos, selfishness, violence, and debauchery. The challenge is this: to develop systems of cooperation that sustain themselves on the basis of rules that are likely to be honored by individuals with competing interests. One way to approach this challenge is to study, scientifically, what sorts of systems of cooperation work better than others.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">But first, why should we cooperate in the first place? If God doesn\u2019t exist, what would motivate us to play nice? One motivation could be that it feels good to be nice. But that\u2019s a hard sell because sometimes it also feels good to be selfish, so this makes it hard to know when to follow which motivation. Another motivation could be that it\u2019s ultimately in our best interest to make sacrifices now for greater gains later. For example, forgoing a paycheck now to finish a high-school education could help a graduate cultivate the skills and resources they need to earn a larger paycheck later and serve both themselves and their community in a more effective way. Giving up drinking now could help someone be a better parent, which in turn will tend to help to raise a healthier, more virtuous child, and thus a healthier future relationship that benefits both parties much more than the instant gratification that alcohol could bring. But for such a motivation to be adopted, people really need to believe it, and to really believe it, it needs to usually prove itself true. So a good system of rules is one that delivers on its promises.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Many religious traditions would claim to meet this definition. They are systems of rules that purport that good things will come to those who follow their rules. This is essentially what the Golden Rule is all about, which is foundational to so many religions and non-religious traditions. But does the Golden Rule always deliver on its promises? Of course not. It\u2019s just a rule of thumb. So how do we get people to follow the rule when it doesn\u2019t deliver? Many religions try to do that through faith; Others through authority; Others through ritual. Many of these great efforts to get people to follow the rules have won the hearts of particular individuals. But none of them have won the hearts of all mankind. I think this is because, for some people to be adequately motivated, they require stronger evidence that the rules will tend to deliver on their promises. For many people, that means discovering a set of rules that generate payoffs in this lifetime.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">So, how can we discover such a set of rules? The scientific method suggests that we should be able to discover such rules through the systematic observation of our own world\u2014that\u2019s the only place we can observe after all. One starting point might be to observe the people for whom the rules are clearly not working: the downtrodden, who have labored hard each day simply for a roof over their head and a meal in their belly, and still have nothing to show for it. The sinners, who abuse others for personal gratification. Maybe instead of promising them reward or punishment in the afterlife and expecting them to take it on faith, it behooves us to help them identify the future payoffs of good behavior in this life. To do that, we need to study what\u2019s failing them. Is it a systemic, economic problem, like the lack of mechanisms for upward mobility? Is it the lack of mental health resources necessary to persist in the face of these obstacles? A combination? There may be hundreds, or thousands, of barriers to thriving, and the prevalence of these societal problems is evidence that much more work is needed to be done to identify the changes to the rulebook that are needed to promote thriving. Instead of expecting the faithless to take it on faith, we could try to find a way to give them something they have reason to believe in. So, what should motivate us to play nice without God? A constructed system of rules that can consistently prove its own worth to ordinary people.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Even if there are good reasons to play nice without God, how can we go about doing it? If one person thinks it\u2019s good to steal and another does not, how can we decide who\u2019s right without appealing to a higher authority? Again, this is a hard question, and we don\u2019t have all the answers yet. But a partial answer is that stealing is wrong to the extent that we can consistently demonstrate situations in which individuals who forgo stealing from one another both do better in the long run. What counts as \u201cdoing better\u201d is largely self-evident and already agreed on by theists and non-theists alike, like having consistent access to food, shelter, social support, etc.. In this framework, studying the social rules and mechanisms that best facilitate such outcomes is a rational act of service.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">If we don\u2019t know whether God exists, wouldn\u2019t it be more rational to assume he does exist and be wrong than to assume he does not exist and be wrong? In this view, if he does exist, the faithless will suffer eternal damnation, whereas if he doesn\u2019t, the faithful will have forgone only some minor inconveniences in this life. This idea is known as Pascal\u2019s Wager, named after the 17th-Century French theologian who made a rational argument for believing in God. It would be a compelling argument if we had absolute uncertainty about whether God exists or not. If we had absolutely no idea either way\u2014that is, if our odds of being wrong were 50/50\u2014then eternal damnation surely does seem the one to avoid. But here\u2019s the catch: our uncertainty about God\u2019s existence is not 50/50. We have vast libraries of scientific knowledge about how matter behaves and the rules of what can cause what. So far, virtually all of it has been explained without positing the existence of God - all except for the first cause - but as we discussed above, positing that God exists does not actually help to explain that. So given that the existence of God defies probability, it turns out that believing he does not exist is not a very big risk after all. Consider driving a car. Driving has inherent risks. The cost of getting in a serious car accident while driving to the grocery store on a given day is certainly worse than the cost of not driving to the store that day. And if the odds of getting into an accident were 50/50, it would indeed be rational to stay home and order your groceries online, even if that\u2019s more expensive in the short term. But the odds of getting into a car accident on a given day are not 50/50, and we know this from hard data. The risk is not zero, but it\u2019s small enough that we could justifiably conclude that driving to the grocery store is worth the risk. The same is true for the belief in God. Does this rational case for denying the existence of God mean we should abandon all social rules governing human behavior? Only if you have no other reason for being good. But as we have discussed, we have other good reasons for being good.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Most of us are seekers of truth, but we vary in our standards of proof for deciding what\u2019s true. Those who adopt a scientific perspective are not ready to give up on natural explanations because, over the long term, their approach has an unsurpassed track record. This is because they commit themselves to an extremely high standard of proof. Their approach is not a quick fix - it\u2019s a slow and laborious process. But even if they fail to answer the biggest questions in the end, their efforts will not be in vain because their journey can only bring us closer. Anyone who cares about truth should find comfort in this.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Postscript: I'm happy to concede that I could be wrong about all of this. If, one day, God appears to me to invalidate my views, I'm willing to stand corrected. That\u2019s the beauty of the scientific perspective - it\u2019s amenable to revision and improvement. But he'd have his work cut out for him because, to persuade a scientist of an extraordinary claim, one must have extraordinary evidence. Mere voices and miracles are not enough since those can likely be explained as hallucinations or illusions. Instead, God would have to prove his existence to us using scientific standards or else prove why our standards are wrong. Since the only way to verify the truth of a proposition is through a combination of observation and reason, then I have to expect God, like any meaningful phenomenon, to be observable and reasonable, and if he is not, I cannot be expected to find truth in God. So I have no worries about eternal damnation. If God is the all-good, all-knowing, all-powerful figure some think he is, then when my time of reckoning comes, he will not damn me for this stance on life. If anything, he may reward me for it because defending a high standard of truth in a world full of doubt is a greater act of service than mere faith alone. If he meets these high standards or proves to me why they are wrong, only then will I believe in him. That\u2019s a risk I\u2019m willing to take.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">I don't expect all readers to agree with me about all this. And I still think individuals can lead a good life without enlisting in the scientific worldview. Not everyone needs to be guided by that view, just like not everyone needs to be a plumber. But it's a good thing that we have plumbers. And for those of us who are not, it behooves us to learn a thing or two about how a toilet works. After all, it could save our ass someday.</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  \"  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  \"  >  T  h  e     u  n  i  v  e  r  s  e     i  s     a     c  l  o  g  g  e  d     t  o  i  l  e  t  ,     s  c  i  e  n  c  e     i  s     t  h  e     p  l  u  m  b  e  r  ,     a  n  d     G  o  d     i  s     M  I  A  .  <  /  h  1  >"},

If objective morality did not exist we would not be able to state exactly what is good and what is bad with 100% certainty. Good and evil would ultimately be based on opinion. So what? Neither of those statements prove anything. They prove that for some people it may be more comfortable to believe in objective morality, but neither statement proves that there must be an objective morality. It might be scarier to live in a world where morality is based on opinion and no moral prescription is set in stone, but tough luck, that's the world we live in.

Therefore it makes sense that we shouldn't get cavities. However, defaulting to the most simple or most comfortable mode of thinking may cause us to miss important details and come to the wrong conclusion. It may be more comfortable and intuitive to believe the world is flat. However, the fact that it is comfortable and intuitive does not prove that it is the case.</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  \"  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  \"  >  E  v  e  n     i  f     o  b  j  e  c  t  i  v  e     m  o  r  a  l  i  t  y     i  s     c  o  m  f  o  r  t  i  n  g     t  o     b  e  l  i  e  v  e     i  n     a  n  d     f  e  e  l  s     i  n  t  u  i  t  i  v  e  ,     n  e  i  t  h  e  r     o  r     t  h  o  s  e     t  h  i  n  g  s     m  a  k  e     i  t     a  n  y     m  o  r  e     l  i  k  e  l  y     t  o     e  x  i  s  t     t  h  a  n     s  u  b  j  e  c  t  i  v  e     m  o  r  a  l  i  t  y  .  <  /  h  1  >"},

Insisting that you've defined your god as being able to start the universe is in absolutely no way evidence that your god started the universe. No more so than my keys not being here \"proves\" they were taken by key gnomes. The reason theists don't agree with this is part of being a theist is adopting one set of logic that you use for most everything and a second set of bad logical rules, excuses, and exceptions that are only employed for a theist's chosen religion. This is why, for example, modern day Christians would laugh at the idea of Thor being responsible for thunder (or any non-Christian religious claim) yet insist that Yahweh is the exception for which this bad logic \"works\". It doesn't.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">So when people talk about the Kalam cosmological argument, first causes, etc., they are talking about fictional things who exist purely in the realm of fairy tales (like Voldemort or Pokemon creatures).

It's just another claim that requires evidence.</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  \"  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  \"  >  A  n     i  m  a  g  i  n  a  r  y     c  r  e  a  t  u  r  e  ,     e  v  e  n     o  n  e     w  h  o  s  e     t  r  a  i  t  s     s  o  l  v  e     s  o  m  e     u  n  k  n  o  w  n     i  n     t  h  e     r  e  a  l     w  o  r  l  d  ,     i  s     s  t  i  l  l     p  u  r  e  l  y     f  i  c  t  i  o  n  a  l     &  a  m  p  ;     i  m  a  g  i  n  a  r  y     w  i  t  h  o  u  t     e  v  i  d  e  n  c  e  <  /  h  1  >"},

(This also applies to Abrahamic religion in general, and most worldwide religions)</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Tribalism is a prominent reason why what the Bible regards as \"evil\" and \"bad\" is simply just nonsensical defamation of the human being. As humans, we collaborate and cooperate, but also challenge each other and compete against one another. There is nothing in the entirety of human history dating back to the origin of human existence that suggests we were ever anything different, or that we are destined to become one with an external, supernatural being that has the ability to collect our souls and transfer us into another realm entirely, on the condition that we pledged our utmost unquestioning and unadulterated obedience and submission to that supreme entity.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">The reality of human nature is slandered by the Bible and Christianity itself as a way to exercise control and power over the common population, where critical thinking was underdeveloped, education was scarce, and superstition and ignorance was at the forefront of the majority of people in Biblical times, especially regarding the history and culture of the stories depicted.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Lying, stealing, cheating, hating, murdering (and don't forget mass fucking and orgies) ... other animals, namely mammals (which human beings would be categorized as if we were put in the same box under the same labels as the animal kingdom) are capable of doing all of those things, and there is no evidence to suggest otherwise.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Animals are also capable of altruism, self-sacrifice and teamwork, something which humans would highly regard and value as \"honorable\" and \"noble\". What a human being would consider as having \"integrity\" and \"honesty\", is really just in the grand scheme of things a survival mechanism.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Human beings work better together, than against each other, and that's that. There is also no proof nor evidence to suggest that the god depicted in the Abrahamic religions, namely Christianity, is anything more than an abstract concept formulated as an extension of mankind that showcases their narcissism, entitlement and desire to exercise power and control with others. The idea that Christianity is somehow different and is a \"relationship with God\" instead of just any mere religion is also just mere delusion and a coping mechanism that assists believers with getting through life.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">TL;DR - Human beings are painted as terrible beings in the Bible and Christianity even though it makes no sense to put them down as such because they are no different than the other living beings on the planet.</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  \"  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  \"  >  T  h  e     r  e  a  l  i  t  y     o  f     h  u  m  a  n     n  a  t  u  r  e     i  s     s  l  a  n  d  e  r  e  d     b  y     C  h  r  i  s  t  i  a  n  i  t  y     a  n  d     t  h  e     B  i  b  l  e     i  t  s  e  l  f  <  /  h  1  >"},

Titus 1:2 and Hebrews 6:18 assert that YHWH cannot lie. Romans 3:4 encourages Christians to regard YHWH's words as true even if all people must be regarded as liars.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Stringing these claims into a coherent picture, we get the following claim easily enough: because the Christians' scriptures were written by an always truthful entity, Christians should believe the Christians' scriptures rather than any human claims which contradict the Christians' scriptures.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Nor should this be regarded as an empty hypothetical. Christians exist who are willing to be guided by their scriptures in rejecting, among other things, evolution, deep time, the world's sphericity, and even the germ theory of disease, the role of mental health services in dealing with mental illness, and the role of medicine in treating disease. The Westboro Baptists have even accepted as true the controversial doctrine that YHWH causes bad things in the world (which is supported by the Christians' scriptures, as I have shown), rejecting claims by Christian theologians that YHWH does not cause bad things in the world.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Therefore, Christians should not be surprised when non-Christians expect Christians' beliefs to be guided by the Christians' scriptures rather than by contrary opinions.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Any Christian who accuses my argument of taking verses out of context indirectly condemns the Christians' scriptures.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">This is because the Christian scriptures include Christian interpretation of the Hebrew Scriptures, in which authors in the Christian scriptures will take single phrases or verses completely out of context in order to claim, falsely, that they support Christian theology. For example, GMatthew 2:14-15 explicitly cites Hosea's statement about YHWH's calling his son out of Egypt as evidence that Jesus's trip to and from Egypt was in fulfilment of a prophecy - completely ignoring that in the context of Hosea's writings, the son called from Egypt is clearly a personified Israel, with the journey from Egypt's being already fulfilled in Hosea's time by the Exodus (Hosea 11:1).</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Similarly, GMatthew 2:16-18 presents Herod's actions against infants as a fulfilment of Jeremiah 31:15. But Jeremiah 31:15 is part of a longer prophecy about the Jews' return from exile (Jeremiah 31, especially 31:15-17) that the Bible presents as having been fulfilled by Cyrus, not a prophecy about a future massacre of children.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">As a final example, consider Paul's claim in Romans 3:12 that \"there is none that doeth good, no, not one\" as part of his argument about how we all need YHWH's salvation through Jesus. Paul says in Romans 3:10, however, that he is quoting what is written, presumably within the Hebrew Scriptures. Psalms 14 and 53 both contain (at 14:3 and 53:3) the phrase \"there is none that doeth good, no, not one\". However, since Psalms 14 and 53 both open (at 14:1 and 53:1) with condemnation of all atheists as corrupt and wicked fools, it is easy to understand Psalms 14 and 53 (at 14:3 and 53:3), with their phrase \"there is none that doeth good, no, not one\", as condemning atheists rather than all people. Certainly, this narrower view is supported by GJohn 5:29, 2 Corinthians 5:10, and 3 John 11, all of which talk about people doing good.</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  \"  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  \"  >  B  e  c  a  u  s  e     o  f     w  h  a  t     t  h  e     C  h  r  i  s  t  i  a  n  s  '     s  c  r  i  p  t  u  r  e  s     s  a  y     a  b  o  u  t     t  h  e  m  s  e  l  v  e  s     a  n  d     t  h  e  i  r     a  u  t  h  o  r  ,     C  h  r  i  s  t  i  a  n  s     s  h  o  u  l  d     n  o  t     b  e     s  u  r  p  r  i  s  e  d     w  h  e  n     n  o  n  -  C  h  r  i  s  t  i  a  n  s     e  x  p  e  c  t     C  h  r  i  s  t  i  a  n  s  '     b  e  l  i  e  f  s     t  o     b  e     g  u  i  d  e  d     b  y     t  h  e     C  h  r  i  s  t  i  a  n  s  '     s  c  r  i  p  t  u  r  e  s     r  a  t  h  e  r     t  h  a  n     b  y     c  o  n  t  r  a  r  y     o  p  i  n  i  o  n  s  .  <  /  h  1  >"},

One thing that has always struck me as odd is hearing the inerrancy of God's word preached but the apparent contradictions to this. One of the most prevalent issues with this is the fact that God said that he would both preserve his word as well as guide anyone who seeks him.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">People born and raised into opposing sects of Christianity and are very likely to never leave that particular sect. The differences between the denominations are often pretty trivial but sometimes they are matters of salvation and ideas intrinsic to \"Christianity\" itself.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">If God isn't concerned enough to correct those issues that could potentially send an individual to Hell, that would seem to be a direct contradiction to his word.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">I had asked some pastor friends of mine this question and their responses were generally something to the tune of \"leaning upon your own understanding of the bible often leads people to be misled\" or even \"Satan can use the scriptures themselves to lead people astray while they feel they are pursuing righteousness\"</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">This line of thinking is even more problematic because it  proves that either God is incapable of correcting his followers or he simply doesn't care to do so. Two people earnestly seeking God's guidance should not be able to get different answers to their questions and yet this happens all the time.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">At the very least this proves that versions of the Bible that claim God will guide those who seek him are not correct. Ultimately you cannot know for a fact that you yourself are doing God's will or being misled by something that feels exactly like \"God's guidance\" but is in fact a case of holy identity theft.</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  \"  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  \"  >  D  i  f  f  e  r  e  n  t     s  e  c  t  s     o  f     C  h  r  i  s  t  i  a  n  i  t  y     d  i  s  p  r  o  v  e     C  h  r  i  s  t  i  a  n  i  t  y  <  /  h  1  >"},

It seems to be ridiculous to think that an omniscient omnipresent God is not fully aware of everything at all times, so the notion of hiding anything from God is silly. God's omnipotence should allow God to hide things from himself if he so chooses, but that should be a simple act of his all-powerful will. If God does not want to see our sins, then God can simply not look at them, so this cannot explain the crucifixion.</p><blockquote class=\"_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Among other things, the Crucifixion satisfied the requirement of the Law for the death of the sinner, and the Resurrection established Yeshua\u2019s permanent mastery of death.</p></blockquote><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Yet surely it must be God who makes the law, since God is omnipotent. Why would God make a law that would require someone's torturous death? And what could be the purpose of establishing Yeshua's mastery of death? These questions are courtesies in respect for the slim chance that someone might have an answer, because otherwise it is quite obvious that an all-loving and good God would <em class=\"_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE\">not</em> make a law that requires anyone to suffer a torturous death.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">The crucifixion is not a reasonable expectation based upon Christian theology. It seems the crucifixion is only a part of Christian theology because the Romans crucified Jesus, and Jesus's followers had no choice but to try to make sense of that event. It had nothing to do with God, and Christians have never been able to give a good explanation for it, and so it has become one of the most obvious clues that Christianity is false. It is nothing more than a religion that grew out of the cult that Jesus originally started.</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  \"  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  \"  >  T  h  e     C  r  u  c  i  f  i  x  i  o  n     m  a  k  e  s     n  o     s  e  n  s  e     i  f     C  h  r  i  s  t  i  a  n  i  t  y     i  s     t  r  u  e  .  <  /  h  1  >"},

However, it seems that Some of them do. What do I mean by  'extreme modesty\" I mean \"Modesty\" in many areas of life where it seems  modesty would not be required or to be excessive. Nietzsche said that  Christians suffer from extreme piety but in my opinion it seems that  Some Protestants suffer from \"extreme modesty.\"</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Bare  in mind, you can be \"Culturally Protestant\" or \"Culturally from X\"  religion despite not being attending Church nor having a religious  belief. Just by virtue of being from that city or state. Some of these  examples might apply more to American culture by I have also seen a bit  of these <em class=\"_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE\">\"modesty culture\"</em> in Germany and the UK.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">*My  argument is the following: It seems Catholic or former Catholic  countries have a concept of \"Sensuality\" this has to do with  \"expression\" and \"expressing yourself\" and \"feelings\" meanwhile it seems  in Protestants countries there seems to be \"modesty\" plus a concept of  embarassment \"*verlegenheit.\"</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Of  course, some people might say my examples are not strong enough but I  think they are a \"microcosm\" of a large structural culture which is  somewhat invisible unless you studying  in more depth: Calvinism,  Lutheranism and Evangelism.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\"><strong class=\"_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU\">Example #1(Concrete Example)</strong></p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Say  you buy a nice shirt for yourself. It seems that some \"Protestants\"  will find it \"Pretentious.\" This could also be a English thing, like an  England vs France reason. But I have this type of talk in German as  well.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\"><strong class=\"_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU\">Example #2(Real example:Music)</strong></p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">There  was a Mexican Girl(Culturally Catholic) who gave Drake Bell a hug/kiss  and their English speaking audience, was shocked. They said, \"Where are  your morals.\" Or \"Why is she so shameless.\"</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\"><strong class=\"_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU\">Example # 3(Real Example:Television)</strong></p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">I  have been watching a lot of Italian television and noticed that the  character will say something. Then regret it and apologize. But they are  much more \"expressive\" of emotion. I heard the English Speaking  audience say they are \"Drama Queens\"</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\"><strong class=\"_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU\">Example #4(Real Example: Soccer)</strong></p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">The  American Soccer Coach wears a plain t-shirt. While many of the Soccer  Coaches in Europe wear suits. Now some people say that its his personal  choice. However, I believe he is \"Culturally Protestant\" since in a  previous thread some of you said \"Protestants\" shun upon wearing  \"ostentatious clothes\" since its draws your attention away from God.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\"><strong class=\"_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU\">Example #5(Celebrity Culture)</strong></p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Emma  Watson and many other celebrities are always trying to be modest, even  to the point where it sounds unrealistic. Some people said that audience  will \"dislike\" them if they started giving more honest answers.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\"><strong class=\"_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU\">Example #6(Conversations)</strong></p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Closely  related to #5, I noticed that in France and Italy people talk more  about \"Intellectual\" topics and you can name dropped thinkers. While in  the Protestant countries this would be \"unfriendly\" and \"pretentious.\" I  am still studying German Culture in more depth hence, I can't guarantee  it happens there as well but I have see it in the English Speaking  Countries.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\"><strong class=\"_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU\">Conclusions</strong>:  There are just a few examples, I could go on and on.

Permitting slavery is immoral.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">P2. God permitted slavery.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">C. Therefore, God is immoral.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">For argument\u2019s sake, let us assume that slavery is where the master owns the slave against their will, not something like indentured servitude, and something that the Christian God allowed in the Old Testament.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">This leaves a logically valid argument, P2 as true, and P1 as the only premise to attack, so let us object to P1.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">P1 Refutation:</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">An action\u2019s moral status depends on the moral agent\u2019s knowledge of the action\u2019s consequences.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">For example, if one goes up to somebody walking on the train tracks and pushes them down for no reason, then they have obviously acted immorally. The person pushed risks getting hurt for no reason.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">However, if the pusher has knowledge of an oncoming train and knows the consequences of pushing the person will save their life, then they have acted morally.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">So, it seems clear that an action\u2019s morality is at least somewhat determined by their knowledge of consequences.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">This serves as a dual objection to SA since it has implications for 1) the person making the argument and 2) if God can morally allow seemingly immoral actions.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">First, just like our friends knowledge of the oncoming train justified them pushing the person off the tracks, God\u2019s foreknowledge could justify Him in allowing slavery (or you can swap out any seemingly immoral deed). You\u2019ll notice in the OT passages God never comes out and says \u201cHey, it\u2019s a great idea to allow slavery; the concept of one of you owning the other and treating them badly is a great thing for everyone, etc.\u201d It\u2019s more like He tolerates and sets rules around it given the situations.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Second, even if God did act immorally by allowing slavery, the one making the argument SA is in no position to know this. God could have a good reason for allowing it, like our friend had a good reason to push someone off the tracks. So even if the argument is sound, the one making it is just guessing and got lucky. They didn\u2019t actually make a good argument (i.e., one based on knowledge).</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">In sum, SA\u2019s proponent should reflect that if P1 is true, it is either necessarily true or possibly true. If SA\u2019s proponent wants to say that P1 is necessarily true, then they need to show that God cannot have a justification for allowing it (an impossible task). If SA\u2019s proponent wants to say that P1 is only possibly true, then the argument falls apart: the conclusion is then, weakly, that God is only possibly immoral (just like I possibly don\u2019t exist).</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">SA\u2019s proponent should also realize that my refutation\u2019s form extends to any case where the arguer simply lacks the knowledge required to make the argument: hell is immoral, etc.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Lastly, we should recognize that my refutation is not simply restating that \u201cGod works in mysterious ways, we don\u2019t know why He allowed slavery.\u201d The refutation\u2019s form completely neutralizes SA: at best, SA shows that God was possibly immoral (so what when possibilities come cheap?) At worst, SA does nothing (if SA\u2019s proponent wants to take the road of saying that God couldn\u2019t possibly have a good reason, which would require knowledge of the relevant consequences, which SA\u2019s proponent can never have).</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  \"  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  \"  >  T  h  e     S  l  a  v  e  r  y     P  r  o  b  l  e  m  :     a  n     E  p  i  s  t  e  m  i  c     S  o  l  u  t  i  o  n  <  /  h  1  >"},

Let's not talk about those (I'm not talking about those) <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">someone</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">is</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">going</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">to</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">respond</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">just</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">to</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">this</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">first</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">sentence</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">and</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">want</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">to</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">talk</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">about</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">those</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">I</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">promise,</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">and</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">it's</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">gonna</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">be</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">hilarious.</sup> Let's focus just on the arguments that everyone who is even vaguely reasonable, pretty much knows are bad.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">If you just reject those arguments (certain terms and conditions apply, I explain more below). You end up rejecting... kinda everything. Like, the sheer number of dumb christian arguments, created a wall of skepticism that is too high for almost any other belief to climb over. Nothing else (or almost nothing else) meets the standard of simply \"doing better\" than these bad arguments in favor of Christianity. Mostly because we just don't spend a lot of time justifying and rationalizing the majority of the things we believe on a day to day basis) Here are some of the arguments I can think of:</p><ul class=\"_33MEMislY0GAlB78wL1_CR\"><li class=\"_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\"><strong class=\"_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU\">Argument from (biased) Authority:</strong> My parents, or my pastor, or someone I trust told me to be a Christian, and I did, and I liked it so I never went back.

I think we can all agree that these are bad arguments. I have phrased them humorously for the sake of readability, but I don't think it's a strawman because even more seriously worded variants just don't work. You shouldn't believe things just because someone told you, or because it makes you happy, or because you read it in a book that the idea literally comes from. Right? Right?</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">I WANT to reject all of these reasons. I WANT these to be bad arguments. But what happens to my thought life if I reject every idea that is supported by one or more of these bad arguments? What do I have left that i can think is good, or commit to, or believe in, if I reject:</p><ul class=\"_33MEMislY0GAlB78wL1_CR\"><li class=\"_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Anything that I believe or do only because someone I trusted said so (and I haven't gone and checked it out extensively in an objective and impartial way)</p></li><li class=\"_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Anything that I believe or do just because I tried it and liked it</p></li><li class=\"_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Anything I believe or do because I heard good things</p></li><li class=\"_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Anything I believe or do just in case something terrible (but improbable) happens, to cover my butt</p></li><li class=\"_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Anything I believe or do just because I want to</p></li><li class=\"_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Anything I believe or do because I worry I would indulge bad habits otherwise</p></li><li class=\"_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Anything I believe or do because a book about believing or doing it endorses believing or doing it</p></li><li class=\"_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Anything I can't remember why I believe or do, but I was sure at the time</p></li><li class=\"_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Anything I believe or do just because I always have</p></li><li class=\"_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Anything I believe or do because I prefer it to the alternatives I know about</p></li><li class=\"_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Anything I believe or do just cuz</p></li></ul><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Like.... those arguments were so puny and insignificant a minute ago. But now what can I justify?</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Consider a statement like \"Exercise is good for you\" How would I go about defending that? Well, doctors and personal trainers and gym teachers all agree... but they are all obviously biased in favor of exercise. I can try it and feel myself getting healthier, but that's subjective. I have lots of anecdotes... But if you ask me to prove it... I can't.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">I think a choice of religion is a big choice that affects a lot of life socially and otherwise, so it's a lot like nationality. How would I defend a statement like \"I (should continue to) live in the USA\" Well, my friends and family are here, I've just sorta always lived here. I was born here. If I left I don't know where I would go... I don't have a good answer.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Why do I think Android is better than iPhone, or that the Longhorns are better than the Aggies. I dunno. I just sorta DO!</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">I suspect a lot of you will spout off about \"Extraordinary claims\" and I hear you. But it seems to me that these arguments aren't just insufficient for extraordinary claims, they are actually dumb for any claim. Even so, what would be an extraordinary claim that I have accepted on the basis of extraordinary evidence? How about \"There used to be a race of giant lizards that roamed the planet called Dinosaurs\" Okay. Where? I've never seen one. Even the bones I saw at the museum were literally fake. They told me at the museum they had fake bones on display and the real bones were hidden somewhere.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Even concepts like \"I Exist\" are really really really hard to justify. Like, I've read Descartes, \"I think therefore I am\" but that's literally the John 3:16 of the book on justifying I exist. How many books have I read on the possibility that I might not exist? And maybe I exist in some form, but is the person I call \"me\" actually accurate? Am I the same person I remember being as a child? Is the image I have in my head of myself the same person who actually IS? How the hell would I know?</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Is there ANYTHING that anyone here can actualy justify without appealing to one or more of these dumb reasons? I leave open the possibility that there may be one or two things, but I can't think of them. And there certainly aren't enough to live a functional life.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">We've gotten so good at debunking, we seem to have entirely lost track of how to \"bunk\".</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Terms and Conditions: <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">*When</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">I</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">say</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">\"reject</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">these</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">arguments'</sup> ' <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">I</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">mean</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">to</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">imply</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">that</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">you</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">reject</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">them</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">all.</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">And</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">you</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">reject</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">them</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">unilaterally:</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">that</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">is,</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">you</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">reject</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">them</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">on</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">the</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">basis</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">that</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">they</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">are</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">just</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">stupid</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">and</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">bad</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">and</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">not</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">a</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">good</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">way</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">to</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">determing</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">what</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">to</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">believe</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">in,</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">instead</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">of</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">rejecting</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">them</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">in</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">some</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">specific</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">contextual</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">way</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">for</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">why</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">that</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">specific</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">argument</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">does</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">not</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">apply</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">to</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">that</sup> <sup class=\"_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE\">specific.*</sup></p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">CONCLUSION: I dunno nothing really.

Why did God not start the book with an accurate and detailed account of the start of our universe? Why didn't he write a few books outlining basic physics chemistry and biology? Probably would be more helpful than anything in the back half of the Old Testament. If God really wanted what was best for us, he probably should've written down how diseases spread and how to build proper sanitation systems and vaccines. Jews (and I presume some Christians, but I have only ever heard Jews say this) love to brag about how the Torah demands we wash our hands before we eat as if that is proof of divine inspiration, but it would've been a lot more helpful if God expalined <em class=\"_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE\">why</em> to do that.

In this post my aim is to demonstrate the issues with Baha\u2019i attempts to reconcile the two. To organize my thoughts, my \u2018opening statement\u2019 if you will is this;</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Modern Baha\u2019i apologia emphasizes two points in order to make its stance on homosexuality palatable to liberal sensibilities. The first is that the Faith \u201chates the sin not the sinner\u201d and one is free to be a homosexual Baha\u2019i so long as they remain \u2018publicly\u2019 celibate. The second is to argue that the Faith does not impose its stances on non-Baha\u2019is.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">I feel that these two points are legitimately believed by most Baha\u2019is, however I believe both are fundamentally incompatible with the philosophy outlined by the authoritative figures of the Faith for two reasons.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">The first is that the Faith does not recognize homosexuality as a legitimate identity, instead viewing it as an aberration which can and should be cured. While in terms of administrative sanction the Faith does not advocate for actively seeking out \u2018celibate\u2019 homosexuals for reprimand or intervention philosophically this is exactly what the Faith actually advocates and is what the teachings expect of homosexuals joining the community.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">The second is that the Faith\u2019s explicit aim is to assume governance of society and it explicitly rejects the idea that the Faith will not impose Baha\u2019i laws on society at some point in the future.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Before supporting my arguments as some background, I should note that while in most religious traditions it is entirely incorrect to make blanket statements about what a religious \u201cis\u201d or what it believes based on administrative communications, however the structure of the Baha\u2019i Faith is such that its entire belief system is defined by its administrative communications with disagreement and reformation not really being possible. In the Will and Testament of \u2018Abdu\u2019l-Baha the following open mandate is given to the two bodies which I will draw most of my quotations from:</p><blockquote class=\"_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">\u201cThe sacred and youthful branch, the Guardian of the Cause of God, as well as the Universal House of Justice, to be universally elected and established, are both under the care and protection of the Abh\u00e1 Beauty, under the shelter and unerring guidance of the Exalted One (may my life be offered up for them both). Whatsoever they decide is of God. Whoso obeyeth him not, neither obeyeth them, hath not obeyed God; whoso rebelleth against him and against them hath rebelled against God; whoso opposeth him hath opposed God; whoso contendeth with them hath contended with God; whoso disputeth with him hath disputed with God; whoso denieth him hath denied God; whoso disbelieveth in him hath disbelieved in God; whoso deviateth, separateth himself and turneth aside from him hath in truth deviated, separated himself and turned aside from God. May the wrath, the fierce indignation, the vengeance of God rest upon him!\u201d -<a href=\"https://www.bahai.org/library/authoritative-texts/abdul-baha/will-testament-abdul-baha/2#189137811\" class=\"_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\"> https://www.bahai.org/library/authoritative-texts/abdul-baha/will-testament-abdul-baha/2#189137811</a></p></blockquote><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">So the above demonstrates that the Faith as it defines itself deems disagreeing with a statement of the Guardian or the Universal House of Justice to be disagreeing with God and being an action worthy of incurring his vengeance. Actively disagreeing with the philosophy of these bodies is punishable by excommunication and shunning, as such I feel I am justified in defining the views of the \u2018Baha\u2019i Faith\u2019 solely by the quotes below.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">With that preamble out of the way, here is a quote from a 1987 letter of the UHJ I feel debunks the argument that a homosexual can be a Baha\u2019i, they are merely asked to be celibate:</p><blockquote class=\"_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">\u201c...the Faith does not recognize homosexuality as a \"natural\" or permanent phenomenon. Rather, it sees this as an aberration subject to treatment, however intractable exclusive homosexuality may now seem to be. To the question of alteration of homosexual bents, much study must be given, and doubtless in the future clear principles of prevention and treatment will emerge. As for those now afflicted, a homosexual does not decide to be a problem human, but he does, as you rightly state, have decision in choosing his way of life, i.e. abstaining from homosexual acts.\u201d -<a href=\"https://bahai-library.com/compilation_homosexuality_bwc#s1\" class=\"_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\"> https://bahai-library.com/compilation_homosexuality_bwc#s1</a></p></blockquote><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">This I feel establishes that the idea that homosexual Baha\u2019is are fully accepted, they are just asked not to act on their desires, is an untenable position to hold without disagreeing with the UHJ. Here they explicitly say that it is an aberration which must be treated and authoritatively pronounce that homosexuality does not have a natural cause. They also advocate for research into conversion therapy, and the argument of Baha\u2019is that homosexuals are only expected to be celibate is shown to be temporary. The UHJ says that \u201cfor those now afflicted\u201d, I emphasize the word NOW.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Once these principles of prevention and treatment have hypothetically emerged is the stance of the Baha\u2019i Faith that homosexuals will have the choice of whether to maintain their aberration while being celibate? I believe this 1993 letter of the UHJ provides an answer in the negative:</p><blockquote class=\"_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">\u201c In consideration of the questions

are expected to overcome their affliction.If we read this quote with the context that the UHJ has stated that principles for preventing and treating/curing homosexuality will be developed I do not believe it is a stretch to say that the UHJ is saying that homosexuals who become Baha\u2019is will be expected to undertake whatever methods they devise to cure homosexuality in the future. The 1987 quote clearly states that homosexuality is an aberration which is to be treated, then makes a distinction between homosexuality and homosexual acts in order to state that while homosexuality can not currently be treated abstaining from homosexual acts is the only course of action to be taken. Clearly the objection in the 1987 letter is in fact to homosexuality as a state of being, and not merely with acting on homosexual impulses.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">With that out of the way, I would like to address the second Baha\u2019i point, that Baha\u2019i law will only apply to Baha\u2019is. I will state in advance I feel there is more room to disagree with my argument on why this is invalid.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">The crux of my view that the Baha\u2019i Faith explicitly aims to impose its laws is a 1995 letter in which the UHJ explicitly states that the Baha\u2019i Faith does not believe in separation of church and state (apologies for wall of text, but feel a shorter excerpt would remove too much context):</p><blockquote class=\"_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">\u201cYou also ask how these statements could be reconciled with Shoghi Effendi\u2019s comment on page 149 of Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed Administration, which appears to anticipate \u201ca future that is sure to witness the formal and complete separation of Church and State,\u201d and with the following words in his letter of 21 March 1932 addressed to the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00eds of the United States and Canada:</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Theirs is not the purpose, while endeavoring to conduct and perfect the administrative affairs of their Faith, to violate, under any circumstances, the provisions of their country\u2019s constitution, much less to allow the machinery of their administration to supersede the government of their respective countries.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">A careful reading of the letter dated 6 December 1928 in which the Guardian\u2019s comment about the separation of Church and State occurs would suggest that, rather than enunciating a general principle, Shoghi Effendi is simply reviewing \u201cthe quickening forces of internal reform\u201d that had \u201crecently transpired throughout the Near and Middle East,\u201d and enumerating a number of factors that impinge on the development of the Faith in those parts of the world.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">As for the statement made by Shoghi Effendi in his letter of 21 March 1932, the well-established principles of the Faith concerning the relationship of the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed institutions to those of the country in which the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00eds reside make it unthinkable that they would ever purpose to violate a country\u2019s constitution or so to meddle in its political machinery as to attempt to take over the powers of government. This is an integral element of the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed principle of abstention from involvement in politics. However, this does not by any means imply that the country itself may not, by constitutional means, decide to adopt Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed laws and practices and modify its constitution or method of government accordingly. The relationship between the principle of abstention from involvement in politics and the emergence of the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed State is commented on later in this letter. In the meantime we can quote the following extracts from letters written on behalf of the Guardian in response to queries from individual believers, which indicate that the relationship is an evolving one:\u201d - &gt;<a href=\"https://www.bahai.org/library/authoritative-texts/the-universal-house-of-justice/messages/19950427_001/1#267741950\" class=\"_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.bahai.org/library/authoritative-texts/the-universal-house-of-justice/messages/19950427_001/1#267741950</a></p></blockquote><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">While the Faith does not seek to impose its views through partisan politics (and thankfully for homosexuals is likely never going to achieve the scenario outlined above) it does want to see a future in which constitutions are rewritten to adopt Baha\u2019i laws and principles. This is a positive in regards to rights of women and resolving racial prejudice, but I believe I have demonstrated above that due to the UHJ\u2019s official philosophy this scenario would also lead to state sponsored conversion therapy being imposed.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Now the one objection which could hold water is that one could argue that while the UHJ condemns homosexuality as an aberration which must be suppressed temporarily until methods of eradicating it are developed, this could be classified as advice rather than a law. I believe the following quote from Shoghi Effendi debunks this reasoning as it establishes that the Baha\u2019i Faith essentially considers homosexuality to be a crime as it is defined as a sanctionable offense:</p><blockquote class=\"_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">\u201cRegarding the question you asked him about one of the believers who seems to be flagrantly homosexual -- although to a certain extent we must be forbearing in the matter of people's moral conduct because of the terrible deterioration in society in general, this does not mean that we can put up indefinitely with conduct which is disgracing the Cause. The person should have it brought to his attention that such acts are condemned by Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h, and that he must mend his ways, if necessary consult doctors, and make every effort to overcome this affliction, which is corruptive for him and bad for the Cause. If after a period of probation you do not see an improvement, he should have his voting rights taken away. The Guardian does not think, however, that a Bah\u00e1'\u00ed body should take it upon itself to denounce him to the Authorities unless his conduct borders on insanity.\u201d -<a href=\"https://bahai-library.com/compilation_homosexuality_bwc#s1\" class=\"_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\"> https://bahai-library.com/compilation_homosexuality_bwc#s1</a></p></blockquote><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">And while one may downplay removal of voting rights as a benign punishment Shoghi Effendi himself defined it as a harsh penalty (the harshest possible defined in Baha'i administrative guidance, with the exception of excommunication which is only for specifically challenging the structure of divine authority within the religion):</p><blockquote class=\"_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">\"The general basis for the deprivation of voting rights is of course gross immorality and open opposition to the administrative functions of the Faith, and disregard for the laws of personal status; and even then it is the duty of the National Assembly, before exercising this sanction, to confer with the individuals involved in a loving manner to help them overcome the problem; second, to warn them that they must desist; third, to issue further warnings if the original warnings are not followed; and finally, if there seems no other way to handle the matter, then a person may be deprived of voting rights.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">\"The Guardian however, wishes the National Assemblies to be very cautious in using this sanction, because it might be abused, and then lose its efficacy. It should be used only when there seems no other way to solve the problem.\u201d -</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\"><a href=\"https://bahai.works/Lights_of_Guidance/Administrative_Rights,_Sanctions,_Dissimulation\" class=\"_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">https://bahai.works/Lights_of_Guidance/Administrative_Rights,_Sanctions,_Dissimulation</a></p></blockquote><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">In conclusion, while I think contemporary Baha\u2019is wholeheartedly believe in their convictions of abolishing all prejudice and their arguments that the Baha\u2019i Faith is not homophobic are made in good faith, their reasoning is based on ignorance of what the authoritative philosophy of the Baha\u2019i administration is.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Based on the above I feel the Baha'i community as a whole is rather disingenuous (largely unintentionally) on the issue of sexuality, and it strikes me that individual Baha'is discussing sexuality put a huge amount of effort into being sensitive and empathic towards homosexuals while attempting to grapple with what their religion teaches, whereas the idealized 'infallible' figures of the Faith just made incredibly blunt statements about corruption and afflictions. It is an interesting phenomenon that a religious community feels the need to routinely alter the textual rhetoric of figures it considers to speak directly for God while also not feeling in any way that they are disagreeing with those figures. This is a particularly curious phenomenon  with respect to the Faith. The very centralized nature of its theological framework (with no views having any weight except the Central Figures, Guardian,  and UHJ) generally Baha'is dedicate themselves to utilizing meticulous direct quotation in making arguments, with perhaps the sole exception being discussions on homosexuality in which they will instead paraphrase and avoid direct quotations.</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  \"  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  \"  >  T  h  e     B  a  h  a  '  i     F  a  i  t  h  :     A     r  e  b  u  t  t  a  l     t  o     a  t  t  e  m  p  t  s     t  o     r  e  c  o  n  c  i  l  e     t  h  e     B  a  h  a  '  i     F  a  i  t  h     a  n  d     h  o  m  o  p  h  o  b  i  a     p  r  e  s  e  n  t     i  n     i  t  s     p  h  i  l  o  s  o  p  h  y  <  /  h  1  >"},

In Dearborn they're freaking out about the LGBTQ books that are allegedly \"grooming\" children, but have no issue with Aisha being groomed to be Mohammad's bride, or the offer of virgins in heaven. Apparently that's not grooming either, according to them.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">And in Buddhism homosexuality is considered to be \"misconduct\" and conflated with various forms of sexual abuse that are also in theory disallowed <del>among clergy</del>. And yet when Buddhist teachers and clergy have turned out to be sexual predators and child rapists, higher ups have recommended that their abused students continue to treat the teachers with the same filial piety as always.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">***correction: As it turns out, it is not just clergy for whom gay sex is considered misconduct in Buddhism.

Sorry for misinforming!</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">*So in summation, to be clear, since religious people report having an interest in stopping abuse and violence (and since I and many others would certainly prefer that religious people not lie and slander LGBTQ+ people as groomers and perverts and advocate that we be executed) religions and religious people should therefore stop slandering us as groomers and advocating that we be executed and instead begin trying to mitigate the untold damage and abuse on a mass scale caused by institutions they affiliate with, abuses which include thousands and thousands of <em class=\"_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE\"><strong class=\"_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU\">actual</strong></em> cases of violence and grooming, which were covered up and denied and ignored for as long as possible ......

For example, (and this will be my prime example) the story of the Exodus is completely without foundation. No authentic record of Egyptian antiquity ever records anything like the Exodus, and the Egyptian records that Christians point to as support of the Exodus either blatantly contradict the Bible, or they refer to something else that should be viewed in its own context. The point is,the Bible claims that extremely extravagant events happened in history, despite the fact that there is no evidence to support such an assertion. How can one believe that the Bible is god inspired, when it contains such  blatant myths?</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  \"  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  \"  >  T  h  e     B  i  b  l  e     i  s     h  i  s  t  o  r  i  c  a  l  l  y     i  n  a  c  c  u  r  a  t  e     a  n  d     t  h  e  r  e  f  o  r  e     n  o  t     t  h  e     w  o  r  d     o  f     G  o  d  .  <  /  h  1  >"},

The evidence for this is that Mohammad, the individual who invented Islam, took a child bride when he was in his 50's. According to writings, he both married her and years later consummated the marriage before his wife's age could be counted in double digits. This is not an attack or an insult. This is a fact one can google. Aisha was married at 6 and then slept with her when she was 9.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Today, I would hope that modern day Muslims condemn the practice of child brides. I believe most do. Muslims are not awful people and by and large are quite peaceful. There's a lot that's good about them and even about their religion. However, I do not understand the mental gymnastics Muslims go through to reconcile condemning children brides versus the actions of their prophet. I do not understand how Muslims can claim morality is objective if something so clearly abhorrent was right for one person AND wrong for everyone else at the same time. Do I have it wrong? Do Muslims claim that morality is subjective?</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  \"  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  \"  >  M  o  d  e  r  n     d  a  y     M  u  s  l  i  m  s     c  a  n  n  o  t     m  a  k  e     c  l  a  i  m  s     t  o     a  b  s  o  l  u  t  e     m  o  r  a  l  i  t  y  .  <  /  h  1  >"},

I felt like I needed a purpose in life. I\u2019d go to youth group and the message of \u2018God loves you and God has a purpose for you\u2019, in addition to the music and group think..  really resonated with me to the point where I decided to beieve in Jesus/God. At this time in my life I didn\u2019t know any \u2018apologetical\u2019 arguments for God\u2019s existence besides stuff my youth pastor would say, such as: \"how do you get something from nothing, how do you get order from chaos\u2019\u201d. I believed in Adam and Eve, a young earth, a young human species..ect. I have a speech impediment. I was aware that If you asked God to heal you, and if you earnestly asked it, he would. I asked him to heal it and he didn\u2019t. I rationalized it with: maybe God wants to use what I have for his benefit, or maybe God has a better plan for me. My belief in God was based on a more psychological grounding involving being,  purpose, and rationalizations rather than evidence/reasoning, logic.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">It wasn\u2019t until I went to college and learned about anthropology/human evolution where my beliefs about God became challeneged. An example was: \u201cif The earth is billions of years old, and human are hundred thousands of years old, why does the timeline really only go back 6-10k years? The order of creation isn\u2019t even scentifically correct. If we evolved, then we weren\u2019t made from dust/clay... and there really wasn\u2019t an Adam and Eve, and the house of cards began to fall.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">The reason I bring this up is.. I feel when having \u2018debates\u2019 regarding which religion is true.. which religion has the best proofs.. the best evidence.. ect.. I feel the relgious side isn\u2019\u2019t being completely honest insofar as WHY they believe in God in the first place.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">It\u2019s been my understanding, now as an Atheist, that \u2018evidence/reason/logic\u2019, whatever term you want to use, is only supplemented into the belief structure to support a belief that is based in emotion and psychological grounding. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve found it so difficult to debate Theists. If reason/evidence/logic is why you believe God exists, then showing you why your reason/logic/evidence is bad SHOULD convince you that you don\u2019t have a good reason to believe in God. Instead, it doesn\u2019t; the belief persists.</p><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">So I ask, what is your fundamental reason for holding a belief in whatever religion you subscribe to? Is it truly based in evidence/reason/logic.. or are you comfortable with saying your religion may not be true, but believing it makes you feel good by filling an existential void in your life?</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  \"  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  \"  >  F  u  n  d  a  m  e  n  t  a  l     R  e  a  s  o  n     f  o  r     y  o  u  r     R  e  l  i  i  g  o  u  s     B  e  l  i  e  f  <  /  h  1  >"},

If this is true, there is no evidence to suggest that this cause would have to be a god, but even if it did, it also means that something else had to cause god to exist, and something had to cause that to exist which obviously leads to an infinite regression.

It simply cannot be had both ways.</p></li><li class=\"_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz\"><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Things can simply begin to exist without cause, this eliminates the problem of infinite regression, but also pretty obviously allows the universe to exist without god.</p></li></ol><p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">I would also posit that any possible objection in favor of god necessarily relies on a special pleading fallacy, and can be rejected.</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  \"  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  \"  >  T  h  e     \u201c  P  r  o  b  l  e  m  \u201d     o  f     S  o  m  e  t  h  i  n  g     C  o  m  i  n  g     F  r  o  m     N  o  t  h  i  n  g     i  s     a     T  e  r  r  i  b  l  e     A  r  g  u  m  e  n  t     f  o  r     G  o  d  <  /  h  1  >"},
