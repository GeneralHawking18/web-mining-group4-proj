<p class="">Fifteen Republican states on Monday night asked a federal judge to keep a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/dhs-officials-concerned-may-need-2-billion-deal-migrant-surge-border-d-rcna29792" target="_blank">Covid-era policy</a> in place that allowed authorities to severely restrict asylum-seekers from crossing the border into the country after the judge issued a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/judge-blocks-trump-border-rule-title-42-expelled-migrants-rcna57379" target="_blank">ruling</a> last week that blocked the rule.</p> <p class="">The GOP states said that lifting the rule, which the Biden admin straight has sought to end, will increase the flow of migrants and “directly harm” them.</p> <p class="">“Because invalidation of the Title 42 Orders will directly harm the States, they now seek to intervene to offer a defense of the Title 42 policy so that its validity can be resolved on the merits, rather than through strategic surrender,” the states said in their filing Monday. </p> <p class="">They argue that an increase in migrant flows to the border will “impose financial burdens on the states involuntarily hosting them” and that the states themselves are “entitled to special solitude in the standing analysis.”</p> <p class="">“The States have sovereign and quasi-sovereign interests in controlling their borders, limiting the persons present within those borders, excluding persons carrying communicable diseases, and the enforcement of immigration law,” the filing said.</p> <p class="">Last week, U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/judge-blocks-trump-border-rule-title-42-expelled-migrants-rcna57379" target="_blank">vacated</a> the controversial rule, known as Title 42, which U.S. Customs and Border Protection has used to turn back migrants at the border before they could make asylum claims. Sullivan sided with the American Civil Liberties Union and other immigration advocates, who argue that the rule was being used a tool to enforce the border more than a public health measure.</p> <p class="">Sullivan cited the Administrative Procedures Act in his ruling, and characterized Title 42 as “arbitrary and capricious.” The Biden administration indicated that it won’t oppose Sullivan’s order in a court filing last week, but requested a temporary delay in lifting Title 42.</p> <p class="">The Department of Homeland Security requested five weeks “to prepare to transition” to processing all migrants under pre-Covid policies, allowing them to cross the southern border to claim asylum. In his order, Sullivan granted the request with “great reluctance.” Title 42 is set to come to an end on Dec. 20, taking effect on midnight Dec. 21.</p> <p class="">“To be clear...Title 42 would remain in place for some period. During the period of this freeze, we will prepare for an orderly transition to new policies at the border,” DHS said in a statement last week.</p> <p class="">Sullivan’s ruling last week was issued months after a federal judge in <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/judge-blocks-biden-ending-trump-imposed-covid-restrictions-migrants-bo-rcna29905" target="_blank">Louisiana ruled</a> in favor of an attempt by the same 15 states — Arizona, Louisiana, Alabama, Alaska, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming — to keep the policy in place.</p> <p class="">Lee Gelernt of ACLU, lead lawyer for the plaintiffs seeking to lift Title 42, pushed back against the GOP states seeking to keep the rule in place in a statement to NBC News.</p> <p class="">“Title 42 is not about general border enforcement but public health, and these states cannot plausibly claim they are seeking to intervene because of their concern about COVID,” Gelernt said. </p> <p class="">In April, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas formally announced that the agency would end Title 42 on May 23 and allow families and single adult asylum-seekers who had been turned away at the border to enter the U.S. At the time, thousands of migrants were living in poor conditions and camps in northern Mexico after having been turned back from crossing.</p> <p class="endmark">The Biden administration has faced pushback from both parties for its handling of Title 42. Republicans have <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/clash-immigration-stalls-covid-relief-funds-congress-potentially-weeks-rcna23212" target="_blank">widely opposed</a> ending the policy, and some centrist Democrats <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/biden-blocked-winding-trump-era-border-policy-rcna26373" target="_blank">expressed skepticism</a> on whether the administration is prepared for an uptick of asylum-seekers.</p><p class="">Colorado Gov.

The state formally recognized same-sex marriage in 2014 — a year before <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/same-sex-marraige-legal-nationwide-supreme-court-rules-n375551" target="_blank">the Supreme Court decision</a> that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. In 2019,<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/colorado-governor-signs-gay-conversion-therapy-ban-n1012581" target="_blank"> Polis signed a law that would ban conversion therapy</a>, which seeks to change minors’ sexual orientation or gender identity, and another law that would make it easier for transgender people to update their gender on their birth certificates and other documents.</p> <p class="">Polis, who won re-election earlier this month, was part of the so-called <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/jared-polis-colorado-s-gaymer-governor-elect-talks-rainbow-wave-n950931" target="_blank">rainbow wave</a><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/colorado-s-jared-polis-projected-be-first-gay-man-elected-n932901" target="_blank"> </a>in 2018 — referring to the record number of LGBTQ candidates who ran for office in that year's midterm elections. He is the second out LGBTQ person to be elected governor of a state, after Gov. Kate Brown of Oregon, a Democrat who identifies as bisexual, was first elected in a special election in 2016.</p> <p class="">During Polis’ first gubernatorial run, his sexuality played only a small role in his run for governor, and he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/style/jared-polis-gay-governor.html" target="_blank">has said in past news interviews</a> that he found Colorado voters to be more concerned with kitchen-table issues. </p> <p class="">Though his campaign focused mainly on delivering more government services while continuing to grow Colorado’s booming economy, he has since become a vocal critic against the rise of attacks on the LGBTQ community in recent years.</p> <p class="">“Today Colorado took an important step forward in recognizing our diversity as a strength," Polis told NBC News in an emailed statement when he signed the 2019 bills. "These bills truly underscore the idea that Colorado is a state where everyone can be their true selves and live the life they want."</p> <p class="">Polis also has been critical of anti-LGBTQ laws in Republican-led states, which include bills pushing the prohibition of classroom discussions related to sexual orientation and gender identity.</p> <p class="">“Look, words matter. Laws matter. When a group of people, LGBTQ youth, feel targeted by the words and laws that some politicians espouse, of course, it can increase anxiety, depression,” Polis said in an interview with <a href="https://transcripts.cnn.com/show/sotu/date/2022-02-20/segment/01" target="_blank">CNN</a> earlier this year.</p> <p class="">Polis previously represented Colorado’s 2nd Congressional District for five terms. He first won elected office in 2008 and became, in his words, “the first openly gay parent to win a seat in Congress."

Brian Kemp in March 2021, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/georgia-passes-vast-restrictive-voting-law-limiting-early-voting-ballot-n1262101" target="_blank">cut in half the time</a> allowed between a general election and a runoff election — drastically shortening the period during which many voters must request, receive and cast ballots. The law's narrowed time frame also effectively cuts the early in-person voting period, from a minimum of 16 days in 2020 to a minimum of 5 in 2022, while existing rules have ensured almost no new voters will be eligible to vote in the runoff.</p> <p class="">Proponents of the bill's provisions on runoffs argue that cutting the period eases a long and arduous process for everyone involved. The law's authors <a href="https://www.legis.ga.gov/api/legislation/document/20212022/201498" target="_blank">even wrote into the bill </a>that "the lengthy nine-week runoffs in 2020 were exhausting for candidates, donors, and 120 electors." Other supporters, including Gabriel Sterling, the chief operating officer in the Office of the Georgia Secretary of State, note that before 2013, the state's runoff period was four weeks and that the elections ran without problems.</p> <p class="">"This is not the first time we've had to do this," Sterling said at <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?524156-1/georgia-secretary-state-brad-raffensperger-update-senate-runoff-election#" target="_blank">a news conference</a> last week. "This is not that unique."</p> <p class="">But voting rights advocates, both in Georgia and around the country, say the new law's changes present challenges. </p> <p class="">“It was not just that the runoff date was moved up, it’s that the period to get so many steps done has been condensed,” said Danielle Lang, the senior director of the voting rights unit at the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan voting watchdog group.</p> <p class="">“The big takeaway here is that the compressing of the time line for a runoff has spillover effects on access for voters,” she said.</p> <p class="">Here are several of the ways the new law could affect voters in the runoff.</p> <p class="">Under SB 202, Georgia runoff elections now take place 28 days after the general election — less than half the original nine-week period that existed before the law. This year’s runoff will take place on Dec. 6, following the Nov. 8 midterms. </p> <p class="">The law, however, does not change an existing rule that voters must register at least 30 days before an election.</p> <p class="">As a result, new voters who weren’t registered for the general election <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/georgia-organizations-push-keep-black-voters-energized-crucial-senate-rcna57160">will not be able to register </a>in time to vote in the runoff  because the deadline will have already passed.</p> <p class="">That’s a stark difference from the landscape in the state in 2020 — that year both of the state’s U.S. Senate races advanced to a runoff that would determine control of the chamber — when candidates and outside groups rushed to register droves of new voters.</p> <p class="">“The bottom line is that nobody can vote in this runoff who didn’t register as of Nov. 7,” said Lang. She added there’s likely still a narrow new pool of voters who registered too late to vote in the general election but could make the 30-day deadline for the runoff.</p> <p class="">Domestic, absentee mail-in ballot voters will now have a much shorter window in which to do everything required of them to cast their ballots on time.</p> <p class="">Before SB 202, these voters would have had nine weeks to request an absentee ballot, receive that ballot and mail it in or drop it off. Now they will have to do all that in half the time.</p> <p class="">Under existing runoff procedures, most Georgians who want to cast an absentee mail-in ballot (voters 65 and older and disabled voters will be sent an absentee mail-in ballot automatically if registered to vote) must first request such a ballot, in compliance with the law's new voter ID requirement. The deadline for local election officials to receive those absentee ballot applications is Nov. 25, the day after Thanksgiving. </p> <p class="">If most voters don’t mail their applications well before the Nov. 25 deadline, local election officials could be dealing with a backlog upon returning from the Thanksgiving weekend on Monday Nov. 28 — the same day early in-person voting will begin in most counties. </p> <p class="">The law mandates that the ballots must be mailed to voters within three days of receipt of the applications — a tight time frame that advocates warn may not be met, given that the deadline overlaps with a holiday and comes just days before the start of early in-person voting.</p> <p class="">Once voters receive their absentee ballots, they must choose their candidates and mail those ballots back, again in compliance with the voter ID requirement. Absentee mail-in ballots received before 7 p.m. on the day of the election — Dec. 6 — will be counted, per Georgia’s law. Voters may also deposit their absentee ballots in drop boxes.</p> <p class="">Voting rights activists, who have worked to bolster awareness of the new rules through voter education initiatives, expressed concern that the deadlines would sneak up on voters, especially with the holiday.</p> <p class="">“The shorter time frame may be a challenge to voters who don't realize how quickly some of these deadline are going to come up or who haven't thought through how they are going to vote,” said Andrew Garber, an attorney at the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law. </p> <p class="">Under a separate provision of SB 202, overseas and military absentee voters were provided a ranked choice voting ballot as their general election ballot weeks before the general election so that, in the event of a runoff, their vote would have already been mailed in. </p> <p class="">This keeps SB 202 in compliance with a federal law requiring that overseas and military absentee voters be mailed their ballots 45 days before a federal election.</p> <p class="">Because of the condensed time frame between the general election and the runoff, many Georgia voters will also be looking at a shortened, five-day, weekday-only period of early in-person voting.</p> <p class="">Plus, due to an ongoing lawsuit against the state, it remains uncertain whether one Saturday early voting day, on Nov. 26, will be allowed.</p> <p class="">SB 202 stipulates that early in-person voting must end the Friday before the runoff. This year, that would be Friday Dec. 2. </p> <p class="">The law, as interpreted by the Georgia secretary of state’s office,<strong> </strong>also stipulates that early in-person voting not be held on any Saturday that follows a “public or legal holiday” on the preceding Thursday or Friday. This year, that would mean there would be no early in-person voting on Nov. 26, the Saturday following Thanksgiving. </p> <p class="">But a Fulton County judge <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/win-democrats-georgia-judge-allows-early-voting-senate-runoff-saturday-rcna57983" target="_blank">ruled Friday that the office</a> cannot prohibit counties from allowing voting that day, after a voting rights group, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/15/us/politics/warnock-early-voting-georgia.html" target="_blank">along with Warnock</a> and his campaign, <a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/democrats-sue-georgia-over-early-voting-guidance-for-senate-runoff/">sued</a> the state, claiming  the specific language of the law suggested that the barring of Saturday voting after a holiday — in this case Thanksgiving — doesn’t actually apply to runoff elections.</p> <p class="">Georgia’s attorney general plans to appeal, a spokesperson for the office told NBC News. As a result, whether counties can offer voting that day remains in limbo.</p> <p class="">If voting is ultimately not allowed on that Saturday, SB 202 says Saturday voting should be held the previous weekend (in this year’s case, Saturday, Nov. 19). But under Georgia law, runoff voting may not begin until after officials have certified the general election vote, which will be on Monday, Nov. 21, per the Georgia Secretary of State’s office. That means, no Saturday voting will be allowed on Nov. 19, either. </p> <p class="">Whether the judiciary allows voting on Nov. 26 or not, the only other days most voters will  be able to vote early in-person will be from Monday Nov. 28 to Friday Dec. 2. The law states that early voting “shall end on the Friday immediately prior to each primary, election, or runoff.”</p> <p class="">That five-day period, however, represents the minimum required under the law, and county election officials have the discretion to schedule additional early-in person voting days that comply with the law's other rules, Lang and Garber and others said.</p> <p class="">Voting rights groups have pushed Georgia counties, for example, to open early-in person voting on Nov. 22, 23 and 27 (the Tuesday and Wednesday before Thanksgiving and the Sunday after). As of Friday, at least nine of the state's 159 <a href="https://twitter.com/GabrielSterling/status/1593622135716470784" target="_blank">counties</a> had <a href="https://www.cobbcounty.org/elections/voting/advance-voting" target="_blank">opened up Nov. 27</a> for early voting, and a smaller handful <a href="https://www.celebratedouglascounty.com/545/Advance-Voting" target="_blank">opened </a>it up for Nov. 22 and 23.<strong> </strong></p> <p class="">During the 2020 runoff election, many voters had a period of several weeks to vote early in person — and all had the possibility to do so on at least on one Saturday.</p> <p class="">Voting rights experts warn that SB 202’s restrictions on drop boxes will also affect the ease with which many absentee voters can drop off their ballots.</p> <p class="">The law says such drop boxes can be located only inside election offices, and early voting locations and are available only during the office or polling site's hours of operation.</p> <p class="">This year, these drop boxes will be available only during early in-person voting. In the counties that adhere to the minimum requirement — Monday to Friday the week before the election — those same limitations will also affect drop-box access. How the judiciary rules on the Nov. 26 issue would also be a factor here.</p> <p class="">“In 2020, if you had had an absentee ballot and were worried whether it would arrive at an election office on time, you could go drop of it off on a Saturday," said Rahul Garabadu, a senior voting rights attorney at the Georgia American Civil Liberties Union. "But now because of SB 202, you can only do that during the hours of early voting, which can often be a regular 9-to-5."</p> <p class="">As a result, he suggested, more people may choose to mail in their ballot instead — a fact that then brings into play any potential postal delays.</p> <p class="endmark">“All of these provisions interact with each other,” Garabadu said. “When they combine, you see a cumulative effect on voters, which makes it tougher to cast their ballots.”</p><p class="">A Fulton County judge ruled Friday that the Georgia Secretary of State cannot prohibit counties from voting on the Saturday after Thanksgiving, a victory for the state Democratic Party and Sen. Raphael Warnock’s campaign.</p> <p class="">The order comes after a brief legal battle between Secretary of State  Brad Raffensperger's office and the Democratic Party of Georgia over the Dec. 6 Senate runoff between Warnock and Republican Herschel Walker.</p> <p class="">Raffensperger, a Republican, had maintained that changes to Georgia voting laws meant that there could be no early voting on Nov. 26, the only Saturday when it would have been possible for Georgians to cast an early vote in the hotly contested race.</p> <p class="">Democrats and Warnock’s campaign filed suit challenging Raffensperger's determination, and Judge Thomas A. Cox agreed with their arguments in a ruling late Friday afternoon. “The Court finds that the absence of the Saturday vote will irreparably harm the Plaintiffs, their members, and constituents, and their preferred runoff candidate,” the judge wrote.</p> <p class="">Mike Hassinger, a spokesperson for Raffensperger's office, said "We disagree with the court’s order and look forward to a prompt appeal.” </p> <p class="">The attorney general’s office said it planned to appeal the ruling, spokesperson Kara Richardson said.</p> <p class="">The dispute centers on a provision of <a href="https://www.legis.ga.gov/api/legislation/document/20212022/201498">Senate Bill 202</a>, signed by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp in March 2021, which stipulates early in-person voting must end the Friday before the runoff. This year, that would be Friday, Dec. 2. </p> <p class="">The law also stipulates early in-person voting not be held on any Saturday that follows a “public or legal holiday” on the preceding Thursday or Friday. Raffensperger contended that meant there would be no early in-person voting on Nov. 26, the Saturday following Thanksgiving. (It could not be held this weekend because the general election vote is not being certified until Nov. 21.)  </p> <p class="">Attorneys for the Democrats and Warnock argued the section of the law Raffensperger cited applies to primaries and general elections, but not to runoffs. Cox agreed.</p> <p class="endmark">Voting rights groups have pushed counties in Georgia to open up early in-person voting on Nov. 22, 23 and 27. As of Friday, at least nine of the state’s 159 <a href="https://twitter.com/GabrielSterling/status/1593622135716470784" target="_blank">counties</a> had <a href="https://www.cobbcounty.org/elections/voting/advance-voting" target="_blank">opened up Nov. 27</a> for early voting, and a smaller handful <a href="https://www.celebratedouglascounty.com/545/Advance-Voting" target="_blank">opened </a>it up for Nov. 22 and 23.<strong> </strong></p><p class="">WASHINGTON — Former President Donald Trump will be the subject of a second special counsel investigation, this one focused on his handling of<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-employee-told-fbi-former-president-ordered-staff-move-boxes-docu-rcna52019"> classified documents found at his Mar-a-Lago home</a> and “key aspects” of the investigation into<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/justice-department-investigating-trumps-actions-part-jan-6-probe-rcna40167"> his role in the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol</a>, Attorney General Merrick Garland said Friday.</p> <p class="">“Based on recent developments, including Trump’s announcement that he is a candidate for president in the next election, and the current president’s intention to be a candidate in the next election, I have concluded it is in the public interest to appoint a special counsel,” Garland said at a news conference.</p> <p class="">Garland's decision to appoint a special counsel was first reported by the<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/garland-to-name-special-counsel-to-determine-whether-trump-should-face-charges-11668796152?mod=breakingnews"> Wall Street Journal</a>.</p> <p class="">Garland said that on Friday morning he signed a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1552896/download">letter</a> formally naming <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/jack-smith-special-counsel-investigating-donald-trump-rcna57944" target="_blank">John L. Smith</a>, known as Jack Smith, a prosecutor at The Hague and a former federal prosecutor, to begin serving as special counsel “immediately.” Smith was previously the chief of the Justice Department’s Public Integrity Section, where he oversaw public corruption and elections-related investigations.</p> <p class="">Smith is assigned with investigating whether anyone violated the law in connection with efforts to “interfere with the lawful transfer of power following the 2020 presidential election or the certification of the Electoral College vote held on or about January 6, 2021, as well as any matters that arose or might arise directly from this investigation.” The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia will continue <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/doj-says-needs-money-jan-6-probe-spending-bill-may-last-chance-rcna51767" target="_blank">investigating those individuals who stormed the U.S. Capitol</a>.</p> <p class="">Garland said that Smith will also have in his portfolio "the ongoing investigation involving classified documents and other presidential records" taken from Trump's White House "as well as the possible obstruction of that investigation.”</p> <p class="">In remarks at an event at his Florida resort Friday night, Trump called Smith's appointment “appalling” and a “horrendous abuse of power,” and referred to him as a "super radical left special counsel." </p> <p class="">“This is a rigged deal,” Trump said of the probes, complaining that he'd "been going through these hoaxes, investigations and scams since day one." </p> <p class="">"We are innocent," he added. </p> <p class="">Trump<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-announce-president-2024-rcna36987"> announced</a> his 2024 presidential campaign this week. Given that Garland was appointed by President Joe Biden, naming a special counsel would give Garland more distance from the investigation into Trump, who could be Biden’s rival if the president decides to run for re-election.</p> <p class="">“This is a totally expected political stunt by a feckless, politicized, weaponized Biden Department of Justice," a Trump campaign spokesman said in a statement.</p> <p class="">Following his appointment, Smith emphasized in a statement that he will conduct an "independent" investigation. "I will exercise independent judgement and will move the investigations forward expeditiously and thoroughly to whatever outcome the facts and the law dictate," he said.</p> <p class="">Trump was previously under investigation by former special counsel Robert Mueller, who<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/your-guide-mueller-s-report-trump-what-s-it-what-n995251"> issued his report in 2019</a> focusing on Russian interference in the 2020 election and Trump’s efforts to interfere with the Justice Department investigation.</p> <p class="">Garland said he was confident in the DOJ's ability to investigate Trump, but, "I also believe that appointing a special counsel at this time is the right thing to do. The extraordinary circumstances presented here demand it."</p> <p class="endmark">Garland added that he will ensure Smith “receives the resources to conduct this work quickly and completely.”</p><p class="">Iowa’s Republican Party chair wants to make it as difficult as possible for national Democrats to dethrone his state from its early perch in the presidential primary season, even if it means moving the state's caucuses up by several months. </p> <p class="">Iowa GOP Chair Jeff Kaufmann, who also heads the national GOP committee that oversees its presidential schedule, wants both parties in his state to hold their caucuses on the same day, even though there's no rule that mandates they do so. </p> <p class="">National Democrats <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/democrats-big-fight-state-goes-first-2024-presidential-primary-rcna57602" target="_blank">are pursuing an overhaul</a> to their primary schedule, including dropping Iowa amid complaints that it isn’t racially or ethnically diverse and has grown so red it isn’t worth the early investment. </p> <p class="">But if a different state were to move into Iowa’s slot for Democrats, Kaufmann said he will make sure he keeps jumping so Iowa’s Republican caucus goes first. </p> <p class="">“This is the Democrats that are pulling this crap and I’m telling you right now, they don’t want to play chicken with me. This is pure, progressive, power politics,” Kaufmann told NBC News Friday. Kaufmann’s position could complicate the overall schedule even more since New Hampshire has a law on the books that it has to hold its primary just after Iowa’s caucuses.</p> <p class="">“If, for some reason, California and New York dictate policy for the entire DNC and they give the middle finger to Iowa and the Midwest — if that happens, we will be first,” Kaufmann said. “I’ll move this thing to Halloween if that’s what it takes.”</p> <p class="">The caucuses are typically not scheduled until January or early February of the same year as the presidential race.</p> <p class="">Kaufmann also laid into President Biden’s agriculture secretary, Tom Vilsack, a onetime presidential contender and former Iowa governor, saying he and other Democratic leaders weren’t doing enough to preserve Iowa’s first place in line. Vilsack did not respond to a request for comment. Kaufmann argued it was detrimental to the entire system if Democrats pulled out of Iowa as a first-in-the-nation caucus since the two parties typically agree to hold their caucuses on the same day. </p> <p class="">Iowa’s Democratic Party Chair Ross Wilburn noted that even if Democrats put the state later, Republicans would still be campaigning in Iowa early<strong> </strong>and testing their messages to rural voters, putting Democrats at a disadvantage with that electorate if they abandon the smaller state.  </p> <p class="">“We can’t allow our presidential campaigns to be solely decided by campaigns that can only afford TV ads or by corporate special interest groups who have the funds to pay for their candidate to get exposure in larger media markets,” Wilburn said. “We believe we need to have small rural states like Iowa, in the mix.”</p> <p class="">The discussion comes after Democrats scrapped the old calendar and opened up the process so all states could apply to be early contenders. That old system began with the Iowa caucuses, then went to the New Hampshire primary, Nevada and South Carolina.  </p> <p class="">These early positions are prized since they create an economic bump in states that are flooded with advertising dollars and on-the-ground organizations.  </p> <p class="">Dozens of states have now applied to take one of the early state positions. They include all of the states that have previously gone early, while Nevada is attempting to replace New Hampshire as the first-in-the-nation primary. Both Minnesota and Michigan are making plays to move into a Midwestern slot should Iowa be dropped from the early rotation. </p> <p class="endmark">The Democratic National Committee’s rules and bylaws committee is scheduled to meet in early December in Washington to discuss the presidential primary schedule. </p><p class="">WASHINGTON — Former President Donald Trump lashed out Friday at the Department of Justice after Attorney General Merrick Garland announced he was <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/attorney-general-merrick-garland-names-special-counsel-justice-depts-t-rcna57920" target="_blank">appointing a special counsel</a> to oversee the investigations into Trump's handling of<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-employee-told-fbi-former-president-ordered-staff-move-boxes-docu-rcna52019"> classified documents found at his Mar-a-Lago home</a> and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/justice-department-investigating-trumps-actions-part-jan-6-probe-rcna40167">his role in the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol</a>.</p> <p class="">In remarks at his Florida resort Friday night, Trump called the appointment of special counsel Jack Smith "appalling" and a "horrendous abuse of power." "This is a rigged deal," he said, referring to Smith, a highly respected <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/jack-smith-special-counsel-investigating-donald-trump-rcna57944" target="_blank">career prosecutor</a>, as the "super radical left special counsel." </p> <p class="">“They want to do bad things to the greatest movement in the history of our country but in particular bad things to me,” he said. Echoing language from his speech before the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, he told attendees, “You people have to fight. You have to fight. You have to be strong.”  </p> <p class="">Trump acknowledged several Republican lawmakers apparently in the audience for the event, including Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi, Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Ronny Jackson and Louie Gohmert of Texas, Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, Clay Higgins of Louisiana, Claudia Tenney of New York, and failed Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake.  </p> <p class="">Trump noted that the announcement of a special counsel comes just days after <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-announce-president-2024-rcna36987" target="_blank">he announced a 2024 White House bid</a>, which Garland said was a factor in his decision to seek an independent prosecutor.</p> <p class="">“Based on recent developments, including Trump’s announcement that he is a candidate for president in the next election, and the current president’s intention to be a candidate in the next election, I have concluded it is in the public interest to appoint a special counsel,” Garland said at a news conference Friday.</p> <p class="">Republican allies of the former president denounced Garland's decision as a political move.</p> <p class="">"Has there ever been a more politicized and weaponized DOJ in American history?" <a href="https://twitter.com/RepAndyBiggsAZ/status/1593710728921456642" target="_blank">tweeted</a> Rep.

John Cornyn, R-Texas, <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnCornyn/status/1593698062895120394" target="_blank">tweeted</a> the appointment was "an admission of a conflict of interest by DOJ" and said that as a result, the department should "acknowledge the obvious conflict of interest in Hunter Biden investigation and appoint a special counsel."</p> <p class="">Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who has sometimes rebuked Trump, said in a statement that Garland's decision was "not good news for our country." He said he has experience with special prosecutors and independent counsels. </p> <p class="">"They take forever to investigate and make a decision. This means the issue will extend way into the 2024 election cycle. It will be a distraction," said Hutchinson, who has hinted at a 2024 presidential run himself.</p> <p class="">Garland named <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/jack-smith-special-counsel-investigating-donald-trump-rcna57944" target="_blank">John L. Smith</a>, known as Jack Smith, a prosecutor at The Hague and a former federal prosecutor, to begin serving as special counsel “immediately."  Smith was previously the chief of the Justice Department’s Public Integrity Section, where he oversaw public corruption and elections-related investigations.</p> <p class="">Smith is tasked with investigating whether anyone violated the law in connection with efforts to “interfere with the lawful transfer of power following the 2020 presidential election or the certification of the Electoral College vote held on or about January 6, 2021, as well as any matters that arose or might arise directly from this investigation.” The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia will continue <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/doj-says-needs-money-jan-6-probe-spending-bill-may-last-chance-rcna51767" target="_blank">investigating those individuals who stormed the U.S. Capitol</a>.</p> <p class="">Garland said that Smith will also have in his portfolio "the ongoing investigation involving classified documents and other presidential records" taken from Trump’s White House “as well as the possible obstruction of that investigation."</p> <p class="endmark">Smith said in a statement following the announcement that he will conduct an “independent” investigation and "will move the investigations forward expeditiously and thoroughly to whatever outcome the facts and the law dictate."</p><p class="">WASHINGTON — As winter temperatures arrive across America,  government officials are bracing for a surge of households unable to pay rising winter heating bills, and dwindling resources available to help cover the costs.</p> <p class="">For the average household, home heating costs are <a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/report/winterfuels.php#:~:text=The%20residential%20natural%20gas%20price,of%202022%20compared%20with%202021." target="_blank">projected</a> to rise <strong> </strong>28% — on top of double-digit increases last year — driven largely by the disruption to energy markets caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and surging demand for fossil fuels. At the same time, federally funded programs to help low-income households with those bills will have 42% less money this winter after the billions of dollars in Covid stimulus available last winter runs out. </p> <p class="">The surge in demand and drop in aid is causing concern throughout state and federal governments. In anticipation, the White House has taken a three-prong approach the past year, said an administration official: It has urged oil companies to bolster their stockpiles; make funds available to weatherize homes and make them more energy efficient; and prepare for further releases from the country's petroleum or heating oil reserves. </p> <p class="">But temperatures are already dropping and the number of households seeking assistance is already on the rise, according to interviews with more than a half dozen officials involved in programs that provide heating assistance. </p> <p class="">“We’re already seeing record numbers of requests this season for utility assistance and really the heating season is just beginning,” said Scott Kelly, general secretary of the Massachusetts division of the Salvation Army, an international charitable organization. “Our social workers are seeing people who have never needed to ask for help before, so it’s definitely concerning to us. We are very concerned about what the future will hold this heating season.”</p> <p class="">Americans are getting squeezed financially on a number of other fronts with inflation that has shown little signs of abating, and the end to a number of pandemic-era assistance programs, such as the emergency rental assistance funding and the child tax credit that provided hundreds of dollars a month to households before it expired last year. </p> <p class="">Kelly said the Salvation Army in Massachusetts has received twice as many applications as it did this time last year for its winter heating assistance program, which is aimed at those whose incomes are too high to qualify for federal assistance.</p> <p class="">One of those seeking help this winter is Malonie Bernard. She said her family has been struggling to pay its utility bills with a single income from her fiancé after she left her job at a nursing home during the pandemic to take care of her three children.  </p> <p class="">As the temperatures have dipped into the 20s at night in her hometown of Fitchburg, she has yet to turn on the gas heat in her apartment. </p> <p class="">Instead, her 9- and 12-year-old children sleep under multiple blankets in heavy pajamas and some nights she uses her body heat to keep her 11-month-old baby warm. She strategically uses space heaters, is sure to use the oven instead of the stove, and times her laundry so the dryer will help warm the house in the evening.</p> <p class="">Each month, Bernard says she has to juggle what bills to pay and what ones to delay as costs have kept rising. Over the summer her electric bill for her seven-room apartment shot up to $700 one month, it had previously never gone above $200, and she’s run up  an unpaid balance of about $1,000. For the winter, she’s anticipating her gas bill will be well above last winter’s of $600 a month — money her family doesn’t have in their budget. </p> <p class="">“It’s hard. It’s so hard asking for help, but at this point, we have no choice,” said Bernard. “We feel bad, as if we’re taking it from someone else who really, really needs it. So we try to push it, but I said this year, I don’t think we’re going to be able to push it.”</p> <p class="">In Colorado, the demand for assistance through the federally funded Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, know as LIHEAP, is expected to far outstrip the demand, said Theresa Kullen, who manages the program in Colorado. Kullen said she expects applications to be up 10% this winter on top of the 10% increase they saw last year. </p> <p class="">“We’re very concerned about how much we can do because we know it’s not enough, there’s just not enough money to do what we need to do,” said Kullen. “With the pandemic relief funds we were able to do so much good, and that money is now gone. And so we are taking a step backwards.”</p> <p class="">But many of those who apply this year will find far less help available to them now that pandemic-era programs have run dry. </p> <p class="">“If Congress doesn’t step in and find some way to help the bottom third of the population pay these bills you’ll see more suffering and they’ll just be poor instead of being working class, and that’s what they’re afraid of, working-class families are afraid of becoming poor,” said Mark Wolfe,  executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. “You no longer have what makes you feel lower middle class, you now feel poor, and that’s what’s happening across the board with these inflationary increases, and it’s subtle, it’s quiet.”</p> <p class="">Congress has allocated $4.8 billion for heating assistance this winter through the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which is $1 billion more than pre-pandemic funding levels. But that will be far less than the $8.3 billion available last year with the addition of Covid relief funds.</p> <p class="">Despite the extra assistance last year, 20 million households are already behind on their utility bills owing a total of $16 billion in overdue payments — an average of $800 per household, <a href="https://neada.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/20millionbehindPR.pdf">according to NEADA</a>. That’s up from $8 billion in utility bill debt at the start of the pandemic.</p> <p class="">Energy costs are on the rise for a range of reasons. Prices for natural gas, the most common form of winter heating in the U.S., are projected to rise 28% this winter, largely because of increased demand in Europe following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to the Energy Information Administration. </p> <p class="">The price of heating oil, which is widely used in New England, is expected to be up 27% this winter, and it will cost the average home $1,000 more this winter for heating oil than two years ago, <a href="https://neada.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/20millionbehindPR.pdf">according to NEADA</a>. Heating oil prices are linked to the price of crude oil, which has been increasing as a result of surging demand following the pandemic, limited refinery capacity and uncertainty in the markets from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</p> <p class="">In Maine, where the majority of households rely on heating oil, officials have seen a 10% uptick in applications so far this year for its heating assistance program that provided help to 40,000 households last year. Without the Covid stimulus money this year, Maine will provide benefits to around the same number of households, but the amount they receive will be about half of last year’s benefit, said Scott Thistle, a spokesman for MaineHousing. </p> <p class="">“Last winter, we were able to provide about a tank and a half of heating benefit. This year, we’re going to be able to provide them with less than a tank. Maybe if we’re lucky, depending on the price of oil, we’ll get two-thirds or a half a tank so it just doesn’t go as far,” said Thistle. </p> <p class="">The cost of heating oil has been a particular concern for the Biden administration, said the government official. Biden and Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm have been urging oil companies to cut exports of diesel, which is chemically the same as heating oil, to keep more in the U.S. to build up stockpiles in the Northeast in case there are supply disruptions or colder-than-expected weather that leads to a surge in demand. </p> <p class="">Heating oil and diesel inventories are at their lowest levels on record for this time of year. </p> <p class="">The administration is also prepared to tap into the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve, which has about 1 million barrels of heating oil, if necessary, the administration officials said.</p> <p class="">The White House announced earlier this month it was also distributing $9 billion from the Inflation Reduction Act passed earlier this year to help 1.6 million households upgrade their homes to lower energy bills, like providing rebates to purchase a new electric stove, install new insulation or energy efficient appliances. The administration is also distributing $3.16 billion from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to retrofit thousands of low-incomes homes to make them more energy efficient while lowering utility bills, including installing insulation and updating heating and cooling systems.</p> <p class="endmark">Longer term, the Biden administration is looking for ways to expand heat pump use and manufacturing in the U.S. and develop programs to improve building energy efficiency, according to an announcement earlier this month. </p><p class="">President Donald Trump is boxing his own shadow as he seeks the Republican presidential nomination — and that’s not likely to change anytime soon.</p> <p class="">There’s little incentive for rivals to join him in the ring, according to advisers to potential candidates and other Republican strategists.</p> <p class="">From the front row, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is collecting support from<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/11/06/gop-megadonor-desantis-24-ken-griffin-00065274"> prominent donors</a> and<a href="https://www.fox4news.com/news/poll-desantis-trump-texas"> beating Trump</a> in some polls of<a href="https://www.clubforgrowth.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/CfGAction_2024_Primary_PollSummary_221114.pdf"> key states</a>. If he runs, that announcement isn’t expected to come until summer at the earliest — probably after Florida’s legislative session ends in June — which will give him time to gauge his own chances.</p> <p class="">“He’s not in a hurry because he doesn’t have to be. And he has a day job: governor,” said one top Florida Republican who was in regular contact with DeSantis throughout his 2022 re-election campaign and spoke anonymously to relay how he believes DeSantis is thinking.</p> <p class="">Dan Eberhart, a Republican fundraiser who once backed Trump but now wants DeSantis to be the party’s nominee in 2024, said there's time.</p> <p class="">“If Trump is going to be in, I would like for him not to be the only national Republican candidate out there,” Eberhart said. “But DeSantis isn’t going to get in until after the Florida legislative session ends, at least. Anyone that gets in now runs the risk of peaking too early.”</p> <p class="">The two-part early conclusion drawn by many GOP insiders is that the only way to beat Trump is by unifying around a single alternative and that DeSantis is the best of the rest.</p> <p class="">That’s why the timing calculations are a bit more complicated for the lower-polling candidates, who also have to worry that the race quickly becomes a clash of titans between Trump and DeSantis with little available space for also-rans. The questions of whether and when to jump in are inexorably linked, as windows of opportunity can open and close at a moment’s notice.</p> <p class="">Trump’s early announcement for president — which he almost made before the midterm elections last week — followed nearly two years of planning, fundraising and speeches. His interest in announcing a presidential bid intensified last year when President Joe Biden’s approval ratings dropped amid the souring economy and chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan. </p> <p class="">Aides say his desire to run became even more earnest as he increasingly saw DeSantis as a threat and, then, as the Department of Justice opened two separate criminal investigations into him over his role in the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol and his possession and storage of sensitive documents that the federal government says he improperly handled in his post-presidency.</p> <p class="">But others aren’t feeling Trump’s urgency.</p> <p class="">Since Trump’s Tuesday speech, there have been more signs of movement in the invisible primary — the behind-the-scenes battle to line up donors, endorsers and top staff — than a rush to launch.</p> <p class="">“People are either waiting or scrambling to get as close to DeSantis’ inner circle as possible — or they’re with Trump,” Eberhart said of the donor class.</p> <p class="">In the world of GOP elites, the field is quickly narrowing to Trump and DeSantis, and the Florida Republican source said there is something unique about their rivalry.</p> <p class="">“The fact is Ron is different from any other Republican who might run against Trump,” the Republican said. “Ron is in Trump’s head. The other guys aren’t. Ron made a red wave in the state when it didn’t materialize really anywhere else. He won by a historic margin. And billionaires are basically begging him to run.”</p> <p class="">In addition to the celebrity from his big re-election win of nearly 20 points, DeSantis has an edge over some of the other possible non-Trump candidates: money. His political and campaign committees had at least $64 million in the bank, according to the most recent campaign finance data.</p> <p class="">DeSantis continued to fundraise after the election but has no immediately known plans to convert the state political committee into a federal super PAC that could support his federal candidacy.</p> <p class="">Florida also has a so-called resign to run law that would require DeSantis, if he qualifies to run for president, to resign as governor after the 2024 election — whether or not he wins the presidency. Legislative allies are expected to change the law during the spring lawmaking session but they’re “waiting on smoke signals from the Plaza Level,” said a knowledgeable legislative source referring to the Tallahassee shorthand for the location of the governor’s office on the first floor of the state Capitol.</p> <p class="">One reason for the other hopefuls to wait outside the ring is the hope that Trump and DeSantis bloody each other badly enough to turn the title fight into a battle royal.   </p> <p class="">Former Vice President Mike Pence, who needs no introduction to voters, is on a book tour. In fact, his book came out on the same day as Trump’s big announcement. He didn’t watch Trump’s launch speech Tuesday, according to an aide, and has said he could wait until the spring to announce whether he will run.</p> <p class="">Like DeSantis, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin is expected to keep his focus on state matters, possibly until Virginia’s legislative session ends in February. </p> <p class="">But Youngkin maintained a robust schedule on behalf of Republican candidates in the midterms, earning chits in key states, and he has a growing list of prominent GOP donors ready to back him should he join the race. </p> <p class="">Trump appears to have noticed, targeting the governor with <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/donald-trump-blasts-out-racist-attack-on-virginia-gov-glenn-youngkin">a racist, somewhat confusing, attack</a> on his social media platform. </p> <p class="">South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, long viewed as having eyes on the presidency, made critical remarks of Trump on Wednesday in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/16/us/politics/trump-republicans-alternatives.html" target="_blank">The New York Times</a>. But in a <a href="https://rumble.com/v1v70qu-sd-governor-kristi-noem-republicans-must-embrace-the-ideals-and-history-tha.html" target="_blank">"War Room" podcast</a> interview on Thursday with former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, she walked back the remarks and issued a mild criticism of DeSantis for briefly locking down Florida during spring break when the Covid pandemic first hit in 2020.</p> <p class="">The better known a potential candidate is, the longer he or she can afford to wait. It takes more time and money for more obscure hopefuls to become familiar to voters. The GOP primary electorate is familiar with Trump and Pence from their time in the White House, and, to a lesser extent, DeSantis and even Youngkin a bit from their recent high-profile gubernatorial wins.</p> <p class="">The Pence aide says there’s no concern in his camp that anti-Trump donors will all flock to DeSantis.</p> <p class="">“I think that the donor base is so large that that is not a threat; I don’t think there could be that level of consolidation,” the Pence aide said, pointing to loyalty among the former vice president’s contributors that transcends pure political calculation. “There are elements of the donor base that I think he appeals to because of his faith and his devotion in that faith that other candidates don’t really appeal to.”</p> <p class="">But would-be candidates who haven’t been in the political arena as recently — former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie among them — may have to make their decisions a little more quickly. Few are tipping their hands now.</p> <p class="">“The secretary hasn’t made a final decision about whether or not he will run,” a person close to Pompeo said. “But that decision will be based on if he thinks it is the best place for him to serve and if the timing is correct.”</p> <p class="">Christie is <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/11/15/chris-christie-trump-governors">clearly eager to hammer Trump</a>, but it’s not clear whether that will be as a candidate or perhaps as a commentator on television. He is “open to” a run, said longtime adviser Mike DuHaime, who added that Christie will not jump in “unless he sees a path” to the nomination. Either way, DuHaime said, Trump’s entry has no effect on Christie’s thinking and no decision is imminent.</p> <p class="">Trump’s team has long held the position that he’s expecting other Republicans to run against him and that, if a critical number of primary challengers line up, it would make his candidacy even more formidable.</p> <p class="">“We have at least 30% of the Republican primary electorate that will do anything to support the [former] president. And the value of their votes becomes proportionately higher if a bunch of others pile in the race and dilute the not-Trump vote and divide it up between them,” said one Trump strategist who spoke anonymously to share the campaign’s thinking.</p> <p class="">In the days since Trump’s launch, his campaign has released a string of endorsements from lawmakers. But the number is much lower than the set that he endorsed in the recent midterm elections, and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., dodged this week when he was asked whether he backs Trump for president.</p> <p class="">Steven Cheung, the communications director for Trump’s campaign, said that the former president believes “America is in decline due to the weak leadership of Joe Biden,” adding that “there are others who will be bound to the political establishment, be beholden to corporations and drag the United States into more unnecessary wars.”</p> <p class="">Brad Todd, a veteran Republican strategist, said it makes more sense for hopefuls to take their time for a variety of logistical reasons, including federal fundraising limits that are imposed once a candidacy becomes official. But more than that, he said, Republican voters are exhausted.</p> <p class="">“Campaigns have gotten bigger and rougher and louder, and I think voters reach a capacity when they need a break,” Todd said. “My advice for anyone running for anything in 2024 right now would be let the voters have their holiday.”</p> <p class="">One GOP strategist who worked for Trump in the past said that DeSantis would be smart to stay out and let the former president see how much his own support has dissipated even without a big rival in the race.</p> <p class="endmark">“If he’s not in, it will just drive Trump crazy,” the strategist said. “You’re going to have all these donors, all these folks waiting for DeSantis and that’s going to be their answer [when Trump asks for help]. And that’s just going to twist the knife.” </p>
