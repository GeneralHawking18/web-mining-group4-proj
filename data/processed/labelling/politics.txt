WASHINGTON — Former President Donald Trump lashed out Friday at the Department of Justice after Attorney General Merrick Garland announced he was appointing a special counse to oversee the investigations into Trump's handling o classified documents found at his Mar-a-Lago hom and his role in the Jan
6 attack on the Capito In remarks at his Florida resort Friday night, Trump called the appointment of special counsel Jack Smith appalling and a horrendous abuse of power
This is a rigged deal, he said, referring to Smith, a highly respected career prosecuto , as the super radical left special counsel
They want to do bad things to the greatest movement in the history of our country but in particular bad things to me, he said
Echoing language from his speech before the Jan
6 riot at the US
Capitol, he told attendees, You people have to fight.  You have to fight
You have to be strong
Trump acknowledged several Republican lawmakers apparently in the audience for the event, including Sen
Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi, Reps
Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Ronny Jackson and Louie Gohmert of Texas, Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, Clay Higgins of Louisiana, Claudia Tenney of New York, and failed Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake
Trump noted that the announcement of a special counsel comes just days after he announced a 2024 White House bi , which Garland said was a factor in his decision to seek an independent prosecutor Based on recent developments, including Trump’s announcement that he is a candidate for president in the next election, and the current president’s intention to be a candidate in the next election, I have concluded it is in the public interest to appoint a special counsel, Garland said at a news conference Friday Republican allies of the former president denounced Garland's decision as a political move Has there ever been a more politicized and weaponized DOJ in American history? tweete Rep
Andy Biggs, R-Ariz, who challenged House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif, for their conference vote this week for speaker and lost Sen
Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who ran against Trump in the 2016 GOP presidential primary, said President Joe Biden has completely weaponized the Department of Justice to attack his political opponents
This is Trump derangement syndrome but this time with a gun and badge.  #JusticeCorrupte , Cruz tweeted
Greene, R-Ga, tweeted, IMPEACH MERRICK GARLAND! In a follow-up twee , Greene said Republicans will need to refuse to appropriate any funding to Merrick Garland’s Special Counsel and defund any part of the DOJ acting on behalf of the Democrat party as a taxpayer funded campaign arm for the Democrat’s 2024 presidential nominee Sen
John Cornyn, R-Texas, tweete the appointment was an admission of a conflict of interest by DOJ and said that as a result, the department should acknowledge the obvious conflict of interest in Hunter Biden investigation and appoint a special counsel.  Arkansas Gov
Asa Hutchinson, who has sometimes rebuked Trump, said in a statement that Garland's decision was not good news for our country
He said he has experience with special prosecutors and independent counsels
They take forever to investigate and make a decision
This means the issue will extend way into the 2024 election cycle
It will be a distraction, said Hutchinson, who has hinted at a 2024 presidential run himself Garland named John L
Smit , known as Jack Smith, a prosecutor at The Hague and a former federal prosecutor, to begin serving as special counsel immediately
Smith was previously the chief of the Justice Department’s Public Integrity Section, where he oversaw public corruption and elections-related investigations Smith is tasked with investigating whether anyone violated the law in connection with efforts to interfere with the lawful transfer of power following the 2020 presidential election or the certification of the Electoral College vote held on or about January 6, 2021, as well as any matters that arose or might arise directly from this investigation.  The US
Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia will continue investigating those individuals who stormed the US
Capito Garland said that Smith will also have in his portfolio the ongoing investigation involving classified documents and other presidential records taken from Trump’s White House as well as the possible obstruction of that investigation
Smith said in a statement following the announcement that he will conduct an independent investigation and will move the investigations forward expeditiously and thoroughly to whatever outcome the facts and the law dictate.
After winning re-election to her seat in the House, Rep
Norma Torres, D-Calif, issued a news releas making a startling accusation: El Salvador President Nayib Bukele participated in foreign election interference in her race Bukele, whose government has said it’s Torres who has been interfering in its matters, urged residents of California’s 35th District to vote against Torres in tweet last yea
In the months leading to this year’s midterm elections, legislators from Bukele’s party openly supported her opponent on social media Let’s say no to Norma Torres because she has caused so much harm to El Salvador, one of the many tweet read Torres told NBC News that members of Bukele’s government openly supported her opponent in rallies and social media posts, and she said she was harassed in person and online with hateful and racist messages The State Department considers it an attempt to influence the elections Throughout our last electoral process, we noted with alarm increasingly direct attempts by some Salvadorans to directly influence certain electoral outcomes in the United States, a State Department spokesperson said in an email
As we have repeatedly made clear, this is unacceptable, and we have repeatedly communicated this directly to the Government of El Salvador through official diplomatic channels The integrity of our elections is a vital part of our democratic processes; the will of the people must not be undermined by foreign influence, the spokesperson said Asked about the legislators’ tweets against Torres, Milena Mayorga, the Salvadoran ambassador to the US, said she couldn't comment on their actions because they represent a different branch of the government
But she said it was Torres who interfered in El Salvador by criticizing Bukele in Salvadoran media outlet during the months leading up to the country’s February 2021 legislative elections
Torres disputes the allegation Bukele’s party, Nuevas Ideas, or New Ideas, and its allies went on to win the biggest congressional majority in El Salvador’s history
Richard Hasen, an expert in election law and professor at UCLA, said there is a difference between a foreign person’s trying to influence the outcome of an election and breaking US
law, which requires spending money There’s a technical difference
You can say someone is interfering with the election; you can call it election interference
I think that’s a fair thing to say, he said
But calling something election interference doesn’t mean it’s illegal election activity, which would require making campaign contributions or spending money to promote or oppose a candidate for federal office
The Justice Department declined to comment on whether any election laws were broken Torres’ release said she was disappointed in the lack of enforcement in our judicial system to address foreign interference, saying she was the subject of many threats, falsehoods, and harassment, both in-person and online, which she reiterated in a recent interview
The fact that the ambassador still sits at her residence here in the US
and has not been thrown out of the country, the fact that the consul generals have not been removed from our country, I think is a telling story where the disconnect is, said Torres, who immigrated to the US
from Guatemala when she was 5 Torres, who has been in office since 2015, won with 57. 4% of the vote
Her opponent, Republican Mike Cargile, got 42
6% of the vote, according t NBC News election result
It was the best performance in recent history for a Republican candidate in the district, once held by Democratic Rep
Maxine Waters, which has since been redrawn
The district is nearly 70% Hispanic and has a large Mexican American  population
Torres chairs the Congressional Central America Caucus, which she co-founded during her first year in Congress Bukele, a millennial populist leader, is popular in El Salvador and among many in diaspora communities, but critics say his government has taken authoritarian measures.  The US
denounced the Salvadoran Supreme Court’s decision last year that cleared the way for Bukele to run for a second consecutive term, saying it undermines democrac
Rights group say authorities have committed human rights abuses, which have resulted in arbitrary arrests and deaths in custody, after a heavy crackdown on gangs following a spike in murders in March
Mayorga said that ahead of El Salvador’s legislative elections, Torres spread false information by saying Bukele had come to Washington to meet with administration officials
Citing unnamed sources, The Associated Press reported at the tim that President Joe Biden turned down a meeting request with Bukele We never asked for a meeting with the Biden administration, Mayorga said
Instead, she said, Bukele came to meet with the general secretary of the Organization of American States to ask for election observers ahead of the Salvadoran elections
Mayorga said Bukele’s government didn’t say anything at the time, but more recently it has used diplomatic channels to complain about Torres Bukele and Torres met once in 2019 when she was with a congressional delegation visiting El Salvador
Animosity between the two appears to have started after a spat on Twitter last year After smugglers dropped two toddler sisters from a 14-foot wall at the US
-Mexico border, Torres accused the governments of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador in a twee of not doing enough to combat corruption and the narco
The two girls were from Ecuador, not from any of the countries Torres mentioned
After a back-and-forth between the two Torres referred to Bukele as a narcissistic dictato , and he countered with a twee urging voters from her district not to vote for her: She doesn’t work for you but rather to maintain all our countries underdeveloped
Torres said that she was flooded with hateful messages, including violent images and videos, and that her husband was harassed outside their house, so she began keeping a gun at her hom last year This weapon stays very close to me when I’m home, she said in an interview It’s not the first time politicians in Latin America have taken sides in US.  elections and vice versa
It’s the transnationalization of US
politics, said Eduardo Gamarra, a political science professor at Florida International University
American elections are followed with an enormous amount of detail in every country in the world
Issues such as remittances and immigration are domestic for the US, but they’re transnational for Salvadorans, he said In 2020, conservative Colombian senators endorse then-President Donald Trump and Rep
Maria Elvira Salazar, R-Fla, on social media
Gustavo Petr , who is now the president of Colombia, said in 2020 when he was a senator that if he could, he would vote for Biden Members of Congress have also taken sides in elections in Latin America
South Florida members of Congress voiced their concerns about Petro, a leftist, when he was running for office, calling him a thief and a terrorist
Gamarra said that as diaspora communities in the US
grow, there will be more attempts to influence elections here They understand that whoever goes to Congress has an influence in American foreign policy, he said
I think the reality is that we’re going to be seeing a lot of this going forward, especially with large diaspora communities that have ties back home.
NEW YORK — A decade after its last election autopsy, the Republican National Committee is moving forward with a new post-election audit designed to examine the GOP’s underwhelming performance in the recent midterm and the party’s broader struggles in the years since former President Donald Trum took power The report, which will likely take several months to complete, is expected to explore internal concerns about candidate quality, the lack of a clear governing agenda and the party’s unwillingness to embrace early voting, among other issues
There is some disagreement about the exact focus and scope of the upcoming review, but committee members involved in the planning suggest it will not shy away from difficult topics — including Trump’s intense focus on conspiracy theories We need to figure out what worked and what didn’t work in the ’22 cycle to make sure we put ourselves in the best position to win in ’24
I think there’s a lot to learn from, said RNC committeeman Henry Barbour, of Mississippi, whom RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel tapped to co-chair the review The decision to entertain such an undertaking represents a rare moment of public introspection from a Republican Party that has defiantly resisted any and all calls to change course during the Trump era
Indeed, for the last six years, the GOP has been almost singularly focused on its devotion to Trump and his priorities, even as electoral losses mounted in 2018 and 2020
The party’s disappointing midterm results earlier in the month marked a breaking point of sorts for some committee members, who are now more open to change Ten years have passed since the RNC last commissioned a post-election audit
The Growth and Opportunity Project of 2013 ultimately called on Republicans to adopt a more inclusive and welcoming tone, while embracing a more forgiving position on immigration Trump embodied everything the report advocated against when he emerged in 2015
Yet his surprising White House victory convinced party leaders to ignore their own recommendations — at least for a time McDaniel is initiating the post-2022 review as she faces a serious reelection test of her own within the committee, which she has led since Trump took office in 2016
In a corresponding move designed to demonstrate her political strength, McDaniel on Tuesday also announced the creation of an informal advisory council made up of a collection of 2022 candidates — some successful and some not — and prominent Republican operatives, including former Trump counselor Kellyanne Conwa The advisory council is not expected to have any bearing on the review, which follows pressure on McDaniel to acknowledge a problem within her party
Some RNC members were particularly concerned after she offered a rosy assessment of the GOP’s performance during a conference call the day after the midterms Republicans won a narrow House majority, falling far short of expectations, and failed to win the Senate majority
That’s even as Democrats faced historically bad political headwinds I must say that your remarks on the call this afternoon were disappointing and showed incredible unwillingness to face the reality of what happened last evening
I’ve heard from many members today who feel the same and want a real, honest assessment of what happened, RNC member Bill Palatucci, of New Jersey, wrote in a private email to McDaniel obtained by The Associated Press We have to face the fact that most of our candidates and the party in general underperformed by any objective measure, Palatucci continued
I wish you well but being unwilling to address the reality of the situation does no one any good
Trump’s allies are expected to play an active role in the upcoming review McDaniel has tapped Harmeet Dhillon, a Trump attorney and committeewoman from California, to serve as the other co-chair
Former Trump campaign manager David Bossie, an RNC member from Maryland, is also likely to be involved Trump loyalists have played an increasingly large role within the RNC, which consists of elected officials from all 50 states and a central staff in Washington
Those openly critical of Trump have largely been forced out in recent years Now, McDaniel is tasked with maintaining unity within her party as a growing number of GOP leaders push back against Trump’s influence Several Republican presidential prospects are openly preparing to challenge Trump’s bid for the 2024 presidential nomination
In recent days, some of them, including former Vice President Mike Pence, have condemned Trump’s recent private meeting with white supremacist and antisemite Nick Fuentes Despite an apparent shift in the party, those working on the new review are acutely aware that their final report cannot alienate Trump or his base, viewed as a critical piece of the Republican coalition It is a delicate balance, especially as Democrats work to avoid such divisions of their own heading into the next presidential election Democrats are unified — on how to divide America, said Conway, the former Trump counselor
Republicans must be unified — on how best to help a broken nation.
and Eric Trump did not discipline Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselber after finding out he'd been cheating on his taxes — and later gave him a raise to make up for the shortfall, the ex-CFO testified Friday Weisselberg, 75, testified for a third and final day in the criminal trial of Trump's family busines in New York City that the Trump brothers found out in 2017 that he had been getting off-the-books perks and bonuses paid as an independent contractor
At the time, he said, the company was cleaning up its business practices because of the extra scrutiny it got after its longtime head, Donald Trump, was elected president of the United States
Trump's eldest sons took over control of the company following the 2016 presidential election
Following that cleanup were you demoted or disciplined? prosecutor Susan Hoffinger asked.  Weisselberg replied, No
The company's chief operating officer, Matthew Calamari, had also been getting bonuses paid as an independent contractor and was not disciplined either, Weisselberg said Weisselberg acknowledged that he'd used the fact that he was no longer getting perks, like a free apartment and car, to successfully argue for a raise from the Trump brothers, who he'd known since they were children
He said he was given a $200,000 raise in 2019 I told them since the practice was no longer going on I would need some additional income to pay for those expenses, he said Asked if the brothers had filled their in father on what had happened, he said, I don’t know what they told their dad
Weisselberg, the prosecution’s star witness, was indicted along with the Trump Organization in April of last year in what the government described as a 15-year tax fraud scheme He pleaded guilt in August and agreed to testify truthfully against his employer in return for a five month jail sentence
Had he been convicted at trial, he could have faced a sentence of five to 15 years in prison On the witness stand, Weisselberg often seemed to be walking a tightrope between honoring his deal with prosecutors while offering only muted criticisms of his longtime employers While the company profited from his scams by not having to pay payroll or Medicare taxes, he testified under questioning from Trump lawyers Thursday that it was his own personal greed that led to this
Pressed by prosecutors on Friday, he said, There was some benefits to the company but primarily it was due to my greed
Weisselberg had also testified Thursday, in his second day on the stand, that the Trumps had not been aware of his schemes or given him permission to commit tax fraud when it was taking place, and that he had betrayed the family's trust in him On Friday, he acknowledged the company kept paying him his $1 million even after he was charged in the case and pleaded guilty, and that the company was paying for the lawyers who've represented him in this case as well These are some of the best lawyers in New York City, aren’t they? Hoffinger asked I hope so! Weisselberg answered
The former president, meanwhile, sounded off on the case on social media Friday There has never been a 'Fringe Benefits' case such as this brought before
Did a long time executive pay tax on the use of a company car, or a company apartment, or payments (not even taken by us as a tax deduction!) for the education of his grandchildren? For this, he gets handcuffs and jail? Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform.  VERY UNFAIR!
Officials in Arizona's largest county are blaming prominent Republicans for sowing doubt about a secure alternative for voters who encountered malfunctioning vote tabulation machine on Election Day Maricopa County issued a repor on the voting glitches Sunday, a day before it is set certify the results of the November election and a week after the state's Republican attorney general's office demanded answers on widespread voting machine glitches on Election Day
Some GOP politicians and pundits swiftly seized o those issues to push misleading or false informatio
In its report, the county said a root cause analysis of printer issues that prevented some vote tabulators from accepting ballots on Election Day remains underway, but noted that all printers had updated firmware, were installed with uniform settings, and used the same settings that were used in prior elections
The report noted that voters were instructed to put their ballots in a secure ballot box — termed a Door 3 option — if tabulators could not read them, a decades-long practice in the county
But despite it being a legal, secure and reliable voting option, many high-profile and influential individuals instructed voters to not deposit their ballots in Door 3
Consequently, some voters refused to use this viable voting option, the report said In a letter accompanying the repor , Tom Liddy, a Republican and head of Maricopa County’s civil division, said that eight other counties rely on secure boxes in elections because they do not have any tabulators in their polling locations at all, and their ballots are instead taken to a centralized location to be tabulated in every election It cannot be the case that the limited use of the Door 3 ballot box for some voters in Maricopa County violates the Constitution, while the required use of a ballot box by every voter in over half of the state’s counties does not, Liddy wrote in response to the attorney general's office Election officials at the time of the malfunction urged voters at polling sites where machines had malfunctioned to exercise other options, including either dropping their ballots in a secure box to be counted later in the day or going to another location to vote Kari Lake, the GOP candidate for Arizona governor endorsed by former President Donald Trump, and state GOP Chairwoman Kelli Ward were among several prominent Twitter users who sowed doubt on the platform about the election process following reports of the glitches
Lake, who los to Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, attacked Maricopa County officials over both the technical issues on Election Day and the prolonged vote count Last week, Maricopa County confirmed that Bill Gates, the chairman of the county’s board of supervisors, had been moved to an undisclosed location for his safety following threats on social media related to the midterm elections
County Sheriff Paul Penzone told reporters that he’d recommended Gates and his family go to a safe location for one night because of the threats Penzone, a Democrat, called on political leaders to be more responsible There’s a lot of candidates who say things they shouldn’t, including people who politically maybe didn’t see the outcomes they were hoping for, he said
Have some courage and speak out and say these types of threats aren’t OK against our opponents any more than they would be against us.
Mary Peltola has won a full two-year term representing Alaska in the US
House, NBC News projected Wednesday, defeating former governor and GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin
Peltola made history in Augus when she became the first Alaska Native seated in Congress after she won the special election to replace longtime GOP Rep
Don Young, who died in Marc at the age of 88
Shortly after news broke that she had won a full term on Wednesday night, Peltola tweete WE DID IT!!! The outcome of the Nov
8 election for the state's at-large House seat — as well as other contests, including for Senate  — had been delayed for weeks because of Alaska’s new ranked-choice voting system in which voters rank the candidates in order of preference After the first round of voting, Peltola led Palin by more than 20 percentage points with Republican Nick Begich, a scion of one of Alaska’s most well-known political families, in third
But because Peltola failed to win more than 50%, the voting went to a second round, with Begich eliminated and his votes redistributed to those voters’ second choice Begich and Palin also competed in the August special election, making this contest a three-way rematch Peltola’s victory is a blow to GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy and the Republicans, who were handed a razor-thin majority in this month’s midterm election
It means that a Democrat will hold the at-large House seat for the next two years, after Young and the GOP had controlled it for nearly five decades Young took over the seat in 1973 after Democratic Rep
Nick Begich, the grandfather of this year’s candidate by the same name, was presumed to have been killed in a plane crash Even before the race had been called, Palin, the late Sen
John McCain’s running mate in the 2008 presidential election, announced that she was the first person to sig a new ballot initiative to repeal Alaska’s ranked-choice voting system In the Senate contest, incumbent Republican Lisa Murkowski was re-elected Wednesda after ranked-choice runoff rounds, fending off a GOP challenger backed by former President Donald Trump
WASHINGTON — The Biden administration on Friday asked the Supreme Court to reinstate President Joe Biden’s student loan forgiveness pla , which has been blocked by a federal appeals court Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar in court papers urged the justices to lift an injunction imposed by the St.  Louis-based 8th US
Circuit Court of Appeal on Monday
Separately, a federal judge in Texas in a different case has also blocked the plan
The government has also asked the New Orleans-based 5th US
Circuit Court of Appeals to lift that injunction In the new filing, Prelogar said that the 8th Circuit's decision leaves millions of economically vulnerable borrowers in limbo, uncertain about the size of their debt and unable to make financial decisions with an accurate understanding of their future repayment obligations
Various individuals and groups have challenged the proposal, with the case now at the Supreme Court involving claims brought by six state : Nebraska, Missouri, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas and South Carolina
The Supreme Court on Friday asked the states to respond to Prelogar's request by noon on Wednesday, indicating the justices will not act before then The court could grant or deny the government's application or, as it has done in some other cases, agree to hear oral arguments on an expedited basis and issue a more detailed ruling A federal judge had ruled that the states did not have legal standing, but the appeals court disagreed, focusing on a Missouri agency that services federal student loans
The state argues that the agency would lose revenue if loans are forgiven A major obstacle facing those challenging the program is that they have to show they have legal standing to sue by illustrating how they are harmed by the program
Justice Amy Coney Barrett previously rejected two earlier challenge to the plan, both of which arose from cases in which lower courts said challengers didn’t have standing to bring their claims If the Supreme Court was to conclude that the states do have standing and then reach the legal question of whether Biden had the authority to forgive the loans, the administration is likely to face an uphill battle with the court’s conservative majority skeptical of broad assertions of federal power
The court in January, for example, blocke Biden's COVID-19 vaccine or test requirement for larger businesses The program, which allows eligible borrowers to cancel up to $20,000 of debt, has been blocked since the appeals court issued a temporary hold last mont
The administration has since closed the application process
Under a different Covid-related presidential order, borrowers do not currently have to make payments The challengers argue that the administration’s plan — announced by Biden in Augus and originally set to take effect this fall — violates the Constitution and federal law, partly because it circumvents Congress, which they said has the power to create laws related to student loan forgiveness Biden’s student debt relief program would provid up to $10,000 in debt cancellatio for borrowers earning less than $125,000 a year (or couples who file taxes jointly and earn less than $250,000 annually)
Pell Grant recipients, who comprise the majority of borrowers, would be eligible for an additional $10,000 in debt relief
The overall program is anticipated to help more than 40 million borrower , the administration has said The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated in September that Biden’s plan would cost $400 billio , while the Education Department said the price tag would be closer to $379 billio
Billionaire Elon Mus said on Friday he would support Ron DeSanti in 2024 if the Florida governor, who recently coasted to a second term, were to run for president DeSantis earlier this month defeated Democratic opponent Charlie Crist by nearly 20 percentage points to be re-elected as Florida governor and cemented himself as the Republican Party’s top rising star Political pundits have been doling out high marks to DeSantis, who is seen as a potential challenger to former President Donald Trum in the 2024 field of Republican presidential candidates
Trump announced 10 days ago he was running for electio again in 2024 My preference for the 2024 presidency is someone sensible and centrist
I had hoped that would the case for the Biden administration, but have been disappointed so far, Musk said on Twitter Yes, he replied in a tweet when asked if he would support DeSantis in 2024 As a reminder, I was a significant supporter of the Obama-Biden presidency and (reluctantly) voted for Biden over Trump, the Twitter owner said Musk had previously said in June he was leaning towards supporting DeSantis for president in 2024, and added the Florida governor would easily defeat Biden in the election When asked back then about Musk’s support, DeSantis joked, I welcome support from African-Americans, what can I say
Musk, who is white, grew up in South Afric DeSantis is especially popular with conservatives for taking the lead on culture war issues concerning race and gender
His governorship has been marked by his rejection of pandemic-related health restriction , passage of a law limiting discussion of LGBTQ issues in schools, and a feud with Walt Disne over the law Musk urged Americans to elect a Republican Congress in the midterm election earlier this month to counterbalance Biden’s Democrats
However, the Democrats defied Republican hopes for a red wave in the midterms and retained control of the Senate while the Republicans only won a narrow majority in the House of Representatives
WASHINGTON — Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s announcement Thursday that she is stepping dow after two decades leading House Democrats represents the generational chang that younger rank-and-file members had been demanding for years For me, the hour has come for a new generation to lead the Democratic Caucus that I so deeply respect, Pelosi, 82, said in her floor speech Her top lieutenant, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland, followed suit, saying he also would not run for leadership in the new Congress But Majority Whip Jim Clyburn of South Carolina apparently didn’t get the memo The most powerful Black lawmaker and a close ally of President Joe Biden, Clyburn said Friday he is running to stay in leadership in the No
4 spot as assistant minority leader, rather than bow out or accept an emeritus or other ceremonial role Clyburn’s decision will keep him at the leadership table and has scrambled the calculus for some younger, ambitious leaders, disrupting party unity at a time when Democrats are celebrating better-than-expected election result Pelosi and Hoyer showed a lot of grace in stepping aside, one younger Democratic lawmaker told NBC News
Everyone has their own style, but when it means others can’t ascend into leadership, then it seems a little bit unfair.  Reps.  Hakeem Jeffries, D-N
Y, 52, and Katherine Clark, D-Mass, 59, appear to have locked up support for the No.  1 and No
2 leadership slots, minority leader and minority whip.  Rep
Pete Aguilar, D-Calif, 43, a member of the Hispanic Caucus, had originally sought the assistant post, which had been considered the No
3 job the last time Democratic were in the minority But with Clyburn seeking that job, it's become a game of musical chairs Aguilar said Friday he is now running for Democratic Caucus chairman
Under that scenario, Aguilar's caucus chair role would move up to No
3 and Clyburn's assistant role would move down to No.  4
Democratic leadership elections will take place Nov
30 The shifting roles create a predicament for another young, rising star in the party, 38-year-old Rep
Joe Neguse, D-Colo, the son of Eritrean immigrants who served as a Democratic prosecutor during then-President Donald Trump’s second impeachment Neguse, who like Clyburn and Jeffries is a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, had begun his campaign to succeed the term-limited Jeffries as caucus chairman earlier this year
After months of reaching out to colleagues, he had that job mostly locked up
But with Clyburn going for the assistant job and Aguilar entering the race for caucus chair, Neguse could find himself the odd man out Neguse supporters are now urging him to stay the course and run for the caucus chair job anyway, even if it disrupts the fragile harmony between the Black and Hispanic caucuses and leads to the remote possibility that Black men could occupy three of the top four spots in a Democratic caucus that celebrates representation in leadership Many of us, and I believe a majority of us, want to see Joe Neguse become chair of our caucus, said another younger Democratic lawmaker
We find it distasteful that Pete would even consider doing what Sean Patrick Maloney did to Mondaire Jone  — a reference to New York Rep
Maloney deciding to run after redistrictin in a safer, neighboring district that had been represented by Jones, a Democratic colleague It was the sense of the caucus that the three top leaders could provide counsel but would not have official leadership posts, the lawmaker continued
Many of us think very highly of Jim Clyburn, but these complications will have potential to divide a remarkably unified caucus, the lawmaker said A lot of members are upset about the situation, added a member of the Hispanic Caucus Spokespeople for Aguilar, Neguse and Clyburn had no immediate comment One young Democrat, Rep
Jake Auchincloss of Massachusetts, said the party is rallying behind Jeffries, Clark and Aguilar Hakeem Jeffries, Katherine Clark, Pete Aguilar — they have the full confidence of House Democrats
They are the next generation of leadership, Auchincloss, who is 34, said on CN on Friday Neguse's options are limited: He could remain at the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, which is considered part of the leadership team, where he is one of four co-chairs
But sources said Neguse won't jump into the crowded race for caucus vice chair, the No
5 position in leadership, which already features Congressional Black Caucus Chair Joyce Beatty, D-Ohio, and Reps.  Madeleine Dean, D-Pa. ; Debbie Dingell, D-Mich
; and Ted Lieu, D-Calif Pelosi and Clyburn backed the full slate of Jeffries, Clark and Aguilar on Friday, while Hoyer had endorsed Jeffries for leader on Thursday Clyburn, a beloved figure in Democratic politics and a former Black Caucus chairman, called his protege Jeffries absolutely fantastic and signaled support for the younger leaders seeking the reins of the Democratic leadership apparatus In a statement, Clyburn said he will do whatever I can to assist our new generation of Democratic Leaders which I hope to be Hakeem Jeffries, Katherine Clark, and Pete Aguilar
Said Hoyer: Well, I think it’s always good for a party to have new blood and new invigoration, new enthusiasm, and new ideas
Asked how it felt to be leaving leadership after two decades, Hoyer replied with a chuckle: Not good, not good.
A Fulton County judge ruled Friday that the Georgia Secretary of State cannot prohibit counties from voting on the Saturday after Thanksgiving, a victory for the state Democratic Party and Sen.  Raphael Warnock’s campaign
The order comes after a brief legal battle between Secretary of State  Brad Raffensperger's office and the Democratic Party of Georgia over the Dec
6 Senate runoff between Warnock and Republican Herschel Walker Raffensperger, a Republican, had maintained that changes to Georgia voting laws meant that there could be no early voting on Nov
26, the only Saturday when it would have been possible for Georgians to cast an early vote in the hotly contested race Democrats and Warnock’s campaign filed suit challenging Raffensperger's determination, and Judge Thomas A
Cox agreed with their arguments in a ruling late Friday afternoon
The Court finds that the absence of the Saturday vote will irreparably harm the Plaintiffs, their members, and constituents, and their preferred runoff candidate, the judge wrote Mike Hassinger, a spokesperson for Raffensperger's office, said We disagree with the court’s order and look forward to a prompt appeal
The attorney general’s office said it planned to appeal the ruling, spokesperson Kara Richardson said The dispute centers on a provision of Senate Bill 20 , signed by Republican Gov
Brian Kemp in March 2021, which stipulates early in-person voting must end the Friday before the runoff
This year, that would be Friday, Dec.  2
The law also stipulates early in-person voting not be held on any Saturday that follows a public or legal holiday on the preceding Thursday or Friday
Raffensperger contended that meant there would be no early in-person voting on Nov
26, the Saturday following Thanksgiving
(It could not be held this weekend because the general election vote is not being certified until Nov.  21
) Attorneys for the Democrats and Warnock argued the section of the law Raffensperger cited applies to primaries and general elections, but not to runoffs
Cox agreed Voting rights groups have pushed counties in Georgia to open up early in-person voting on Nov.  22, 23 and 27
As of Friday, at least nine of the state’s 159 countie had opened up Nov
2 for early voting, and a smaller handful opened it up for Nov.  22 and 23
Lisa Murkowski has won re-election in Alask , NBC News projected Wednesday, dealing former President Donald Trump another loss in what has largely been a miserable midterm cycle for his hand-picked candidates in competitive Senate races Murkowski, one of only seven Republicans who voted to convict Trump at his second impeachment trial, survived a challenge from Trump-endorsed Kelly Tshibaka, a former Alaska Department of Administration commissioner I am honored that Alaskans — of all regions, backgrounds and party affiliations — have once again granted me their confidence to continue working with them and on their behalf in the US
Senate, Murkowski tweete Wednesday night
I look forward to continuing the important work ahead of us
Murkowski's re-election victory came in the state' first Senate contest to be decided by ranked-choice votin Rather than limiting voters to one choice, the format allows for candidates to be ranked in order of preference
Neither Murkowski nor Tshibaka, the top two-vote getters in the first roun of the Nov
8 general election, had a majority after first choices were tabulated, triggering runoff rounds Wednesday in which ballots listing eliminated candidates were reallocated to the voter’s next choices
Murkowski, Tshibaka, Democrat Patricia Chesbro and Republican Buzz Kelley all advanced from a nonpartisan August primar
Kelley later dropped out and endorsed Tshibaka, but he remained on the ballot
Wednesday’s runoff began with the second-choice votes from those who preferred the last-place Kelley being dispersed among the remaining three candidates
Chesbro was eliminated next, and the second-choice votes from her ballots helped put Murkowski over the threshold Tshibaka acknowledged her loss and congratulated Murkowski in a statement Wednesday night, while criticizing Alaska's ranked choice voting system It’s clear from the ranked choice tabulations that Sen
Lisa Murkowski has been re-elected, and I congratulate her on that, Tshibaka said
The new election system has been frustrating to many Alaskans, because it was indisputably designed as an incumbent-protection program, and it clearly worked as intended
From the start, the race largely centered on the two leading Republicans and their relationships with Trump Tshibaka, for example, had made wave by vowing not to support another Trump foil, Sen
Mitch McConnell, R-Ky, for another term as the Senate’s GOP leader if she was elected In her statement Wednesday, Tshibaka blasted McConnell for spending millions of dollars in this race on deceptive ads to secure what he wanted — a Senate minority that he can control, as opposed to a majority he could not
Murkowski became a target for the right after emerging as a rare Republican officeholder willing to criticize Trump and eventually convict him for what she believed was his incitement of the deadly insurrection at the US.  Capitol on Jan.  6, 2021
The Alaska Republican Party censure her and Trump began calling her the disaster from Alaska, ultimately backing Tshibaka to challenge her Murkowski also is known for her moderate profile in the Senate and for her willingness to work with Democrats
She was one of only three Republicans who voted to confirm Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson in April
She has bucked her party in other big votes during Trump’s administration, as well, voting with Democrats and a handful of other Republicans to block the GOP’s attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act
In a recent campaign a summing up her closing argument, Murkowski vowed to work with anyone, from either party, to advance Alaska’s priorities
Advocates of ranked-choice voting, a system that received national attention for its use in last year’s New York City mayoral election, believ the setup benefits moderate candidates who don’t play to either party’s fringe and work hardest to appeal to the broadest group of people
In the race for Alaska's at-large House seat, incumbent Rep
Mary Peltola, a Democrat, was elected to a full two-year term, defeating Republican Sarah Palin, the former governor and vice presidential nominee, NBC News projected Peltola had already made history in Augus , becoming the first Native Alaskan seated in Congress after she won the special election to replace longtime GOP Rep
Don Young, who died in Marc at the age of 88
Young and the GOP had controlled the seat for nearly five decades before her win
WASHINGTON — Despite headlines of mass layoff in corporate America and fears of recession, it's still a worker's market for those looking to get temporary holiday jobs as retailers and shippers continue to battle for employees ahead of what they expect to be a record holiday shopping season
Companies have been drastically speeding up the hiring process to boost their staffing levels amid stiff competition for workers
Some have increased pay to more than $30 an hour in some markets, are offering up to $3,000 in signing bonuses or are holding mass hiring events to secure workers before they get better offers elsewhere, according to companies, recruiters and economists Retailers are entering the holiday season amid a swirl of mixed economic signals
Inflatio remains at the highest levels in decades and there has been an uptick in mass layoffs and hiring freezes, yet the unemployment rate is still relatively low and consumer spending has continued to be strong
That leaves companies expecting another busy shopping season as they continue to grapple with a competitive job market
It still is a very, very tough hiring environment, especially in states and cities with very low unemployment rates, said Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter
Employers tell us that they are still really struggling to find qualified candidates and to find motivated willing candidates
So, even when they sign candidates, they’re very worried about ghosting, that people won’t show up on day one, because people have so many alternatives and are taking the best offer that they get
Retailers expect holiday sales to be up 6% to 8%, with companies planning to hire 450,000 to 600,000 temporary workers — at the top end, that would be a dip from last year, and if retailers meet the bottom end of their hiring targets, it would be the lowest number of temporary hires since 2009, accordin to the National Retail Federation
The holiday hiring comes at a time when retailers were already employing the highest number of workers since 2016 and the number of transportation and warehouse workers are at record highs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics
Before the holiday hiring rush, retailers were already looking to fill 800,000 open positions, according to the retail federation But at the same time, that tight labor market has provided a benefit to retailers heading into the holiday season because it has driven up wages — giving consumers more money to spend even in a time of massive inflation The labor market is a real conundrum for employers and is one of the reasons consumers have behaved in such a resilient way because wages are increasing and there’s pressure on the market, and that keeps people spending, Matt Shay, president of the retail federation, said in a call with reporters earlier this month
There are some signs though that the labor market is starting to shift in employers' favor
Job seekers are looking for seasonal work at the highest rates since 2019 ,with searches up just over 16% from last year, according to data from Indeed
Meanwhile, seasonal job postings are 2% lower than last year, according to the hiring website We see fewer job postings than we saw last year and more people looking in that smaller pool of postings, and the result of that is workers might have a little less bargaining power than they had in the seasonal market last year, said Cory Stahle, a senior economist at Indeed
But we still are in this really tight labor market where even though things have cooled off a little bit, the labor market still remains really tight
For UPS, which is hiring 100,000 seasonal workers again this holiday season, it remains a war for candidates
The company has streamlined its hiring process, cutting out in-person interviews, so that within 25 minutes it is able to process an application, give a job offer and complete the required payroll paperwork for the vast majority of its openings, including warehouse workers, package handlers and drivers
Someone isn’t applying to one job, they’re applying to 10 jobs, and the company that best meets that candidate’s needs is going to end up winning that candidate, said Matt Lavery, UPS global director of sourcing, hiring and onboarding
We’re trying to increase our odds with every candidate by being as transparent, being direct and also paying a very good wage
The company is on track to meet its hiring goal, but some regions remain particularly difficult to find workers, such as Minneapolis, parts of New England like Cape Cod, Denver and the surrounding mountain communities
It’s hard to give a national view that’s one view of the whole country
It’s really different stories within the country that you have to pay attention to and be very nimble and very agile to adjust to, Lavery said
Certain pockets may be a little better than last year, and in some areas it’s become extremely tough.  Macy’s Inc
has also been speeding up its hiring process with applications taking as little as five minutes and the majority of applicants getting an offer within 48 hours
The retailer will be adding 41,000 holiday workers at its Macy’s, Bloomingdale’s and Bluemercury stores starting at $15 an hour and is offering up to $500 in referral bonuses
This speed is imperative during holiday hiring, John Patterson, Macy’s vice president of talent, said in an email
While our application process is quick, we’re asking questions that matter
Last year, this enhanced, centralized hiring process allowed us to hire fewer colleagues of higher talent levels with more competitive pay who stayed on, resulting in a 40% reduction in turnover
Despite Amazon cuttin as many as 10,000 headquarter jobs, it said last month that it is planning to add 150,000 seasonal worker with an average starting pay for warehouse and delivery workers of $19 an hour and sign-on bonuses ranging from $1,000 to $3,000 The US
Postal Service will hire just half the number of people this year as last year, but officials say it is in a better staffing position going into the holidays than last year and has increased its automated processes to meet the rising demand
Postal officials assured members of Congress during a hearing earlier this month that they will have the staffing needed this holiday season and be able to avoid a scenario such as the one in 2020 when the agency  struggled to deliver packages by Christmas
We never have enough people, I’ve been here 25 years, but we manage
We move people around, people work overtime, people do extraordinary things, Edmund Carley, national president of the United Postmasters and Managers of America, said during the hearing
We’ve hired in the last couple of years over 400,000 people and we continue to hire, so I don’t think that I’m ever fully staffed
We’re always working, but we will deliver
It will be a successful season, I’m sure.
James Comer, R-Ky, criticized Donald Trump on Sunday for dining with Y , formerly known as Kanye West, and white supremacist Nick Fuentes at a pre-Thanksgiving dinner at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Florida last week Well, he certainly needs better judgment in who he dines with, Comer said in an interview on NBC News’ Meet the Press
I know that he’s issued a statement
He said he didn’t know who those people were
Pressed about whether he condemns Trump’s actions, Comer said he would not take a meeting with that person, nor Ye But that’s my opinion, Comer said After the news of the dinner broke, Trump's 2024 campaign went into damage control mod
Fuentes, a far-right activist and Holocaust denier is reportedly helping Ye, who recently lost major endorsements deals for having made antisemitic remarks, with his second presidential campaign, said a person familiar with the dinner conversation In a statement posted to his Truth Social platform, Trump claimed that Ye unexpectedly showed up at Mar-a-Lago with three of his friends, whom I knew nothing about — in reference to Fuentes, Trump 2016 campaign director Karen Giorno and another man who was a Ye associate, sources familiar with the dinner said
Trump, who described the dinner on the back patio as quick and uneventful, is facing backlash for having dined with Ye and Fuentes Arkansas Gov
Asa Hutchinson, a Republican, said Sunday on CNN's State of the Union that the dinner is very troubling, and it shouldn't happen
We need to avoid those kinds of empowering the extremes, Hutchinson said
And when you meet with people, you empower
And that’s what you have to avoid
You want to diminish their strength, not empower them.  Stay away from them
Hutchinson added that Trump did not have an accidental meeting with Ye: You have got to be absolutely clear in your communication that this is not acceptable dogma, it’s not acceptable conversation, it’s not acceptable history, and you have to disavow it
The dinner grew heated after Ye — who announced another run for president in 2024 on Thursday — asked Trump to be his running mate, the sources said.  Former New Jersey Gov
Chris Christie, who was once a Trump ally, was among a handful of Republicans who jabbed Trump for hosting Fuentes Christie said in an interview with The New York Time , This is just another example of an awful lack of judgment from Donald Trump, which, combined with his past poor judgments, make him an untenable general election candidate for the Republican Party in 2024.
WASHINGTON — As Republicans prepare to use their new House majority to probe the Biden administratio and the business dealings of the president's son, Hunter, Democrats are assembling a constellation of groups to respond
President Joe Biden hasn’t said if he’s running for re-election, but the groups are designed to defend him and discredit the opposition — including launching intense opposition research efforts into Republicans leading the charge in Congress — ahead of a likely rematch with former President Donald Trump in 2024 Three new war rooms have sprung up in the past two weeks to combat the House Republicans' investigations, each backed by multimillion-dollar dark money budgets and some of the best-known operatives in the Democratic Party
Meanwhile, the Democratic National Committee and major outside groups are already retooling to shift from 2022 to 2024 It’s clear the White House has been preparing for the anticipated barrage of meritless investigations from House Republicans, and outside groups are an essential component, said Adrienne Elrod, who helped run Correct the Record, which defended Hillary Clinton from congressional probes before her 2016 presidential campaign was up and running
Every White House has faced congressional investigations
But the surfeit of well-funded groups shows eagerness among Democratic donors to defend Biden — or at least stop Trump — and a recognition that the fight over public opinion is at least as important as the legal one, since it will lay the groundwork for the next campaign It’s important that the opposition not get the upper hand in defining a false narrative, and outside groups can help mitigate that from happening, Elrod noted The White House itself has been preparing for months for the barrage of inquiries, adding both legal and public relations  firepower to the White House Counsel’s Office, which is quarterbacking its effort, and encouraging federal agencies to take similar moves This summer, as it looked likely that Republicans would win one or both chambers of Congress, a small group of White House staffers began mapping out likely investigative angles, keeping close tabs on top Republican investigators, including letters of inquiry they sent to federal agencies There are a lot of constraints on the administration when responding to oversight investigations — even ones that are completely bogus — but none of which apply to outside groups, said Eric Schultz, a former Obama White House spokesperson who tangled daily with Republican congressional investigators ahead of President Barack Obama’s 2012 re-election bid For instance, government officials are prohibited by federal law from politicking
And the White House prefers to stay above the political fray, anyway
So, outside groups can provide political and PR support, especially in the absence of a Biden campaign, and can get down into the mud on especially sensitive issues like Hunter Biden Both sides insist they’re just after the truth
But the politics of the situation is undeniable and only thinly veiled.  Rep
Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, who is poised to use his likely chairmanship of the Judiciary Committee to aggressively investigate alleged politicization of the Justice Department, said last month at CPAC that the GOP majority would work to frame up the 2024 race
These are sham investigations
You can take Jordan’s word at it, said Kyle Herrig, the founder and executive director of one of the new war rooms, the Congressional Integrity Project, which is relaunching to counter the investigations
They don’t have an agenda that will help Americans
They have only one agenda and it’s a political agenda
The Congressional Integrity Projec , which already has focus groups underway, promises to be as much about offense as defense
It plans to investigate the lawmakers investigating Biden, many of whom hail from the safe congressional districts and have never faced a tough election and the kind of opposition research and media scrutiny it brings We’re going to leave no stone unturned
No one has done the investigative research we’ve done on these investigators
People in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones, Herrig said
We have a multimillion-dollar budget, and we’re staffing up with a team of researchers and communicators
Herrig’s group is working with another, Courage for Americ , which just launched
While the Congressional Integrity Project is focused on the investigations, Courage for America is focused on the legislation and personalities of the entire House GOP caucus Among other things, that means making firebrand freshman lawmakers famous
And it means highlighting and mobilizing opposition to GOP policies, such as a proposed national abortion ban and potential cuts to Social Security and Medicare The American people need to be introduced and educated about the extremist agenda of this new House and also who these members are, said Zac Petkanas, who was the Clinton campaign’s rapid response director and is now running a war room supported by Courage for America
It’s a very dangerous new caucus and we’re going to be there every single day making sure people know about it
With a seven-figure budget and support from the Hub Project, a giant Democratic dark money network, the group plans a robust operation including polling, paid advertising and social media campaigns, along with traditional opposition research and communications The third group, Facts First, was started by David Brock, the former self-described right-wing hit man who then had a political conversion and used his fundraising talent to start a series of groups that have become key parts of Democratic infrastructure
Those include Media Matters and American Bridge, both of which he stepped away from to start Facts First Brock said an American Bridge donor has already pledged six-figures to support Facts First, which he said would likely have a $10 million budget over two years
Co-founders include former Republican Rep
David Jolly, a Trump critic who has since left the party, and longtime Democratic strategist Maria Cardona
Unlike the other two groups, in order to maintain its independence, Facts First decided not to formally approach the White House for its blessing, though back-channel communications led it to believe the effort is welcome Brock, who also founded the pro-Clinton Correct the Record, said that experience taught him the new group needs to be more aggressive on social media and conduct more opinion research to understand how Americans view the controversy du jour I do believe that, absent a vigorous operation, like the one we’re putting out, I think it makes it difficult for President Biden to be re-elected, he said, before quickly adding that it’s the Republicans that are really making this a political issue
We are doing this in response
Of the new groups, Brock’s appears to be working most closely with Hunter Biden and his legal team, led by entertainment lawyer Kevin Morris
Hunter Biden’s relationship, struggles with drugs and alcohol, and business efforts to fund it all are sure to be a major focus of Republican inquiries
Republicans have long argued that Biden helped his son’s overseas business dealings — the claim was at the center of Trump’s first impeachment — but are still searching for evidence to prove it
Brock recently traveled to Los Angeles to meet with Hunter Biden and said he came away reassured I came out of that not nervous
I came out of that thinking that we’ll be able to show, over time, this is a Republican fantasy narrative driven by a lot of unreliable witnesses and spurious conspiracy theories, he said
To me, the main story here is of an addictive person who has mental health issues of the kind that are in most families in America.  . .
I also think it’s the story of Joe Biden as an empathetic father.
A top elections official in Maricopa County, Arizona, was moved to an undisclosed location for his safety following threats on social media related to the midterm elections, the county confirmed to NBC News on Monday
The official, Bill Gates, the chairman of the Maricopa County board of supervisors, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday Fox10 Phoeni first reported the news of him being moved on Sunday Election workers like Gates have experienced a rise in threats following the 2020 election and former President Donald Trump’s election lies
Gates, a Republican, told NBC News ahead of the electio that he had been working with local law enforcement amid vile emails and social media posts
At a press conference Monday, Maricopa County Sheriff Paul Penzone said he'd recommended Gates and his family go to a safe location for one night because of threats that were still under investigation
I'm always going to err on the side of overreacting to keep people safe, Penzone said
Until I felt that our detectives had a chance to get their arms around any potential threats that may do harm to him or his family, I was not going to allow for them to be in harm's way
Penzone said there had been a large number of threats toward election officials in the state, with some coming from social media and from out of state
We are not going to tolerate it, he said
A Maricopa County Board of Supervisors meeting last wee grew tense as some attendees pushed conspiracy theories, berated officials and even demanded that the election be nullified Maricopa, which was the heart of pro-Trump election denialism in 2020, became a flashpoint during this year's elections as technicians scrambled to fix dozens o malfunctioning vote tabulation machine on Election Day
It took hours before a solution was identified, prompting officials to rebuff claims that the integrity of the election was compromised
Officials at the time urged voters at polling sites where machines had malfunctioned to exercise other options, including either dropping their ballots off in a secure box or going to another location to vote Everyone is still getting to vote
No one has been disenfranchised, Gates told reporters in downtown Phoenix on Election Day, following reports of equipment problems A state judge denied an emergency request by the Republican National Committee to extend voting hours just ahead of the closing of state polls at 9 p. m
ET, saying that the GOP failed to show that anyone was actually prevented from voting Asked about whether the technical issues were further fueling distrust in the election system, Gates told NBC News on Election Day that the county's handling of the situation should give voters confidence in the election process We have hiccups, Gates told NBC News at the time
They had a hiccup with the Powerball drawing last night, right? These things happen, but I would say to them, actually this should make them feel good because they see the type of redundancies that we have in place
Despite potential safety concerns, Gates has been tweeting videos in which he explain the latest updates in the vote count proces as recently as Sunday night Some GOP politicians and pundits swiftly seize on the widespread issue of malfunctioning vote tabulation machines in Arizona’s largest county on Election Day by pushing misleading or false informatio In a post to his Truth Social account, former President Donald Trump wrote that Arizona had another big voter tabulation problem and Maricopa County was a complete Voter Integrity DISASTER
The word cheating also trended on Twitter on the morning of Election Day, with some accounts amplifying a burgeoning right-wing conspiracy theory drawing from a single video in Anthem, Arizona, in which an election worker informed a crowd that a pair of vote tabulators were not working
The worker is seen telling voters to place their ballots in Box 3, where they would get counted manually or later fed into the tabulator, a routine way to count ballots in the case of a tabulator outage Kari Lake, the GOP candidate for Arizona governor endorsed by Trump, and Arizona GOP Chairwoman Kelli Ward were among several prominent Twitter accounts who shared the video in an effort to sow doubt on the election process
Both Lake and Ward have espoused baseless claims of fraud in the 2020 presidential election
Lake on Monday attacke Maricopa County officials over both the election night technical issues and the prolonged vote count During his briefing Monday, Penzone called on political leaders to be more responsible and declined to single out Lake
There’s a lot of candidates who say things they shouldn’t, he said, including people who politically maybe didn’t see the outcomes they were hoping for
Have some courage and speak out and say these types of threats aren’t okay against our opponents any more than they would be against us
Maricopa is the fourth-largest county in the country and is widely considered the key to Arizona elections
Most of the battleground state’s ballots are cast in the county and the results of an election there typically match the outcome statewide
WASHINGTON — The Biden administratio on Saturday eased some oil sanctions on Venezuela in an effort to support newly restarted negotiations between President Nicolás Madur ’s government and its opposition The Treasury Department is allowin Chevron to resume limited energy production in Venezuela after years of sanctions that have dramatically curtailed oil and gas profits that have flowed to Maduro’s government
Earlier this year the Treasury Department again allowed the California-based Chevron and other US
companies to perform basic upkeep of wells it operates jointly with state-run oil giant PDVSA Under the new policy profits from the sale of energy would be directed to paying down debt owed to Chevron, rather than providing profits to PDVSA Talks between the Maduro government and the Unitary Platform resumed in Mexico City on Saturday after more than a yearlong pause
It remained to be seen whether they would take a different course from previous rounds of negotiations that have not brought relief to the political stalemate in the country A senior US
administration official, briefing reporters about the US
action under the condition of anonymity, said that easing the sanctions was not connected to the administration’s efforts to boost global energy production in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and that the decision was not expected to impact global energy prices The official said the US
would closely monitor Maduro’s commitment to the talks and reserved the right to reimpose stricter sanctions or to continue to ease them depending on how the negotiations proceed If Maduro again tries to use these negotiations to buy time to further consolidate his criminal dictatorship, the United States and our international partners must snap back the full force of our sanctions that brought his regime to the negotiating table in the first place, said Democratic Sen
Bob Menendez of New Jersey, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in a statement
Black voters in Louisiana are confused.  Many are embarrassed.  Some are angry
All seem to be concerned about how their state is being perceived after a constitutional amendment to eliminate slavery and forced indentured servitude failed to pas in the November election That may be, in part, because the lawmaker who authored the bill to allow the vote switched direction and worked to kill it
Four other states — Alabama, Oregon, Tennessee and Vermont — passed similar legislation, effectively ending slave labor in prisons
Louisiana, however, did not vote for the constitutional amendment, which had been introduced by Rep
Edmond Jordan, a Black politician known for fighting for Black people’s causes, like limiting police officers’ immunity in civil lawsuits In an unusual twist, Jordan initiated a campaign last summer for an amendment he authored to fail
His original bill read, Slavery and involuntary servitude are prohibited
With that language, it was clear the bill would have wiped out the 138-year-old exception in Louisiana’s Constitution that allowed involuntary servitude as punishment for a crime But Jordan agreed to an addendum to the bill, which said that the part of the constitution that prohibited slavery and involuntary servitude did not apply to the otherwise lawful administration of criminal justice
That section, Jordan said, created confusion for him and voters and made some question whether the second part of the bill was canceling out the first part
Are they trying to trick us into voting for slavery? asked John Miles, a 41-year-old Black truck driver in Monroe
Why would they make it so confusing? He said he voted no because of the lack of clarity Ultimately, the amendmen faile , with 61% voting no Jordan was fine with the amendment not passing, even though many Black voters disagreed
The measure received more no votes than yes in all 64 parishe in the state
Some of those voters, like Todd L
Sterling of Baton Rouge, say the measure passing would have represented progress rather than leaving slavery and indentured servitude in place
Its failure signifies remnants of a time many would like to forget It was a tricky bill to read if you had not done a little homework, said Sterling, owner of Alpha Media and Public Relation , an advertising agency in the state capital
It really pertains to the penal system in Louisiana, renting people out, which is modern-day slavery
If you weren’t up on the subject, and you weren’t familiar with how the penal system treats the incarcerated like slaves, you wouldn’t really think that it was a big issue
But it is in Louisiana, where inmates engage in slave labor at its state penitentiary nicknamed Angola after the former plantation on which the prison was built
According to repor by the American Civil Liberties Union and University of Chicago Law School Global Human Rights Clinic, prisoners there earn between 2 cents and 20 cents an hou , with many working in the fields on crops like sugarcane, corn, soybeans and, yes, cotton And Black inmates make up 74% of the Angola prison population Field laborers work with limited access to water, minimal rest and no restroom facilities, under the supervision of armed correctional officers on horseback, the ACLU report said And that’s why this bill was important, Sterling, 56, added
Of course, I voted for the bill because it’s long past the time we eliminate any possibility of what’s going on at Angola
That should have been a slam dunk
But now we’re the only state that has something like on the books… And that’s embarrassing
Jordan said he wanted his bill to fail so he could reintroduce it at the next legislative session, in April 2023, with easy-to-understand language
He feared there was potential for a lawmaker to use the confusing language as an opportunity to legalize slavery in Louisiana and keep indentured servitude I wasn’t even going to take the chance of some ambiguous language being used and brought to court to try to do the opposite of what we intended, Jordan said
Look at it this way: If the amendment failed, on Nov
9, we’d be no worse off than when we were on Nov.  8
But there’s a potential that we could have been worse if it had passed
… So, we need to go back to the drawing board and make sure that the language is clear so everybody knows exactly what the intent is
However, some voters remain perplexed and disheartened that, even with the language, a measure that began with ending slavery and indentured servitude did not pass It’s embarrassing
It’s terrible, said Robert Diggs, an attorney in Atlanta from Lafayette, Louisiana
I don’t see how there can be an excuse for confusing language on a bill, especially one as important as this
This needs to be corrected as soon as possible because slavery in any form of indentured servitude should not be legal anywhere in this country and much less than the world
Curt Simmons, an international foreign language teacher, said he paused when he reached the part of the ballot that asked about the controversial amendment
Simmons had recently returned to Shreveport from Prague and was unaware of the issues My first thought was: ‘Am I reading this right?’ I mean, we’re talking about slavery in 2022? Simmons said
I looked around, like ‘Does anyone else see this?’ To see that on the ballot was shocking
What made matters even worse was that he was unsure of how to vote
Finally, he said, he voted yes
I was fearful that a ‘no’ vote would support keeping it as it is, and I’m not down for that at all
It’s really sad and makes me angry that we’re still dealing with this
How can this be? Slavery in America was abolished in 1865 with the 13th Amendmen
But there is an exceptio for slavery as punishment for crime
That exception has been languishing on state constitutions for more than 100 years Curtis Ray Davis II, executive director for the abolitionist grou Decarcerate Louisiana, spent nearly 26 years in the Angola prison for a murder he said he did not commit
During his stint, he wrote the book Slave State: Evidence of Apartheid in America
He has been a social justice leader since his release in 2016 Davis told the Louisiana Illuminato that not passing the amendment was a lost opportunity to change the world for Black progress
He added that the confusing language was a form of voter suppression
They confused the issue so people didn’t know what they were voting on, Davis told the Louisiana Illuminator Judy Reese Morse, executive director of the Louisiana branch of the National Urban League, said she hopes Louisana’s failure to pass the amendment isn’t a reflection of people’s feelings about forced prison labor or slavery It absolutely is critical and essential that this legislation be put before voters again, as soon as possible, with language that is clear, so that everybody is clear about what they’re voting for or against, she said
I have to believe that every person of color in Louisiana would vote to have that removed from Louisiana’s Constitution
And I’m hoping that others as well, allies, who understand where we are in place and time in this country, would absolutely vote to have that stripped from the state’s constitution as well
But we won’t know that until we see it again.
WASHINGTON — Former President Donald Trump will be the subject of a second special counsel investigation, this one focused on his handling of classified documents found at his Mar-a-Lago hom and key aspects of the investigation int his role in the Jan
6 attack on the Capito , Attorney General Merrick Garland said Friday Based on recent developments, including Trump’s announcement that he is a candidate for president in the next election, and the current president’s intention to be a candidate in the next election, I have concluded it is in the public interest to appoint a special counsel, Garland said at a news conference Garland's decision to appoint a special counsel was first reported by th Wall Street Journa Garland said that on Friday morning he signed a lette formally naming John L
Smit , known as Jack Smith, a prosecutor at The Hague and a former federal prosecutor, to begin serving as special counsel immediately
Smith was previously the chief of the Justice Department’s Public Integrity Section, where he oversaw public corruption and elections-related investigations Smith is assigned with investigating whether anyone violated the law in connection with efforts to interfere with the lawful transfer of power following the 2020 presidential election or the certification of the Electoral College vote held on or about January 6, 2021, as well as any matters that arose or might arise directly from this investigation.  The US
Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia will continue investigating those individuals who stormed the US
Capito Garland said that Smith will also have in his portfolio the ongoing investigation involving classified documents and other presidential records taken from Trump's White House as well as the possible obstruction of that investigation
In remarks at an event at his Florida resort Friday night, Trump called Smith's appointment appalling and a horrendous abuse of power, and referred to him as a super radical left special counsel
This is a rigged deal, Trump said of the probes, complaining that he'd been going through these hoaxes, investigations and scams since day one
We are innocent, he added
Trum announce his 2024 presidential campaign this week
Given that Garland was appointed by President Joe Biden, naming a special counsel would give Garland more distance from the investigation into Trump, who could be Biden’s rival if the president decides to run for re-election This is a totally expected political stunt by a feckless, politicized, weaponized Biden Department of Justice, a Trump campaign spokesman said in a statement Following his appointment, Smith emphasized in a statement that he will conduct an independent investigation
I will exercise independent judgement and will move the investigations forward expeditiously and thoroughly to whatever outcome the facts and the law dictate, he said Trump was previously under investigation by former special counsel Robert Mueller, wh issued his report in 201 focusing on Russian interference in the 2020 election and Trump’s efforts to interfere with the Justice Department investigation Garland said he was confident in the DOJ's ability to investigate Trump, but, I also believe that appointing a special counsel at this time is the right thing to do
The extraordinary circumstances presented here demand it
Garland added that he will ensure Smith receives the resources to conduct this work quickly and completely.
WASHINGTON — Tony Ornat , who was deputy White House chief of staff under Donald Trump, is expected to appear Tuesday for an interview before the House committee investigating the Jan
6 riot at the US
Capitol, a person familiar with the panel's plans said Ornato is considered a key witness to the events surrounding the Capitol riot and will most likely be questioned about the testimony of star witness Cassidy Hutchinson, who was an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows
Hutchinson testified over the summer that Ornato told her Trump became angry when his Secret Service detail refused to take him to the Capitol as his supporters descended on the building
She said Ornato told her Trump lunged at the steering wheel of the SUV he was in, demanding to be taken up Pennsylvania Avenue to the Capitol
Ornato’s attorney, Kate Driscoll, did not specifically address his appearance Tuesday
She told NBC News, Mr
Ornato continues to cooperate with the January 6th select committee’s investigation
Committee aides declined to comment on the expected interview, which was first reported by The New York Time
Secret Service officials have questioned Hutchinson’s testimon , prompting the committee to bring some of them back for questioning under oath
Ornato has already testified, but Hutchinson’s testimony prompted the committee to call him back again
After having served in the Trump White House, Ornato was an assistant director at the Secret Service until he left the agency in August for a job in the private sector Before Thanksgiving, committee investigators spoke to Bobby Engel, who led Trump’s protective detail
And at the beginning of November, they were scheduled to meet with a Secret Service agen who was in the lead car of Trump’s motorcade on the day of the riot Meanwhile, former Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway met with the committe for nearly five hours Monday
Conway was a senior counselor to Trump from the beginning of his term through August 2020
She decided to leave the administratio because, she said, she needed to focus on her family
She also was a campaign manager for Trump’s 2016 presidential bid Even though Conway was not working for Trump on Jan
6, 2021, The Post, citing 15 Trump advisers, members of Congress, GOP officials and others, reporte that she called an aide who was with him that day and said she was joining others in urging him to tell his supporters to stand down
Conway also told the aide that Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser’s office called her asking for help getting Trump to call up the National Guard, The Post reported The committee is expected to release a final report about its investigatio before the end of the year, before the new Congress convenes in January
The panel is not expected to exist in the new, GOP-controlled House next year
Anthony Fauci appeared Tuesday at his final White House press briefing as he prepares to leave governmen next month following a half-century on the front lines of the world's gravest public health crises The idea that this may be very likely the last time I’m in that press briefing room is kind of sad
Sad, and yet with the full realization and appreciation that all things must pass
Things can’t go on forever, Fauci said in an interview earlier in the day with NBC News
Speaking at the briefing, Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and chief medical adviser to President Joe Biden, said the final message I give you from this podium is that please, for your own safety, for that of your family, get your updated Covid-19 shot as soon as you’re eligible
Fauci, 81, has directed the institute since 1984, a position bookended by the AIDS outbreak and the Covid-19 pandemic that has killed more than one million Americans He became a household name for his work on former President Donald Trump’s Covid task force, appearing regularly in the briefing room for on-camera updates about the virus where he often pushed bac against Trump’s false claims about the disease His plain-spoken warnings about the virus — at odds with Trump’s more upbeat message at the time — made him something of a pop cultural sensation, with Fauci bobblehead dolls popping up and  actors Brad Pitt and Kate McKinnon taking turns portraying him in Saturday Night Live skits
As the pandemic progressed, Fauci’s relationship with Trump soured and their back-and-forth disagreement — ranging from the severity of the viru to the best way to treat it — often spilled into public view Before he announced his plans to leave government, Fauci said he would not serv under another Trump administration
A bookish, behind-the-scenes figure for much of his career, Fauci became a target of right-wing attacks for his willingness to contradict Trump and his recommendations that lockdowns were necessary to curb the virus's spread He began traveling with government security agents as death threats and verbal abuse mounted
In his NBC interview, Fauci alluded to how his life has been upended
He declined to compare Trump and Biden — two of the seven presidents he's advised in the course of his career
I'd prefer not to get into that, he said
The attacks and blowback I get are just not worth it
Still, he made it clear that he relished his time advising Biden, who he said is completely in favor of sticking with the science, sticking with the facts, and not blaming anything but just going ahead and doing it
Republicans gained control of the US
House in the midterm elections and plan to summon Fauci to testify about his role in combatting the pandemic in the new year Fauci said he would be willing to appear and face what is certain to be hostile questioning I have a great deal of respect for the concept of oversight — legitimate oversight — and I have no problem testifying before the Congress, he said
I can explain and defend everything I've done and I have absolutely nothing to hide
At the press briefing, he was asked to reflect on the course of the virus and said that he did not imagine that the US
would see a three-year saga of suffering and death in a million Americans losing their lives The thing that was most disturbing … was the continuation of multiple variants evolving over time, Fauci said Fauci said that he expected the virus to eventually reach low levels in the US, but the speed at which the country reaches that point depends on how many people continue to get vaccinated, as well as how many people get an updated booster shot We can get there with less suffering if we use the interventions that we have, Fauci said
If you want to let nature take its course, we’re ultimately going to get there but we’re going to loose a lot more people than we need to
Fauci does not plan to retir
He told NBC News he is considering various paths that include working in academia, for a foundation or possibly on his own
He said it is highly likely he will write a book
But in a departure from so many government officials-turned authors in the post-Trump era, he said it wouldn't be a tell-all What I would like to do is encourage and perhaps inspire younger people to get involved in science, medicine and public health, Fauci said
There's a danger of an anti-science movement, and I would hope that I would be able to serve as a bit of encouragement and inspiration to younger people.
WASHINGTON — For the first time in at least a decade, a jury is set to deliberate federal seditious conspiracy charge , weighing the government's case against members of the far-right Oath Keepers organization who prosecutors say plotted to oppose the peaceful transfer of powe by force in the lead-up to the attack on the US.  Capitol on Jan
6 Oath Keepers founder Elmer Stewart Rhodes II is facing trial alongside four other defendants: Jessica Watkins, Kelly Meggs, Kenneth Harrelson and Thomas Caldwell
Watkins, Meggs and Harrelson went inside the Capitol during the attack, while Rhodes and Caldwell were present on restricted Capitol grounds on Jan.  6
Rhodes repeatedly tried to get in touch with former President Donald Trum , even after the Jan
6 attack, encouraging Trump to invoke the Insurrection Act and call upon the Oath Keepers to help keep him in the White House despite his election loss After hearing from the government last week and from the defendants' attorneys on Friday and Monday, federal prosecutors got the last word during rebuttal before the case went to the jury late Monday They took matters out of the hands of the people, and put rifles into their own hands, Assistant US
Attorney Jeffrey Nestler told jurors
They claimed to wrap themselves in the Constitution.  They trampled it instead
They claimed to be saving the Republic, but they fractured it instead
The defendants should be held accountable for agreeing to commit sedition against the government of the United States of America, Nestler said They are not above the law
We ask you to uphold the Constitution that they tried to subvert, Nestler said US
District Judge Amit Mehta told jurors they would begin deliberations at 9:30 a. m
ET on Tuesday and resume deliberations on Monday after the Thanksgiving break Federal prosecutors have not proven that the Oath Keepers had an organized plan to storm the Capitol before Jan.  6
Instead they say the alleged co-conspirators agreed to oppose the peaceful transfer of presidential power, including by using force Jason Dola , an Oath Keeper who testified that he was ready to die to keep Trump in office, told jurors that the Oath Keepers seized the opportunity to storm the Capitol when they got the chance I wanted them to be afraid of me, Dolan said, referencing members of Congress
If they weren’t going to, in my perspective, do the right thing, maybe they could be scared into doing the right thing
Graydon Youn , another Oath Keeper who cooperated with the government, said he thought he was part of a Bastille-type moment in history on Jan.  6
I guess I was acting like a traitor against my own government, Young said Three defendants — Rhodes, Caldwell and Watkins — took the stand in their own defense during the trial, which began with opening arguments on Oct.
Rhodes testified that he never directed anyone to go into the Capitol and that he said after he learned that Oath Keepers had gone into the building that it was stupi  for them to have done so
But the government played a video of Rhodes praising the patriots who stormed the Capitol and a recording of him saying that his only regret about Jan
6 was that they should have brought rifle
Prosecutors also showed that Rhodes tried to send a message to Trum after the attack Caldwell, who is accused of helping set up a quick reaction force with weapons in Virginia, put a spin on the events of Jan
6 in testimony before the jury in testimony that seemed to backfire
When his wife Sharon Caldwell said members of Congress were p-----s on the steps of the Capitol on Jan
6, Thomas Caldwell claimed she really meant that there was a great opportunity for us to start the healing process in our country
He said that when he talked about bringing in heavy weapons by boat, he was actually engaged in creative writing and just referencing a screenplay he wrote Jan
6 did happen, Caldwell said on the stand, and I had nothing to do with it
Watkins was much more apologetic on the stand than Rhodes or Caldwell
She told jurors that she felt like she was part of a historic moment and that rioters were making history on Jan.  6
I feel terrible about it in hindsight, she said but added that her actions were not premeditated
Watkins said what she did was really stupid and that she was just another idiot running around in the Capitol
The last time the Justice Department brought seditious conspiracy charges was in 2010 when the FBI arrested members of the Hutaree militia in Michiga
A federal judge tosse those charges in 2012, finding the government did not present enough evidence of a conspiracy against the government
In 1995, a jury convicted Blind Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman and other on seditious conspiracy charges in connection with the 1993 World Trade Center bombing Seditious conspiracy is a Civil War-era law that makes it illegal to conspire to overthrow, put down or to destroy by forc  the US
government or to prevent, hinder, or delay the execution of any law of the United States by force
WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden stepped up calls for Congress to avert a looming rail strike in a meeting at the White House with top lawmakers Tuesday, warning that the economy was at risk if they failed to act in the next few days
Talks between railway workers and their employers appear to have stalled, making the prospect of a Dec.  9 strike more imminent
Shipments of crucial materials, like chemicals used to treat drinking water, are set to start winding down this week, industry leaders have warned, after some railway unions rejecte an agreement between labor leaders and railway companies
Congress, I think, has to act appropriately
It’s not an easy call, but I think we have to do it, Biden said before the meeting
The economy is at risk
Congress has the authority to block a strike and impose a labor agreement on the workers under a 1926 law intended to prevent the interruption of interstate commerce in labor disputes
But doing so would require bridging fundamental divides over Democrats’ long-held support for unions and Republicans’ support for businesses in less than 10 days
After the meeting with Biden, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N
Y, said he would work with Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky to get a deal done as possible
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif, said the House would vote on a bill Wednesday The leader and I are going to have to get together and try to get that done, and we are working on it, Schumer told reporters when he was asked whether he had enough votes to pass legislation McConnell echoed Schumer, saying Congress needed to pass a bill
Biden got directly involve Monday, saying Congress should immediately pass legislation to adopt a tentative agreement reached between labor leaders and railway operators in September — but rejected by four of the 12 unions — to avert a potentially crippling national rail shutdown that would devastate the economy It was a shift in messaging for the White House, which for weeks has said the best solution would be for the workers and employers to reach a resolution on their own by adopting the September deal, which the administration helped broker Companies across a variety of industries, including retailers, farmers, oil producers and chemical makers, have increasingly raised alarms in recent weeks about the massive disruption a strike would cause across the economy
But so far, there has been little momentum in Congress to pass any legislation to avert a strike as lawmakers return from the Thanksgiving recess with an already packed schedule
Congress can take several steps to prevent a rail strike, which it has done 18 times since the 1960s
It could extend the so-called cooling-off period, giving the parties more time to try to reach a voluntary agreement before workers can strike
It could also impose a labor agreement on the workers similar to the one already agreed to by labor leaders and carriers or make modifications to the agreement that could be more or less favorable to workers or their employers
Pelosi said the House would vote this week on the legislation Biden is calling for, which wouldn’t make any changes to the current agreement
This week, the House will take up a bill adopting the Tentative Agreement — with no poison pills or changes to the negotiated terms — and send it to the Senate, she said in a statement following Biden’s House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif, left the White House meeting critical of the need to pass legislation but saying he thought it would pass
I think it will pass, but it’s unfortunate this is how we’re running our economy today, McCarthy said
The bigger obstacle may lie with the Senate, where Democrats and Republicans will need to come together to get the 60 votes needed to avoid a filibuster
For Democrats, imposing a contract on workers would seem to fly in the face of the pro-union positions many have spent their careers advocating for and risk upsetting their key constituency of union members and labor leaders
But it could also provide an opportunity for Democrats to step in and give additional benefits to the rail workers, like paid sick days, although that would likely make it more difficult to get Republican support.  Sen
Bernie Sanders, I-Vt, blocked legislation in September that would have averted a potential strike at the time before a tentative agreement was reached, arguing that rail workers needed better sick leave As for Republicans, the prospect of a strike gives them an opportunity to blast Biden for his handling of the economy and fan the flames of a potential economic disruption that could hurt Democrats in the next election
It could also give them an opening to weaken the contract brokered with labor leaders, making it more favorable to the industry.  Sen
Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the top Republican on the Commerce Committee, sounded an optimistic tone
The president says he is going to ask Congress to act, and I would expect Congress to support that request, he said
The companies have warned that a shutdown of the railways would quickly result in cities’ running out of clean drinking water, shortages of fuel and farmers’ being unable to get feed for their livestock
It would also cause manufacturing across a variety of sectors to grind to a halt and result in backlogs at the ports with trains unable to transport cargo off ships
If you look at the national harm that would come around even by the build-up of a strike, it is simply untenable, and we are well past time for having Congress step in and resolve this, said John Drake, the vice president of transportation, infrastructure and supply chain policy for the US.  Chamber of Commerce
They aren’t going to have a choice, he said
This is not something where we have time to dither around with it
Congressional leadership is going to have to step in and take action, and we are going to need bipartisan support, and frankly, we have run out of time for political games
We need a solution now
More than 400 industry groups signed on to a lette Monday imploring congressional leaders to act and warning that a strike would result in certain economic destruction
The White House estimates as many as 765,000 people in the US
could be put out of work in the first two weeks of a strike The only thing standing in the way of ensuring that the American economy doesn't take a major hit as a consequence of a catastrophic rail strike is the United States Congress, Mike Sommers, the head of the American Petroleum Institute, said in a call with reporters
We need to make sure that the United States Congress acts on this as quickly as possible to take away any threat of that economic calamity from occurring.
Former President Donald Trump distanced himself Friday from a pre-Thanksgiving dinner at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida with Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, and white supremacist Nick Fuentes, claiming he didn’t know the identity of the far-right activist who was unexpectedly brought along with the rapper
This past week, Kanye West called me to have dinner at Mar-a-Lago
Shortly thereafter, he unexpectedly showed up with three of his friends, whom I knew nothing about, Trump said Friday in a statement on his Truth Social platform We had dinner on Tuesday evening with many members present on the back patio
The dinner was quick and uneventful, Trump said
They then left for the airport
On Saturday, Deputy White House Press Secretary Andrew Bates denounced the meeting
Bigotry, hate, and antisemitism have absolutely no place in America — including at Mar-A-Lago, he wrote
Holocaust denial is repugnant and dangerous, and it must be forcefully condemned
The president, asked by reporters for his reaction, responded, You don’t want to hear what I think
A person familiar with the dinner conversation who is not involved in Trump's presidential campaign and two Trump advisers briefed on the dinner corroborated Trump's claim that he didn't know Fuentes' identity when they dined together
The three sources spoke on condition on anonymity given the nature of the controversy But despite Trump suggesting that the event was uneventful, the fallout over his dinner with Fuentes appears to have thrown Trump’s campaign into damage control mode
The former president took hours to respond publicly after multiple media outlets reported that Fuentes was present at the dinner
Even the two Trump advisers winced at how a Holocaust denie like Fuentes was able to wind up with Trump at dinner — even if it was by mistake — along with the rapper, who had just had his Twitter account restore but lost major endorsement deals for making antisemitic remarks This is a f---ing nightmare, said one longtime Trump adviser who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of stoking the former president's ire at disloyal people who criticize him
If people are looking at [Florida Gov
Ron] DeSantis to run against Trump, here's another reason why
All three sources familiar with the dinner told NBC News there was one glaring inaccuracy in Trump’s statement: Trump knew one of the three friends brought by the rapper, Karen Giorno
She was the Trump campaign's Florida director in 2016 and the former president knows her by name and sight, the sources said
In addition to Giorno and Fuentes, Ye also brought along another man who was an associate, according to the sources The source familiar with the dinner conversation said the dinner grew heated after Ye — who announced another run for president in 2024 on Thursday — asked Trump to be his running mate
Trump then began insulting Ye’s ex-wife, Kim Kardashian, according to the source and a vide that Ye posted to Twitter on Thanksgiving Day recounting the dinner The source also said Fuentes is helping to advise Ye in his second presidential campaign
The rapper has said the campaign would be managed by Milo Yiannopoulos, a far-right provocateur and former Breitbart editor who was banned from Twitter in 2016 for inciting a racist campaign against comedian Leslie Jones Ye, Fuentes and Yiannopoulos declined to comment on the dinner Details about the dinner began to emerge on Twitter Wednesday when a Politico reporter tweete that Ye and Fuentes had been spotted at Mar-a-Lago
The conservative website Timcast confirmed Fuentes's presence at the dinner, followed by Axios
The porous nature of Mar-a-Lago, where anyone with connections can run into Trump, has long been a concern of his advisers
It’s also helped land Trump in the sights of a federal investigation after the FBI in August executed a search warrant at the club in search of documents marked classified that the federal government says Trump should not have possessed Trump’s statement on Truth Social did not disavow antisemitism or racism, but his campaign in a follow-up message pointed to Trump’s support of Israel, the Abraham Accords Middle East peace deal his administration reached and his opposition to antisemitism in Iran But Trump has also embrace antisemitic trope and figures, implying that American Jews have dual loyalty to Israel and saying that there were very fine people on both side  at the white supremacist Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia,  in 2017
Fuentes attended that event, and after Trump said he denounced white supremacy at the rally, Fuentes denounce him for that In his video debrief, Ye said that Trump is really impressed with Nick Fuentes
Nick Fuentes — unlike so many of the lawyers and so many people that he was left with on his 2020 campaign — he’s actually a loyalist [for Trump]
The source independent of Trump’s campaign said Trump had planned to dine privately with Ye at Mar-a-Lago’s library, but he then said they should eat outside on the public patio
The former president also invited the others along The subject of racism and antisemitism didn’t come up, and Fuentes presented as statistician
He was very knowledgeable of polls and Trump’s campaign
Trump was very impressed but Trump didn’t know who he was, the source said Trump asked Fuentes about his 2024 announcement speech the week before and Fuentes criticized Trump for being too teleprompter scripted and having low energy the source said
Fuentes and West, the source added, also said Trump should have issued a blanket pardon for everyone involved in the Capitol riot on Jan
6, 2021, which Ye’s video debrief also mentioned Trump also mentioned his adviser, Jason Miller, to Fuentes, who criticized the veteran operative for now running the social media site Gettr, which has banned Fuentes, according to a copy of a group text message exchang that Ye posted to Twitter Thursday Trump’s Truth Social platform, however, has verified Fuente as a notable user At a certain point, the conversation turned tense and Trump began making his critical remarks about Ye’s ex, Kardashian
That’s the mother of my children, Ye protested, according to his video debrief Trump then grew animated about Ye challenging him
You’re not going to win
You can’t beat me, Trump told Ye, the source said
Nick, you work for the guy, and just because you work for him, you’re going to tell him he can beat me? You just got finished telling me I was the best president ever
Ye said in his video debrief that Trump was angry When Trump started basically screaming at me at the table telling me I was going to lose, I mean, has that ever worked for anyone in history? the rapper said
I’m like hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, Trump.  You’re talkin’ to Ye.
ATLANTA — The Georgia Supreme Court Wednesday reinstated the state’s ban on abortion after roughly six weeks of pregnanc In a one-page order, the high court put a lower court ruling overturning the ban on hold while it considers an appeal
Abortion providers who had resumed performing the procedure past six weeks after the lower court ruling will again have to stop The order said seven of the nine justices had agreed to the decision
It said one was disqualified and another did not participate Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney ruled on November 15 that the state’s abortion ban was invalid because when it was signed into law in 2019, US
Supreme Court precedent under Roe.  v
Wade and another ruling allowed abortion well past six weeks The decision immediately prohibited enforcement of the abortion ban statewide
Abortion providers had resumed performing the procedure past six weeks, though some said they were proceeding cautiously over concerns the ban could be quickly reinstated The state attorney general’s office appealed the ruling to the state Supreme Court
It also asked the high court for an order putting the decision on hold while the appeal was pending Georgia’s ban took effect in July, after the US
Supreme Court overturned Roe v.  Wade
It prohibited most abortions once a detectable human heartbeat was present Cardiac activity can be detected by ultrasound in cells within an embryo that will eventually become the heart around six weeks into a pregnancy
That means most abortions in Georgia were effectively banned at a point before many people knew they were pregnant
WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden said Thursday he would make a renewed effort to enact a ban on assault-style rifles following a wave of mass shooting that have again put a spotlight on the nation’s gun laws Speaking to reporters during a visit to a fire station on Thanksgiving morning, the president reiterated his long-standing argument that such weapons are a societal menace and should not be sold The idea that we still allow semi-automatic weapons to be purchased is sick, he said while greeting firefighters in Nantucket, Massachusetts, where he and his family are spending the Thanksgiving holiday
It has no, no social redeeming value.  Zero.  None
Not a single solitary rationale for it except profit for the gun manufacturers
Congress has proved reluctant to outlaw AR-15s and other assault-style guns
The Democratic-controlled House passe a ban in July, in a vote largely along party lines
But the bill stands little chance of advancing in the Senate, where 10 Republicans would need to join a unified Democratic caucus to break a filibuster Biden was asked if he might press for a ban in the congressional lame-duck session, when outgoing lawmakers who aren’t facing another election might feel freer to break with base voters and the well-funded gun lobby I’m going to try, Biden said I’m going to do it whenever I . . .  he continued
I got to make that assessment as I get in and start counting the votes
Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment Biden’s remarks came two days after officials said a night manager at a Walmart store in Virginia opened fire on his co-workers, killing si and leaving at least a half-dozen others wounded
The suspect, identified as 31-year-old Andre Bing, apparently took his own life Authorities said he was armed with a handgun Mass shootings have been taking place with chilling frequency
On Saturday, a gunman killed five peopl and injured 19 others at Club Q, an LGBTQ club in Colorado Springs, Colorado
Police said patrons may have prevented more deaths by confronting and disarming the suspect, identified by officials as Anderson Lee Aldrich, 22
The weapon used was in the style of a Colt AR-15, according to Colorado Springs Police Chief Adrian Vasquez The president and first lady Jill Biden on Thursday phoned Club Q's owners, according to the White House
They told the two owners, Nic Grzecka and Matthew Haynes, that they are committed to combating hate and gun violence, the White House said Biden has a long history with the up-and-down efforts to prohibit the sale of assault-style weapons
As a senator from Delaware in 1994, he helped usher in an assault weapons ban that was credited with curbing death from mass shootings
The ban expired 10 years later, during the administration of President George W
Bush, and was never renewed Bide promise during his 2020 campaign to outlaw the sale and manufacture of assault weapons, and in a televised town hall event last month, he reiterated that he would make good on that pledge By the way, I’m going to get an assault weapons ban, the president told CN
Before this is over, I’m going to get that again
Not a joke, and watch
With Republicans set to take control of the House in 2023, the year-end lame-duck session may be a final opportunity for Biden to fulfill his goal before the 2024 presidential election I’m going to try and get rid of assault weapons, Biden said at the fire station The first family returned to the Massachusetts island in a tradition that started decades ago when Joe and Jill Biden were still dating The president and the first lady delivered pumpkin pies to the firefighters in Nantucket, accompanied by their grandson, Beau, who was given a tiny fire helmet to wear
They also called into the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day parad in New York City, offering their thanks to firefighters and service members, and said their day would be a quiet one We’re just going to have dinner with the family, probably take a walk on the beach, and just feel gratitude for our family, Jill Biden said
WASHINGTON — Days after denying Republicans the Senate majorit they fought for in the midterm elections, the Democrats' campaign chief warned the GOP: If former President Donald Trump continues to be your leader, voters will continue to punish you There’s no question that Donald Trump is a motivating factor for turnout when it comes to Democratic voters, Sen
Gary Peters, of Michigan, said in an interview at Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee headquarters And as Trump announces a 2024 presidential ru , Peters says his dominance over the GOP will come at a cost — unless Republicans reject the former president, who stirred up a mob that attacked the Capitol, and his brand of politics It depends what the party does
If the party continues to be following the Trump model and is Trumpian and doesn’t go back to their more conservative roots of the traditional Republican Party, I will say, definitely that’ll be a problem, he said Peters entered the 2022 cycle with a daunting task: to preserve the thinnest possible majority in what is typically a losing year for a party in control of the White House and Congress, a task made even more daunting this year by a president underwater in his approval rating and widespread economic pain throughout the country Democrats defied gravity, clinching 50 Senate seats and losing no incumbents
They can make it 51 in the Dec
6 Georgia runof if Democratic Sen
Raphael Warnock finishes ahead of Republican rival Herschel Walker again, as he did in the general election
The GOP's failure to recapture the Senate has led to recrimination and a dispute about whether Trump was to blame for their underperformance
This is historic, Peters said
For the party in power in the White House, and given where we are with inflation and other factors, to not lose a seat right now — I believe we will gain a seat — is truly historic
Peters insists he never bought in to the GOP boasts of a red wave
He ignored projections that the fundamentals of the midterms would swamp Democratic senators in states like Nevada, Arizona and New Hampshire
Our numbers were actually pretty consistent, he said
We knew we were going in a tough environment
Apart from Trump, Peters said abortion was a motivating facto for suburban voters and credited the party’s unprecedented early investments in ground operations for the win, adding the attacks on democracy from the election denial folk  had an impact
People do care about that in this country
It was particularly evident in suburban areas
Peters said There are difficult lessons for Democrats, too
Peters conceded that his party has a problem in rural areas — which trended even further away from his party in the 2022 cycle — and needs to show up with a robust rural agenda that is meaningful to voters there Peters has been the antithesis of Sen
Rick Scott, R-Fla, his counterpart who runs the Republican campaign arm
While Scott began the cycle with bold predictions of a 2010-style red wave, the soft-spoken Michigan Democrat stayed out of the limelight
While Scott broke ranks with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnel and released a controversial agend that became fodder for Democratic attack ads, Peters says he worked in lockstep with Majority Leader Chuck Schumer throughout the cycle Now, Scott and McConnell are engaged in an ugly public clas over why their party failed to win the Senat , with their advisers publicly questioning whether the other is doing enough to help Walker in the Georgia runoff
Scott has sought to align with the Trump wing of the party while the former president persistently attacks McConnell and blames the minority leader for the party's failures in 2022 I’ll just contrast that to where we are, said Peters, resisting an opportunity to gloat
Clearly we’re totally united in this race in Georgia
Chuck Schumer and I work very closely together, and are working closely together as a team to ensure that we get to 51
Peters said the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has committed to spending $7 million in Georgia to help Warnock, and we’ll continue to make investments in various areas in Georgia going forward
He added that part of the challenge is to remind voters that Dec
6 is Election Day, given that it’s not intuitive to many And Trump, again, looms over the runoff
The former president's early endorsement of Walker enabled him to clear the Republican primary field, and he reiterated his support for the former football star in his speech announcing his 2024 presidential candidacy in Florida
Despite the outcome in the Senate, we cannot lose hope
And we must all work very hard for a gentleman and a great person named Herschel Walker, said Trump, who became the first Republican presidential candidate since 1992 to lose Georgia Warnock, sensing an opportunity to mobilize his party’s base, cut that video into a campaign ad and displayed Stop Donald Trump
Stop Herschel Walker on the screen
Fifteen Republican states on Monday night asked a federal judge to keep a Covid-era polic in place that allowed authorities to severely restrict asylum-seekers from crossing the border into the country after the judge issued a rulin last week that blocked the rule The GOP states said that lifting the rule, which the Biden admin straight has sought to end, will increase the flow of migrants and directly harm them Because invalidation of the Title 42 Orders will directly harm the States, they now seek to intervene to offer a defense of the Title 42 policy so that its validity can be resolved on the merits, rather than through strategic surrender, the states said in their filing Monday
They argue that an increase in migrant flows to the border will impose financial burdens on the states involuntarily hosting them and that the states themselves are entitled to special solitude in the standing analysis
The States have sovereign and quasi-sovereign interests in controlling their borders, limiting the persons present within those borders, excluding persons carrying communicable diseases, and the enforcement of immigration law, the filing said Last week, US
District Judge Emmet Sullivan vacate the controversial rule, known as Title 42, which US
Customs and Border Protection has used to turn back migrants at the border before they could make asylum claims
Sullivan sided with the American Civil Liberties Union and other immigration advocates, who argue that the rule was being used a tool to enforce the border more than a public health measure Sullivan cited the Administrative Procedures Act in his ruling, and characterized Title 42 as arbitrary and capricious
The Biden administration indicated that it won’t oppose Sullivan’s order in a court filing last week, but requested a temporary delay in lifting Title 42 The Department of Homeland Security requested five weeks to prepare to transition to processing all migrants under pre-Covid policies, allowing them to cross the southern border to claim asylum
In his order, Sullivan granted the request with great reluctance
Title 42 is set to come to an end on Dec
20, taking effect on midnight Dec.  21 To be clear. .
Title 42 would remain in place for some period
During the period of this freeze, we will prepare for an orderly transition to new policies at the border, DHS said in a statement last week Sullivan’s ruling last week was issued months after a federal judge in Louisiana rule in favor of an attempt by the same 15 states — Arizona, Louisiana, Alabama, Alaska, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming — to keep the policy in place Lee Gelernt of ACLU, lead lawyer for the plaintiffs seeking to lift Title 42, pushed back against the GOP states seeking to keep the rule in place in a statement to NBC News Title 42 is not about general border enforcement but public health, and these states cannot plausibly claim they are seeking to intervene because of their concern about COVID, Gelernt said
In April, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas formally announced that the agency would end Title 42 on May 23 and allow families and single adult asylum-seekers who had been turned away at the border to enter the US
At the time, thousands of migrants were living in poor conditions and camps in northern Mexico after having been turned back from crossing The Biden administration has faced pushback from both parties for its handling of Title 42
Republicans have widely oppose ending the policy, and some centrist Democrats expressed skepticis on whether the administration is prepared for an uptick of asylum-seekers
C, on Tuesday testified before a Georgia grand jury investigatin possible interference in the 2020 presidential election Graham's office said in a statement he testified for just over two hours and answered the grand jury's questions The Senator feels he was treated with respect, professionalism, and courtesy, the statement said
Out of respect for the grand jury process he will not comment on the substance of the questions
The Supreme Court earlier this month rejecte Graham's request to quash a subpoena from the grand jury in the Georgia probe
Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, who is heading the investigation, is seeking details about phone calls Graham made to top election officials in Georgia amid disproven allegations from then-President Donald Trump about widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election The Supreme Court’s ruling allowed the grand jury’s subpoena to be enforced, but Graham could refuse to answer questions by invoking his right against self-incrimination under the Constitution’s Fifth Amendment Graham had argued that he shouldn’t have to offer testimony about the calls because it was part of his duties leading up to Congress’ vote to certify the election results, and therefore the subpoena infringes upon the Constitution’s speech or debate clause that protects lawmakers from investigations over comments they make in their official duties Willis' office is probing a pair of post-election phone calls Graham made to Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and his staff
Raffensperger, a Republican targeted by Trump and his allies, alleged that Graham suggested that he had the authority to reject certain legally cast ballots
Graham denied having made such a suggestion, saying he was trying to understand the state’s process for verifying ballot signatures
Texas officials have responded with urgency to complaints about problems at the polls in Harris County, a response civil rights groups  say is far different from when they report voting obstacles.  Texas Gov
Greg Abbott, a Republican, has called fo a criminal investigation into problems in the largely Democratic county, stating there has been confusion and delays, missing keys, insufficient paper ballots at Republican precincts, staffing problems and more
He said the problems could range from malfeasance to criminal conduct
But the urgency assigned to Election Day problems comes in a state that is being sued by civil rights, voting group and the Justice Departmen over a sweeping voting law Abbott signed last year
The trial is pending Republican state Sen
Paul Bettencourt, Harris County's former elections administrator, announced this week that he had refiled a bill proposing to create election marshals made up of law enforcement agents
He wants to dispatch them to polling sites to investigate potential voting violations on election days Civil rights groups have long complained about long lines, insufficient voting machines in predominantly Latino and Black areas, voter intimidation and other issues
Students at Prairie View A&amp;M have repeatedly proteste problems on election days, and in 2020 Black and Latino voters faced long wait time in Harris County
The state has been ranked near the botto in making voting easier
In 2019, several civil rights and other groups sued Texas to stop the g removal of 100,000 people from voter rolls after questioning their citizenship statu based on flawed law enforcement data
There’s clearly a double standard, said Thomas Saenz, president and general counsel of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund Obviously, we think government should take all steps to facilitate participation by everyone who is eligible, Saenz said
The state of Texas has gone in the opposite direction
Daniel Griffith, senior policy director at Secure Democracy, which focuses on improving voting and voter access, said that the energetic campaign that Texas officials and the GOP are waging, even rising to the level of including law enforcement and criminal justice, is over issues commonly seen in elections and that at face value sound like the typical sorts of snafus that happen on Election Day
Andy Taylor, the attorney representing Harris County Republicans disagrees that the mistakes in the county are isolated and innocent
He called them a total systemic failure Taylor said that because of his preliminary investigation, some defeated candidates will be contesting their election results Taylor alleges that some people voted twice because of a malfunction in the scanning of second pages of completed ballots and in how that problem was corrected
He said the county ended up with more votes than voters in some races
The problems were exacerbated, he said, when a judge ruled that some polls could stay open later because of delayed opening and the filing of a civil rights lawsui
He also said the county had committed a crime when it released early vote totals before some of the polls with extended hours had closed I think the question that’s on the table is whether what happened in Harris County is simply the byproduct of extreme and gross incompetence or whether it was by conscious design, said Taylor, who served as George W
Bush’s attorney when results of the 2000 presidential election were contested in Florida
That requires a thorough criminal investigation
He said the issues he's raising are of bipartisan concern to all voters
After all the dust settles . .
it could well be a significant number of polling places in either impoverished or minority concentration areas have been disproportionately affected, he said
Harris County Elections Administrator Clifford Tatum said in an email that his office is fully committed to transparency on Election Day processes and procedures, has been cooperating with the secretary of state’s auditing team and is tabulating votes of provisional ballots Tatum said his office is reviewing issues and claims about Election Day and will address them promptly in a report to the county elections commission and county commissioner’s court, the governing body The investigation Abbott wants would be on top of an ongoing  audit of the county’s election system, begun before Election Day
The audit, started after the 2020 election, includes two Republican counties and one Democratic county
Conservative groups began pushing for audits of election returns in various states in 2020 after former President Donald Trump falsely claimed that the election had been stolen from him
Those claims are considered to have played a part in the Jan
6 attack on the Capito
Also, Harris County’s district attorney, a Democrat who has clashed with county Judge Lina Hidalgo, also a Democrat, is calling for Texas Rangers to investigate after the Republican secretary of state informed her of alleged irregularities regarding voting, which the office said could include criminal conduct Texas Democratic Party leaders and the Harris County Democratic Party chair criticized Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg’s planned investigation, calling on her to stop enabling Texas Republicans' insidious efforts to silence Black and Brown Houstonians
In 2021, Texas Republicans moved mountains to make it harder for Black and Brown residents of Harris County to vote
It appears that in 2022, after Democrats made significant holds and gains in Harris, Republicans are doubling down on their voter suppression efforts, the Democrats said in a statement late Thursday Ogg said in a statement her office is statutorily required to investigate election irregularities and such investigations are done regardless of party affiliation
Findings from the Texas Rangers investigation will be turned over to a grand jury, she stated
She noted previous investigations after the 2020 elections, which led to indictment of three Democrats and two Republicans
It has not gone unnoticed that Democrat-voting Harris County is the target of the state's urgent response
The county, the largest in the state and third largest in the country, is majority minority and Democrats control most of the county’s government positions
In the pandemic, Harris County implemented 24-hour voting and drive-thru voting, which voters of color had a higher propensit to use than other racial groups
The  law Abbott signed last year banned those Harris County initiatives
The state was very quick to get rid of those, Griffith said James Slattery, senior supervising legislative attorney for the Texas Civil Rights Project, said his group documented late openings in other voting sites in Fort Bend, Hidalgo, Tarrant, Bell and Dallas counties
A state district court judge allowe Bell County to keep its polling locations open an hour later because of machine malfunctions
At least one other county had paper shortage issues, he said
The state is always upset about how elections are run in Harris County, even when there are similar problems elsewhere, Slattery said
If the government actually cared about these issues, we have a whole database of problems going back years.  CORRECTIO (Nov.  21 2022, 11:28 a. m
ET): A previous version of this article misstated who granted Bell County permission to keep its polling locations open an hour later on Election Day
A state district court judge, not the secretary of state’s office, granted the request for delayed closings
Jack Daniel’s Whiskey has a bone to pick with a dog toy company, and the Supreme Court on Monday agreed to hear their case VIP Products, an Arizona-based company, makes dog toys that resemble Jack Daniel's iconic whiskey bottles
The Bad Spaniels Silly Squeaker toys are labeled 43% Poo by Vol
and the Old No
2 on Your Tennessee Carpet
Jack Daniel’s is arguing that the toys are a violation of federal trademark rights and tarnish the company’s brand The company said in a filing opposing th motion that the products are a playful parodic tradition they have carried on for more than 50 years with a variety of toys including Topps's Wacky Packages trading cards and 'Weird Al' Yankovic
It is ironic that America’s leading distiller of whiskey both lacks a sense of humor and does not recognize when it — and everyone else— has had enough, the brief states
VIP has never sold whiskey or other comestibles, nor has it used Jack Daniel’s in any way (humorously or not)
It merely mimicked enough of the iconic bottle that people would get the joke.  The US
Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in 202 ruled in favor of VIP Products, saying that their toys are protected under the First Amendment, which prompted Jack Daniel's to seek further review from the Supreme Court Several companies including Campbell's Soup Co
and Levi Strauss filed motions in support of Jack Daniel's urging the high court to clarify trademark laws and when they allow such parodies We are pleased that the Supreme Court has decided to hear this case, said Courtney Armour, the chief legal officer for the Distilled Spirits Council, a trade group that represents major spirits brands, including Jack Daniel's parent company Brown–Forman
The alcohol beverage industry has long worked to ensure that our products are advertised in a responsible manner and trademark infringers can severely jeopardize these efforts
VIP Products lost a similar case in 200 when Anheuser-Busch sued the company over a toy labeled ButtWiper
The high court will likely hear arguments in the Jack Daniel's case early next year
Iowa’s Republican Party chair wants to make it as difficult as possible for national Democrats to dethrone his state from its early perch in the presidential primary season, even if it means moving the state's caucuses up by several months
Iowa GOP Chair Jeff Kaufmann, who also heads the national GOP committee that oversees its presidential schedule, wants both parties in his state to hold their caucuses on the same day, even though there's no rule that mandates they do so
National Democrats are pursuing an overhau to their primary schedule, including dropping Iowa amid complaints that it isn’t racially or ethnically diverse and has grown so red it isn’t worth the early investment
But if a different state were to move into Iowa’s slot for Democrats, Kaufmann said he will make sure he keeps jumping so Iowa’s Republican caucus goes first
This is the Democrats that are pulling this crap and I’m telling you right now, they don’t want to play chicken with me
This is pure, progressive, power politics, Kaufmann told NBC News Friday
Kaufmann’s position could complicate the overall schedule even more since New Hampshire has a law on the books that it has to hold its primary just after Iowa’s caucuses If, for some reason, California and New York dictate policy for the entire DNC and they give the middle finger to Iowa and the Midwest — if that happens, we will be first, Kaufmann said
I’ll move this thing to Halloween if that’s what it takes
The caucuses are typically not scheduled until January or early February of the same year as the presidential race Kaufmann also laid into President Biden’s agriculture secretary, Tom Vilsack, a onetime presidential contender and former Iowa governor, saying he and other Democratic leaders weren’t doing enough to preserve Iowa’s first place in line
Vilsack did not respond to a request for comment
Kaufmann argued it was detrimental to the entire system if Democrats pulled out of Iowa as a first-in-the-nation caucus since the two parties typically agree to hold their caucuses on the same day
Iowa’s Democratic Party Chair Ross Wilburn noted that even if Democrats put the state later, Republicans would still be campaigning in Iowa earl and testing their messages to rural voters, putting Democrats at a disadvantage with that electorate if they abandon the smaller state
We can’t allow our presidential campaigns to be solely decided by campaigns that can only afford TV ads or by corporate special interest groups who have the funds to pay for their candidate to get exposure in larger media markets, Wilburn said
We believe we need to have small rural states like Iowa, in the mix
The discussion comes after Democrats scrapped the old calendar and opened up the process so all states could apply to be early contenders
That old system began with the Iowa caucuses, then went to the New Hampshire primary, Nevada and South Carolina
These early positions are prized since they create an economic bump in states that are flooded with advertising dollars and on-the-ground organizations
Dozens of states have now applied to take one of the early state positions
They include all of the states that have previously gone early, while Nevada is attempting to replace New Hampshire as the first-in-the-nation primary
Both Minnesota and Michigan are making plays to move into a Midwestern slot should Iowa be dropped from the early rotation
The Democratic National Committee’s rules and bylaws committee is scheduled to meet in early December in Washington to discuss the presidential primary schedule.
Jared Polis, the first openly gay man elected governo in the United States, on Sunday decried Saturday's horrific deadly shooting a a Colorado Springs LGBTQ nightclub This is horrific, sickening, and devastating, Polis, a Democrat, said in a statemen addressing the attack at Club Q
My heart breaks for the family and friends of those lost, injured, and traumatized in this horrific shooting
Follow along for live coverage of the shooting
Polis posted a heartbreak emoji in a post to his personal Twitter account later Sunday in an apparent reference to the shooting Polis tested positive for Covid on Thursday but was asymptomatic and working from home, according to his offic Though Colorado was once known as the hate state after voters in 1992 passed a ballot proposition that banned anti-discrimination ordinances, the state has made major strides in LGBTQ rights
The state formally recognized same-sex marriage in 2014 — a year before the Supreme Court decisio that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide
In 2019 Polis signed a law that would ban conversion therap , which seeks to change minors’ sexual orientation or gender identity, and another law that would make it easier for transgender people to update their gender on their birth certificates and other documents Polis, who won re-election earlier this month, was part of the so-called rainbow wav in 2018 — referring to the record number of LGBTQ candidates who ran for office in that year's midterm elections
He is the second out LGBTQ person to be elected governor of a state, after Gov
Kate Brown of Oregon, a Democrat who identifies as bisexual, was first elected in a special election in 2016 During Polis’ first gubernatorial run, his sexuality played only a small role in his run for governor, and he has said in past news interview that he found Colorado voters to be more concerned with kitchen-table issues
Though his campaign focused mainly on delivering more government services while continuing to grow Colorado’s booming economy, he has since become a vocal critic against the rise of attacks on the LGBTQ community in recent years Today Colorado took an important step forward in recognizing our diversity as a strength, Polis told NBC News in an emailed statement when he signed the 2019 bills
These bills truly underscore the idea that Colorado is a state where everyone can be their true selves and live the life they want
Polis also has been critical of anti-LGBTQ laws in Republican-led states, which include bills pushing the prohibition of classroom discussions related to sexual orientation and gender identity Look, words matter.  Laws matter
When a group of people, LGBTQ youth, feel targeted by the words and laws that some politicians espouse, of course, it can increase anxiety, depression, Polis said in an interview with CN earlier this year Polis previously represented Colorado’s 2nd Congressional District for five terms
He first won elected office in 2008 and became, in his words, the first openly gay parent to win a seat in Congress
Polis and his longtime partner — whom he marrie last year, marking the first same-sex marriage for a sitting governor — have two children.  Former Rep
Barney Frank D-Mass, was the firs sitting member of Congress to marry someone of the same sex, in 2012 Before his career in politics, Polis was a tech entrepreneur and amassed a fortune worth nearly $400 millio , according to the Center for Responsive Politics
When asked about his status as one of Congress’ wealthiest members, Polis told NBC News, I’m beholden to no one except voters
Polis founded and sold several startups, including ProFlowers
He was a founding member of the Congressional Blockchain Caucu , a bipartisan group that describes itself as a platform for industry and government to come together to study and understand the implications of blockchain technology
Polis also served six years on the State Board of Education, where he pushed efforts to raise pay for teachers and reduce class sizes for students
In addition, he founded several public charter schools for at-risk youth and served as the superintendent of one of them Polis was born in Boulder in 1975 and grew up in California.  He has two siblings
His parents founded Blue Mountain Arts, a publisher and greeting card company Polis earned a bachelor's degree in politics at Princeton University
In addition to being Colorado's first openly gay governor, he is also the state's first Jewish governor
WASHINGTON — Central to the Republicans' pitch to voters in the midterm elections was a pledge to tackle high inflation and bolster the economy, but a GOP civil war is brewing over what policies could accomplish those goals
Having now secured some power — Republicans will control the House, NBC News projected on Wednesday — the party will have an ownership stake in the economy
In a sign of how much Republicans are going to rely on the economy, former President Donald Trump, in launching his re-election campaign last Tuesday, opted to skip his usual diatribes about the 2020 election and instead tried to make the economy central to his argument about why he should be returned to power
Midterm voters cited inflatio as their top concern, with 1 in 5 saying it had caused them severe economic hardship, according to NBC News exit polls
They gave Republicans higher marks than Democrats on handling the economy While Republicans sought to seize on that economic anxiety during the campaign, most candidates provided few specifics
And Republicans appear to be divided within the party, with some calling for cutting taxes and reducing government spending and others embracing a more populist approach of protectionist trade policies and limiting immigration
The GOP still doesn’t know what its economic policy is in a post-Trump world, said Brian Riedl, who worked for six years as chief economist for Republican Sen
Rob Portman of Ohio and is now a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute
Ten years ago it would have been spending cuts, regulatory reform, free trade and free market policies, and in a post-Trump world, all of those policies are kind of on the outs
So there’s actually a bit of a civil war going on in the GOP around economics
Republicans will be limited in what they can achieve with control of the House because Democrats control the Senate and President Joe Biden will have veto power over legislation passed
Biden said he has no plans to change his approach to the economy, despite voters’ sentiments, making a shift toward a compromise with Republicans on economic policy seemingly unlikely
That may mean that one of the Republicans greatest economic tools will be their ability to block further spending by Democrats in such areas as Covid response or on programs to help lower-income households, including the child tax credit and affordable housing initiatives
Republicans have argued that that type of government spending has contributed to inflation
Large partisan initiatives are off the table, no one can do reconciliation, there’s no path to something large where there’s disagreement, said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum and a former economic adviser to George W.  Bush and John McCain
That means there will be a lot less economic policy
There will be no America Rescue Plan, no Inflation Reduction Act, things like that, and I think that would benefit the economy
If there is a recession, as a number of CEOs and economists have projected, Republican control of the House would likely mean that any stimulus or relief package to help struggling households and small businesses would be significantly smaller than it would be with Democrats in control given Republicans’ vocal opposition to additional spending
Republicans also risk facing the same type of economic blame they levied against Democrats when they face voters again in 2024
Republicans are going to need to deliver on the economy, especially if the economy is worsening and inflation is worsening, said Riedl
The Republicans will be pressured to deliver or at least put out an agenda to contrast themselves with President Biden
Republicans have said they would block additional taxes on corporations, such as a windfall profit tax Biden has suggested placing on oil and gas companies
But passing large tax cuts or making the Trump-era tax cuts permanent, something Republicans promised to do during the campaign, would be much more difficult because of opposition from many Democrats
One thing Republicans will have the power to do with control of the House is launch investigations and hearings into the Biden administration’s handling of the economy.  Rep
Kevin Brady of Texas, the top Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee, said Republicans plan to investigate possible misuse of taxpayer dollars as part of Covid relief efforts, IRS policies and Biden’s expansion of health coverage
Our focus is going to be on pulling the curtain back, giving the public really the right to know how their tax dollars are spent and how their government works, Brady said in an interview on Fox Business Thursday Divided control of Congress will increase the chance of another standoff over the debt ceiling that could cause the government to shut down or the US
to default on its debts for the first time I think voters should expect some unfortunate drama around raising the debt ceiling, and Republicans may try to extract some spending cuts in exchange for raising the debt ceiling, said Michael Strain, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute Inflation showed some signs of moderating earlier this week with consumer price increases easing to 7
7% in October from a year earlier and decreasing from 8
2% in September Gas prices have been a particular concern, with 65% saying the high prices have been a financial hardship for them, according to the NBC exit poll
Energy analysts and investors have said there is little that can be done from a policy standpoint to lower prices, which have been driven higher by a range of factors, including surging demand following the pandemic, Russia’s war in Ukraine and limited refinery capacity
Ultimately, the main factor influencing inflation would be the Federal Reserve, given its ability to raise interest rates; economic policy analysts said there's not much Congress can do even with single party control, at least not in the near term
There is very little that Congress can do, said Holtz-Eakin
They operate on years, and that’s not the right timetable for inflation fighting
You have to be much more nimble
The tools they have are quite clunky
So they just need to be out of that game
That’s the Federal Reserve’s job now.
NEW YORK — A writer who accused former President Donald Trump of rap filed an upgraded lawsuit against him Thursday in New York, minutes after a new state law took effect allowing victims of sexual violence to sue over attacks that occurred decades ago E
Jean Carroll’s lawyer filed the legal papers electronically as the Adult Survivor’s Act temporarily lifted the state’s usual deadlines for suing over sexual assault
She sought unspecified compensatory and punitive damages for pain and suffering, psychological harms, dignity loss and reputation damage Carroll, a longtime advice columnist for Elle magazine, first made the claim in a 2019 boo , saying Trump raped her in the dressing room of a Manhattan luxury department store in 1995 or 1996 Trump responded to the book’s allegations by saying it could never have happened because Carroll was not my type
His remarks led Carroll to file a defamation lawsuit against him, but that lawsuit has been tied up in appeals courts as judges decide whether he is protected from legal claims for comments made while he was president Previously, Carroll had been barred by state law from suing over the alleged rape because too many years had passed since the incident New York’s new law, however, gives sex crime victims who missed deadlines associated with statute of limitations a second chance to file a lawsuit
A window for such suits will open for one year, after which the usual time limits will be reinstated At least hundreds of lawsuits are expected, including many filed by women who say they were assaulted by co-workers, prison guards, medical providers or others Alina Habba, a lawyer for Trump, said in an email Thursday: While I respect and admire individuals that come forward, this case is unfortunately an abuse of the purpose of this Act which creates a terrible precedent and runs the risk of delegitimizing the credibility of actual victims
In her new claims, Carroll maintains that Trump committed battery when he forcibly raped and groped her and that he defamed her when he denied raping her last month Trump said in his statement that Carroll completely made up a story that I met her at the doors of this crowded New York City Department Store and, within minutes, ‘swooned’ her
It is a Hoax and a lie, just like all the other Hoaxes that have been played on me for the past seven years
Carroll’s new ability to sue Trump for rape could help her sidestep a potentially fatal legal flaw in her original defamation case If the courts ultimately hold that Trump’s original disparaging comments about Carroll’s rape allegation were part of his job duties, as president, she would be barred from suing him over those remarks, as federal employees are protected from defamation claims
No such protection would cover things he did prior to becoming president Judge Lewis A
Kaplan, who presides over the defamation lawsuit Carroll filed three years ago, may decide to include the new claims in a trial likely to occur in the spring Trump’s current lawyers said this week that they do not yet know whether they will represent him against the new allegations Carroll’s attorney, Roberta Kaplan, who is not related to the judge, said at a court hearing this week that the new claims should not require much additional gathering of evidence
She already put a copy of the new claims in the original case file last week
Trump and Carroll also have already been deposed In a statement regarding the new lawsuit, Kaplan said her client intends to hold Donald Trump accountable not only for defaming her, but also for sexually assaulting her, which he did years ago in a dressing room at Bergdorf Goodman
Thanksgiving Day was the very first day Ms
Carroll could file under New York law so our complaint was filed with the court shortly after midnight, she added Attorney Michael Madaio, a lawyer for Trump, said at the hearing that the new allegations are significantly different than the original defamation lawsuit and would require an entirely new set of evidence gathering
WASHINGTON — New York Rep
Hakeem Jeffries, the fourth-ranking House Democrat, said Friday that he will run to replace House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as the party's leader after Republicans took back contro of the chamber in last week’s midterm elections His announcement in a letter to colleague came a day after Pelosi said in a powerful floor speec that she is stepping down after a two-decade reign as the top leader of House Democrats If Jeffries is successful, it would represent a historic passing of the torch: Pelosi made history as the first female speaker of the House, while Jeffries, the current Democratic Caucus chairman, would become the first Black leader of a congressional caucus and highest-ranking Black lawmaker on Capitol Hill
If Democrats were to retake control of the House — a real possibility with Republicans having such a narrow majorit — Jeffries would be in line to be the first Black speaker in the nation's history The ascension of the 52-year-old Jeffries to minority leader would also represent generational change
Pelosi and her top two deputies — Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md, and Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, D-S. C
— are all in their 80s and are receiving from within the party for new bloo  in leadership; Hoyer will not seek another leadership post while Clyburn plans to stay on and work with the next generation Reps
Katherine Clark, D-Mass, and Pete Aguilar, D-Calif, are seeking to round out the new leadership team, announcing Friday that they will run for the No.  2 and No.  3 spots in leadership
Clark, 59, announced a bid for Democratic Whip, while Aguilar, 43, is running for Democratic Caucus Chair Pelosi endorsed all three to succeed her leadership team in a statement Friday, saying they are ready and willing to assume this awesome responsibility
Clyburn has also endorsed the three, while Hoyer backed Jeffries for leader on Thursday In the 118th Congress, House Democrats will be led by a trio that reflects our beautiful diversity of our nation, Pelosi said
Chair Jeffries, Assistant Speaker Clark and Vice Chair Aguilar know that, in our Caucus, diversity is our strength and unity is our power
Clyburn, a towering figure in the caucus and close ally of President Joe Biden, called his protege Jeffries absolutely fantastic and signaled support for a full slate of younger set of leaders taking the reins of the Democratic leadership apparatus: Jeffries, Clark, and Aguilar Clyburn said in a letter to colleagues Friday he will run for Assistant Democratic Leader in the next Congress to work alongside our new generation of Democratic Leaders which I hope to be Hakeem Jeffries, Katherine Clark, and Pete Aguilar
Added Hoyer: Well, I think it’s always good for a party to have new blood and new invigoration, new enthusiasm, and new ideas
It's clear that Jeffries is the hands-down favorite for the job
Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif, had explored challenging Jeffries for the top job but dropped his bid Wednesday and instead will look at a potential run for the Senate, according to a source familiar with his planning
No other challengers have emerged Congressional Black Caucus Chair Joyce Beatty, D-Ohio, said Thursday she was confident that the powerful bloc of more than 50 Black lawmakers would line up behind Jeffries I’m very comfortable saying I believe that every member of the Congressional Black Caucus would vote for Hakeem Jeffries, Beatty told reporters Thursday NBC News projected Wednesday that Republicans will control the House for the next two years — but it will be a narrow majority, likely similar to the one Democrats have had since 2021 Before Pelosi made her announcement, Hoyer grinned when asked whether House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif, who is running for speaker, will be able to govern with a small majority We’ll see! Mr.  Ryan and Mr
Boehner found it difficult, Hoyer said Speakers Paul Ryan and John Boehner both had larger majorities than the new one will be This is a developing story

WASHINGTON — As winter temperatures arrive across America,  government officials are bracing for a surge of households unable to pay rising winter heating bills, and dwindling resources available to help cover the costs
For the average household, home heating costs are projecte to rise 28% — on top of double-digit increases last year — driven largely by the disruption to energy markets caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and surging demand for fossil fuels
At the same time, federally funded programs to help low-income households with those bills will have 42% less money this winter after the billions of dollars in Covid stimulus available last winter runs out
The surge in demand and drop in aid is causing concern throughout state and federal governments
In anticipation, the White House has taken a three-prong approach the past year, said an administration official: It has urged oil companies to bolster their stockpiles; make funds available to weatherize homes and make them more energy efficient; and prepare for further releases from the country's petroleum or heating oil reserves
But temperatures are already dropping and the number of households seeking assistance is already on the rise, according to interviews with more than a half dozen officials involved in programs that provide heating assistance
We’re already seeing record numbers of requests this season for utility assistance and really the heating season is just beginning, said Scott Kelly, general secretary of the Massachusetts division of the Salvation Army, an international charitable organization
Our social workers are seeing people who have never needed to ask for help before, so it’s definitely concerning to us
We are very concerned about what the future will hold this heating season
Americans are getting squeezed financially on a number of other fronts with inflation that has shown little signs of abating, and the end to a number of pandemic-era assistance programs, such as the emergency rental assistance funding and the child tax credit that provided hundreds of dollars a month to households before it expired last year
Kelly said the Salvation Army in Massachusetts has received twice as many applications as it did this time last year for its winter heating assistance program, which is aimed at those whose incomes are too high to qualify for federal assistance One of those seeking help this winter is Malonie Bernard
She said her family has been struggling to pay its utility bills with a single income from her fiancé after she left her job at a nursing home during the pandemic to take care of her three children
As the temperatures have dipped into the 20s at night in her hometown of Fitchburg, she has yet to turn on the gas heat in her apartment
Instead, her 9- and 12-year-old children sleep under multiple blankets in heavy pajamas and some nights she uses her body heat to keep her 11-month-old baby warm
She strategically uses space heaters, is sure to use the oven instead of the stove, and times her laundry so the dryer will help warm the house in the evening Each month, Bernard says she has to juggle what bills to pay and what ones to delay as costs have kept rising
Over the summer her electric bill for her seven-room apartment shot up to $700 one month, it had previously never gone above $200, and she’s run up  an unpaid balance of about $1,000
For the winter, she’s anticipating her gas bill will be well above last winter’s of $600 a month — money her family doesn’t have in their budget.  It’s hard
It’s so hard asking for help, but at this point, we have no choice, said Bernard
We feel bad, as if we’re taking it from someone else who really, really needs it
So we try to push it, but I said this year, I don’t think we’re going to be able to push it
In Colorado, the demand for assistance through the federally funded Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, know as LIHEAP, is expected to far outstrip the demand, said Theresa Kullen, who manages the program in Colorado
Kullen said she expects applications to be up 10% this winter on top of the 10% increase they saw last year
We’re very concerned about how much we can do because we know it’s not enough, there’s just not enough money to do what we need to do, said Kullen
With the pandemic relief funds we were able to do so much good, and that money is now gone
And so we are taking a step backwards
But many of those who apply this year will find far less help available to them now that pandemic-era programs have run dry
If Congress doesn’t step in and find some way to help the bottom third of the population pay these bills you’ll see more suffering and they’ll just be poor instead of being working class, and that’s what they’re afraid of, working-class families are afraid of becoming poor, said Mark Wolfe,  executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association
You no longer have what makes you feel lower middle class, you now feel poor, and that’s what’s happening across the board with these inflationary increases, and it’s subtle, it’s quiet.  Congress has allocated $4
8 billion for heating assistance this winter through the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which is $1 billion more than pre-pandemic funding levels
But that will be far less than the $8
3 billion available last year with the addition of Covid relief funds Despite the extra assistance last year, 20 million households are already behind on their utility bills owing a total of $16 billion in overdue payments — an average of $800 per household, according to NEAD
That’s up from $8 billion in utility bill debt at the start of the pandemic Energy costs are on the rise for a range of reasons
Prices for natural gas, the most common form of winter heating in the US, are projected to rise 28% this winter, largely because of increased demand in Europe following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to the Energy Information Administration
The price of heating oil, which is widely used in New England, is expected to be up 27% this winter, and it will cost the average home $1,000 more this winter for heating oil than two years ago, according to NEAD
Heating oil prices are linked to the price of crude oil, which has been increasing as a result of surging demand following the pandemic, limited refinery capacity and uncertainty in the markets from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine In Maine, where the majority of households rely on heating oil, officials have seen a 10% uptick in applications so far this year for its heating assistance program that provided help to 40,000 households last year
Without the Covid stimulus money this year, Maine will provide benefits to around the same number of households, but the amount they receive will be about half of last year’s benefit, said Scott Thistle, a spokesman for MaineHousing
Last winter, we were able to provide about a tank and a half of heating benefit
This year, we’re going to be able to provide them with less than a tank
Maybe if we’re lucky, depending on the price of oil, we’ll get two-thirds or a half a tank so it just doesn’t go as far, said Thistle
The cost of heating oil has been a particular concern for the Biden administration, said the government official
Biden and Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm have been urging oil companies to cut exports of diesel, which is chemically the same as heating oil, to keep more in the US
to build up stockpiles in the Northeast in case there are supply disruptions or colder-than-expected weather that leads to a surge in demand
Heating oil and diesel inventories are at their lowest levels on record for this time of year
The administration is also prepared to tap into the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve, which has about 1 million barrels of heating oil, if necessary, the administration officials said The White House announced earlier this month it was also distributing $9 billion from the Inflation Reduction Act passed earlier this year to help 1
6 million households upgrade their homes to lower energy bills, like providing rebates to purchase a new electric stove, install new insulation or energy efficient appliances
The administration is also distributing $3
16 billion from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to retrofit thousands of low-incomes homes to make them more energy efficient while lowering utility bills, including installing insulation and updating heating and cooling systems Longer term, the Biden administration is looking for ways to expand heat pump use and manufacturing in the US
and develop programs to improve building energy efficiency, according to an announcement earlier this month.
— An exultant Joe Bide sounded every bit like a president hungering for another term, imploring Americans in a speech Tuesday to buy into his vision of a nation making dramatic economic stride against global competition We’re building a better America, Biden said at a plant that makes components for electric vehicles
We just have to keep it going! I know we can
Biden vowed in his half-hour remarks that the US
would expand its manufacturing capacity to levels preventing the sorts of supply-side disruptions that led to shortages of vital products early on during the Covid pandemi
He suggested that China and Europe aren’t necessarily happy about America’s economic ambitions, but he indicated he’s determined to supplant their role as vital links in the worldwide supply chain We’ve proven it’s never, ever been a good bet to bet against America, Biden said at SK Siltron CSS’ gleaming new plant before an appreciative crowd of union workers, elected officials and political supporters.  I mean it
Biden was speaking about the nation, but he might just as well have been talking about himself
Two years ago, anyone betting against Biden’s political prospects would have lost
He upended conventional thinking when he rallied after early defeats in the 2020 Democratic primaries and then went on to win the nomination and oust President Donald Trump
Just this month, Biden’s party defied history in the midterm elections by keeping control of the Senate and staving off heavy losses in the House Still, Biden has been guarded about his own political future, saying he intends to run for re-election in 2024 while stopping short of a definitive announcement Rep
Dan Kildee, a Democrat who represents the district that’s home to the SK Siltron CSS plant and preceded Biden onstage, said in an interview Tuesday that he doesn’t know Biden’s plans for the next election
Asked whether he wants Biden to run, Kildee said: It’s going to be up to him If he decides to run, obviously we’ll support him, he added
These are personal decisions before they’re political ones
Biden was introduced by Kildee and another Democrat who figured prominently in the party’s midterm success story: Michigan Gov.  Gretchen Whitmer
Both Whitmer and Kildee defeated Republican challengers
In the interview, Kildee said Biden’s focus on creating jobs is a winning message that Democrats should carry into 2024 I ran on the agenda that President Biden and I and others promoted — and I won in a Republican-leaning district by more than 10 points, said Kildee, whose congressional race was one of the most competitive in the country
So I think that Michigan is well-positioned to show the rest of the country that when you lean in, have great candidates and policies that make sense, we will be rewarded for it
As a backdrop for the speech, Biden chose a plant that symbolizes the kind of high-tech manufacturing jobs he wants to create
Earlier this year, SK Siltron CSS opened a facility here — about 100 miles northwest of Detroit — as part of a $300 million expansion project
The plant employs about 220 people, and the company expects the number to grow to 300 in the coming years, a spokesman said
Biden touts his industrial policy as a reason for his optimism about US.  economic prospects
In August, he signed into law the CHIPS and Science measure, which sets aside more than $52 billion for semiconductor manufacturing and research
As a condition, recipients of the money are barred from building certain facilities in China and other countries of concer , the White House said But the credit Biden has given himself may be overstated.  US
employment in the manufacturing sector has bee declining since the late 1970 , in part because of the outsourcing of jobs to countries that pay much lower wages Biden has said more than 700,000 manufacturing job have been added since he took office
A PolitiFact repor , however, says that the uptick was evident under Biden’s predecessor and that, in part, it was a product of Trump administration policies
Biden’s visit Tuesday dovetailed neatly with the Democrats’ political ambitions
The plant is in Bay County, which Trump won in both 2016 and 2020
Before the 2016 election, the last Republican presidential candidate to win the county was Ronald Reagan, in his landslide re-election in 1984
Democrats would like to flip the county in 2024, when Michigan will, as ever, loom as a crucial battleground state
A step toward making that happen is to show voters that government policies are helping create jobs, local party officials said Bay County was traditionally a very dependable Democratic county, and that changed when Trump came into being, said Karen Tighe, the county Democratic chairwoman
We’re hoping that President Biden’s visit might entice people to come back to the fold and recognize what his administration is doing for us economically.
WASHINGTON — A federal judge on Monday ordered Riley Williams a 23-year-old right-wing extremist, taken into federal custody after a jury convicted her on six of the eight counts she faced in connection with the Jan
6 attack Williams was found guilty on six counts, but the jury deadlocked on two others, including whether she aided and abetted the theft of a laptop in the office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Williams, a follower of the Groyper movemen , stormed the US.  Capitol on Jan
6, filming rioters breaking into the building, then encouraged members of the mob up a set of stairs toward House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office
She also pushed up against cops and tried to organize other rioters inside the Capitol rotunda Williams had faced a total of eight charges: civil disorder, obstruction of an official proceeding, resisting and impeding officers, aiding and abetting theft of government property, and four misdemeanors Jurors found her guilty of civil disorder, resisting and impeding officers, and four other misdemeanors
But they deadlocked on obstruction of an official proceeding — a charge which would have carried the lengthiest potential sentence — and the charge of aiding and abetting the theft of Pelosi's laptop Judge Amy Berman Jackson said she had no confidence whatsoever that Williams had respect for the rule of law, and granted a government request for Williams to be detained until her sentencing
The defendant will be remanded, Jackson said Williams, who showed little emotion when the jury returned its verdict, was clearly upset by Jackson's decision to lock her up
As she was taken into custody, Williams, who was wearing an outfit that resembled a school uniform, removed her tie and gave her pink purse to her lawyer, who handed it to a male companion in the court gallery
F---, Williams appeared to mouth to the man.  I’m sorry
Most of Williams’ actions weren’t really in dispute
But the government and defense differed on what charges Williams was guilty of
Her defense attorney conceded to the jury that Williams was guilty of two misdemeanor charges she faced, but argued that she did not assist in the theft of Pelosi’s laptop by verbally urging others to take the laptop and telling a man to use gloves when he handled it Prosecutors had extensive evidence of Williams inside the Capitol, including photos that show her pushing other rioters toward a police line and pushing against police officers herself
They also had evidence of her online communications, where she bragged about her activities on Jan
6 After leaving the Capitol that day, Williams climbed on top of a police vehicle parked on the east side of the building Williams' federal public defenders argued that while Williams had distasteful beliefs, she came to D. C
with nothing but her cell phone and her fuzzy zebra ba , and that Williams bragged about her acts because she wanted to be somebod
About 900 people have been arrested in connection with the US
Capitol attack, with hundreds more arrests in the work
The Justice Department is pressing Congress for more fund to help bring Capitol attack cases to fruition
President Joe Biden on Monday called on lawmakers to quickly approve a labor dea that would avert what he called a potentially crippling national rail shutdown as early as Dec
9 The tentative agreement, which Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the House would vote on this week, aims to prevent a freight strike just two weeks before Christmas, but it has divided workers at two of the country’s biggest rail unions Biden urged lawmakers to adopt the tentative deal between railroad workers and operators — without any modifications or delay —  and warned that the economic repercussions of a shutdown of the country's freight rails would devastate the economy As a proud pro-labor President, I am reluctant to override the ratification procedures and the views of those who voted against the agreement, Biden said in a statement
But in this case — where the economic impact of a shutdown would hurt millions of other working people and families — I believe Congress must use its powers to adopt this deal
Congress should get this bill to my desk well in advance of December 9th so we can avoid disruption, he added Shortly after Biden’s statement, Pelosi said the House would soon consider the tentative agreement This week, the House will take up a bill adopting the Tentative Agreement — with no poison pills or changes to the negotiated terms — and send it to the Senate, she said in a statement Asked about the potential rail shutdown, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said at Monday's briefing that Biden has been directly involved in the process and had conversations with members of Congress in case resolving the issue falls to them
The tentative agreement, which was approved by labor and management negotiators in September, was rejected by the 28,000-member SMART-TD union, which represents rail conductors, after one of its divisions voted it down
Meanwhile, members of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen, which represents some 24,000 freight train engineers, voted in favor of the deal The deal would provide a 24% pay raise for rail workers over five years and bump the average pay up to $110,000 by 2024, the Association of American Railroads says However, several unions have signaled their discontent with the proposed contract, worked out with the help of the White House and Labor Secretary Marty Walsh, primarily over its lack of fully paid sick leave and other scheduling requirements Four out of a dozen unions representing rail workers have rejected the tentative agreement, but just one union’s decision to strike would require all 12 to honor it, bringing the system to a halt In a lette to congressional leaders Monday, the US
Chamber of Commerce warned that a stoppage in rail service of any duration would be extremely damaging to American families and our economy
The major lobbying group added that Congress must be prepared to intervene before the Dec
9 deadline to ensure continued rail service if a voluntary agreement isn't reached, a task that it said Congress has taken on 18 times since 1926
Republican leader Kevin McCarthy is strugglin to secure the 218 votes he needs to be elected speaker of the House in January Because voters this month handed the GOP a wafer-thin majority, just a small bloc of conservative rebels could deny the California Republican the speaker’s gavel at the start of the new Congress
Already, several McCarthy foes have declared they will not vote for hi under any circumstance He doesn’t have the votes, said Rep
Andy Biggs, R-Ariz, a leader of the conservative Freedom Caucus
Some of the stages of grief include denial, so there will be some denial and then there’ll be the stage of bargaining where people are trying to figure out … will there be some kind of consensus candidate that emerges
It’s put McCarthy in a precarious position: He’s won his party’s nomination for speake while fighting for his political life In this game of chicken, if the conservatives don’t blink and McCarthy refuses to back down, it could result in a chaotic floor fight with House members taking multiple votes for speaker — something that has not happened in a century Here are other examples throughout history where the speaker's gavel didn't come easy 1855-56: The longest speaker election eve Dec
3, 1855, started like any other opening day of a new Congress
The House was called to order at noon and the chamber moved to the first order of business: electing the speaker But there was no favorite for the job
Twenty-one candidates received votes for speaker on the first ballot, with none getting the majority needed
There was no choice, the Congressional Globe printe that day
The House held three more unsuccessful votes for speaker that day before adjourning just after 2 p
m In the weeks that followed, the House was in gridlock as no candidate could clinch the votes needed
It wasn’t until the 133rd ballot that Rep
Nathaniel Banks of Massachusetts was elected speaker of the House, defeating Rep
William Aiken of South Carolina by a vote of 103 to 100 The date was Feb
2, 185 , two months after the first speaker vote The House concluded business that day by unanimously adopting a resolutio thanking the clerk for presiding during the arduous and protracted contest for Speaker
1923: The last time the speaker vote went multiple ballots When the House gathered on Dec
4, 1923, Frederick Gillett sought re-election as speaker
The Republican from Massachusetts had served in the role since 1919 and his party had maintained control of the chamber But after the first ballot, Gillett did not have the votes needed
Three more votes were held and each time enough Progressive Republicans supported other candidates, blocking Gillett from regaining the gavel Mr
Clerk, it seems entirely evident that no good purpose can be served by having another ballot tonight, Republican leader Nicholas Longworth said on the floo before the chamber adjourned that night At issue were rule changes that Progressive Republicans wanted
For two days, the group refused to budge and on a few ballots, the Democrats’ nominee even led in the tally Longworth eventually struck a deal with the progressives and on the ninth ballot, Gillett was re-elected speaker There have only been 14 instance in congressional history where it took more than two ballots for a nominee to get a majority
The first 13 happened before the Civil War The Civil War established this norm . .
where the parties agreed to air their dirty laundry in caucus but then to coalesce around the party leader, whoever got a majority in caucus, said Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Charles Stewart, co-author of the book Fighting for the Speakership: The House and the Rise of Party Government
2013: Conservatives plot coup against Boehne In 2013, the tea party movement that had swept Ohio Republican John Boehner into the speaker’s office turned on Boehner himself A band of 20 conservative rebels — furious that Boehner had ousted some of them from committees and cut a fiscal deal that raised taxes on the wealthy — huddled in a Capitol Hill apartment the night before the speaker’s vote and plotted a coup against their own leader, according to author Tim Alberta's book, American Carnage
Among those in the room were Reps
Thomas Massie, R-Ky, Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, and Tim Huelskamp, R-Kansas, Alberta writes
Republicans had won 234 seats in the 2012 election; if 17 Republicans opposed Boehner, they argued, conservatives could prevent him from getting the 218 votes he needed to remain speaker But some suspected there were Boehner spies in the room, and the conservatives began pointing fingers at each other, according to Alberta
Labrador said they actually needed to secure 30 dissenters because Boehner would surely be able to flip some of those no votes, telling the group, We need 30 to get to 17 because half of the people in this room are going to cave tomorrow.  Labrador was right
When their names were called on the House floor the next day, some involved in the plot got cold feet and did not vote, voted present or cast their ballot for Boehner
In the end, only 12 Republicans refused to support Boehner
Two years later, Boehner suffered 25 GOP defections in the speaker vote — the largest number of defections in 100 years — but he would easily win the speaker’s gavel with 216 votes due to a number of members missing the vote; Democrats had attended the funeral of former New York Gov
Mario Cuomo and several other lawmakers couldn’t get to Washington due to bad weather In September 2015, Boehner announced his resignation, after a conservative rabble-rouser, Rep
Mark Meadows, filed a motion to vacate the chair that would have forced yet another floor vote on the unpopular speaker Typically, when a party retakes the majority, the minority leader will have a clear path to the speakership
But in 2018, after 16 years in power, Nancy Pelosi faced a rump rebellion from a new generation of Democrats who wanted her to step aside The week of Thanksgiving that year, 16 rebels in Pelosi’s Democratic caucus signed a lette announcing their opposition to her as speaker
Other Democrats who did not sign contemplated challenging Pelosi for the job As we head toward the 116th Congress and reclaim our Democratic majority, we believe more strongly than ever that the time has come for new leadership in our caucus, wrote the 16 Democrats, including Reps
Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, Kathleen Rice, D-N
Y, and Seth Moulton, D-Mass If her foes held the line, they would have enough votes to block her on the House floor
But Pelosi, who calls herself a master legislator and vote counter, was only getting started The first female speaker of the House began picking off her opponents one by one
Pelosi huddled in her office with one potential challenger, Rep.  Marcia Fudge
The Ohio Democrat would later endorse Pelos and be named chair of a subcommittee overseeing elections
Pelosi also won ove Rep.  Brian Higgins, D-N
Y, by vowing to prioritize his Medicare proposal and work with him on infrastructure And she secured support from a handful of holdouts, including Rep
Ryan, who challenged her in 2016, by agreeing to a deal on term limit for the party’s top leaders In the end, 15 Democrats broke with Pelosi: a dozen voted for other people and three voted present
But it wasn’t enough to block her from serving a second time as speaker of the House Every two years, we gather in this chamber for a sacred ritual, she said upon accepting the gavel
Under the dome of this temple of democracy, the Capitol of the United States, we renew the great American experiment.
Three House Democrats swiftly pushed back at Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy's threat to strip them of their committee assignments if he is elected speaker
After Republicans narrowly won control of the Hous in the midterm elections, McCarthy this weekend doubled down on his pledge to remov several prominent House Democrats from their committee assignments if he becomes speaker
McCarthy said he would not allow Rep
Ilhan Omar of Minnesota to serve on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Reps
Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell, both of California, on the House Intelligence Committee In twee posted Saturday alongside a video clip, McCarthy said that he would keep his promise to remove Omar based on her repeated antisemitic and anti-American remarks
He made similar comments during an appearance on Fox News on Sunday Omar issued a blistering statemen Monday in response to McCarthy’s remarks, taking aim at Republicans for making it their mission to use fear, xenophobia, Islamophobia and racism to target me on the House Floor and through millions of dollars of campaign ads
Omar pointed to McCarthy’s support of Rep.  Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga
During an interview with CN this month, McCarthy said he would reinstate the far-right lawmaker’s committee assignments if he becomes speaker
Greene was stripped of her assignments last year in light of incendiary remarks musing about the execution of Democratic lawmakers McCarthy’s effort to repeatedly single me out for scorn and hatred— including threatening to strip me from my committee — does nothing to address the issues our constituents deal with
It does nothing to address inflation, health care, or solve the climate crisis, Omar said What it does is gin up fear and hate against Somali-Americans and anyone who shares my identity, and further divide us along racial and ethnic lines, she continued
It is a continuation of a sustained campaign against Muslim and African voices, people his party have been trying to ban since Donald Trump first ran for office
Schiff similarly took aim at McCarthy in an interview Sunday with ABC News, calling him a very weak leader of the GOP conference who will adhere to Greene’s wishes He will adhere to the wishes of the lowest common denominator, Schiff said
And if that lowest common denominator wants to remove people from committees, that’s what they’ll do
It’s going to be chaos with Republican leadership, Schiff added
Asked by NBC News about his response to McCarthy’s vow, Swalwell said, Talk to me if Kevin McCarthy becomes speaker
McCarthy initially made his pledge to boot Schiff, Swalwell and Omar from their committee assignments if the GOP retakes the House in an interview with Breitbart News in January
All three Democratic lawmakers are vocal critics of former President Donald Trump and have repeatedl been targeted by conservatives Schiff, a former prosecutor, served a the lead House manage during Trump’s first impeachment trial and is a member of the Jan.  6 committee
Swalwell, also a former prosecutor, was an impeachment manager during Trump's second impeachment trial Removing Democrats from their committee assignments would require a vote of a majority of the House
Obtaining benefits through the Department of Veterans Affairs has been disproportionately more difficult for Black Americans for decades, a federal lawsuit filed Monda alleges The results of VA’s racial discrimination has been to deny countless meritorious applications by Black veterans, depriving them and their families of care and support that their faithful service has earned, the lawsuit reads Filed in federal court by Yale Law School’s Veterans Legal Services Clinic on behalf of Conley Monk Jr, a Vietnam War veteran, the suit claims Monk was repeatedly denied home loan, education and medical benefits because he is Black Monk is far from alone, the filing alleges
According to VA records obtained through Freedom of Information Act litigation brought by the National Veterans Council for Legal Redress, of which Monk is the co-founder and director, and the Black Veterans Project, the average denial rate for disability compensation was 5
3% higher for Black veterans than their white counterparts between 2001 and 2020
And the racial disparity for average acceptance rates was even higher —  6
8% They failed to redress longstanding, pervasive race discrimination and disparate impacts of which they knew or should have known, the suit reads Adam Henderson, one of the Yale Law School student interns working on the case, said their legal team has three goals: obtaining reparations for Monk, getting Veterans Affairs to listen, and creating a better legal pathway for other Black veterans to get justice We hope that going forward, there won’t be another generation of veterans who are subjected to the same system, Henderson said In a statement, Veterans Affairs press secretary Terrence Hayes acknowledged the unacceptable disparities in both VA benefits decisions and military discharge status due to racism — adding that the department is studying the role race plays in benefits decisions and that results will be published as soon as they are available We are actively working to right these wrongs, he said
We are taking steps to ensure that our claims process combats institutional racism, rather than perpetuating it
At a press conference Monday after the lawsuit was filed in the US
District Court for the District of Connecticut, Sen
Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn, spoke to the disproportionate denial of benefits for Black veterans and called for answers We know the results, he said
We want to know the reason why
Both Henderson, who is Black, and Mike Sullivan, another Yale Law School student intern working with the clinic on Monk’s case, said they each found special meaning in helping Monk
It’s really like serving a brother, said Sullivan, who enlisted in the Marine Corps after high school Henderson, though, said that there’s still much to be done This is the tip of the iceberg, he said.  The clinic and Mr
Monk will continue to fight every step of the way.
WASHINGTON — Jack Smith, the newly named special counsel in the Trump investigation , most recently served as the chief prosecutor for the special court in The Hague, where he investigated war crime committed during the Kosovo War
Before The Hague, Smith served as the vice president of litigation for the Hospital Corporation of America, the nation’s largest nongovernmental health care provider Smith began his prosecutorial career in 1994 as an assistant district attorney with the New York County District Attorney’s Office
In 1999, he became an assistant US
attorney for the Eastern District of New York, where he worked for nine years prosecuting issues such as gang murders of police officers as well as civil rights violations, according to a bio from the Justice Department From 2008 to 2010, Smith worked at the International Criminal Cour where he oversaw war crimes investigations In 2010, Smith returned to the Justice Department where he worked as chief of the Public Integrity Section, overseeing public corruption and elections-related investigations
In 2015, he served as the first assistant US
attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee before becoming the acting United States attorney Attorney General Merrick Garland said Friday that Smith would be returning to the US
from his position at The Hague, and would begin his role as special counsel immediately
WASHINGTON — Members of the far-right Oath Keepers organization seized the opportunity to storm the US.  Capitol on Jan
6 as part of a broader criminal conspiracy to oppose the peaceful transfer of power, a Justice Department prosecutor told jurors during closing arguments in their seditious conspiracy trial on Friday
For these defendants, the attack on the Capitol was a means to an end, Assistant US
Attorney Kathryn Rakoczy told jurors
The defendants were driven by a sense of entitlement that led to frustration followed by rage and then violence, Rakoczy said
Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhode and four others affiliated with the far-right organization are facing charges of seditious conspiracy, a rarely used statute that makes it unlawful to conspire against the authority of the government Over the course of a seven-week trial which began with opening arguments on Oct
, jurors heard violent rhetoric aimed at Democrats and the group's desire to keep former President Donald Trump in office
Prosecutors did not present evidence that there was a pre-formed plan to storm the Capitol but argued that the alleged co-conspirators entered into an agreement to oppose the transfer of power from Trump to President Joe Biden Closing arguments are expected to continue into Monday when the jury will begin deliberating their verdict
Rhodes testified during the tria , as did co-defendants Thomas Caldwel and Jessica Watkins
Kelly Meggs and Kenneth Harrelson did not take the stand Prosecutors relied on testimony from Jason Dola and Graydon Youn as well as Terry Cumming , who told jurors that the group stored guns at a Virginia hotel as part of a quick reaction force (QRF) that Cummings said featured more weapons than he'd seen since he was in the US.  military
James Lee Bright, an attorney for Rhodes, repeatedly told the jury that the government has presented no evidence to back up what he called The Big 3: No plan to storm the Capitol
No plan to breach the rotunda
No plan to stop the certification or delay the certification of the election
Bright told jurors there was not evidence of a meeting of the minds on seditious conspiracy
We’ve had 50 witnesses in this case, not one person has testified to you there was a plan, Bright said.  Not one
If Rhodes truly wanted to take over the Capitol, Bright argued, he would have called in the QRF after the building's doors were breached and sent in some of his best fighters, like Michael Green , he said
You’re either the Keystone Cops of insurrectionists or there was no insurrection, Bright said Oath Keepers were upset about the results of the 2020 election, but them venting their frustrations to each other doesn’t constitute a conspiracy, Bright argued It was heated rhetoric, he said.  Horribly heated rhetoric.  Bombast.  Inappropriate
But that is not indicative of an agreement
Rakoczy, arguing for the government, reminded jurors that Rhodes had started talking about civil war just after the 2020 election ‘We are not getting through this without a civil war
Prepare your mind body and spirit’ — those were the words of Stewart Rhodes on November 5, 2020, two days after the presidential election, she said
Defendant Rhodes called for war with all of its horrors and all of its violence to oppose the results of a presidential election
Evidence showed that the defendants agreed to use any means necessary, up to and including force, to stop the lawful transfer of presidential power, she said.  That is a conspiracy
The attack on the Capitol on Jan
6 was just a means to an end in support of their larger goal of overturning the election results and stopping Joe Biden from becoming president, she argued Mr
Rhodes told you in his own words he was prepared to start a rebellion the day that president Biden took office, Rakoczy said, referring back to Rhodes’ testimony in his own defense
Rakoczy also focused on calls for violence and rebellion in messages sent by the defendants, saying, that’s just what they put in writing
The defendants surely discussed more precise plans over the phone and during in-person meetings, she said About 900 people have been arrested in connection with the Jan
6 attack on the US
Capitol, and hundreds more arrest are in the works
WASHINGTON — A Donald Trump fan who was convicted on all counts after telling jurors that he thought he was  following presidential order  when he stole a liquor bottle and a coat rack from the US.  Capitol on Jan
6 was sentenced to three years in federal prison on Friday Dustin Thompson, a college-educated Ohio man who testified that he believed Trump's lies about the 2020 election, was convicte on six charges in April after he told jurors he was seeking Trump's respect and approval on Jan.  6
His prior attorney argued that Trump authorize  the attack on the Capitol, and took advantage of vulnerable people like his client You didn't love America that day, Senior US.  District Judge Reggie B
Walton told Thompson while sentencing him on Friday
Walton said he didn't understand how people can be gullible enough to accept a lie and act on that lie
Thompson was sentenced to 36 months in federal prison, and will get credit for the roughly seven months he's served since he was convicted, meaning he's still got more than two years to spend behind bars Thompson's new lawyer sai in a filin ahead of his sentencing that Thompson was working with an individual that specializes in cult deprograming and was confronted with facts about the 'stolen election' conspiracy theory among others and how psychological manipulation is used to indoctrinate the followers of a conspiracy
About 900 people have been arrested as a part of the sprawling investigatio into the attack on the US
Capitol, with hundred more arrest still in the works
A top GOP official in Wisconsin who said former President Donald Trump called to urge him to overturn the state’s 2020 election results is scheduled to sit for a deposition Wednesday with the House panel investigating the Jan
6 riot, two people familiar with the matter said
Robin Vo , the speaker of Wisconsin’s state Assembly, was subpoenae by the committee this year after he publicly revealed that Trump called him 20 months after the election to demand that he dismiss the results
President Joe Biden won the battleground stat by about 20,000 votes Trump called after the Wisconsin Supreme Court issued a ruling that restricted the us of absentee ballot drop boxe in future elections
Trump tried to convince Vos that the ruling should apply retroactively, which Vos told him was not possible Vos' refusal to try to throw out the election results led Trump to campaign against his re-election
Vos, who is the longest-serving speaker in Wisconsin history, ultimatel prevailed in his primary, but by only 3 percentage points — the smallest margin in his political career
He was recently re-elected as speaker Wisconsin Democrats previously criticized Vos for appropriating close to $700,000 to investigate the state’s 2020 election results
The investigation turned up no evidence of widespread fraud, and Vos later said the election had not been stolen A spokesperson for the Jan
6 committee declined to comment on Vos’ scheduled appearance
NBC News has asked Vos for comment A federal judge on Monday rejected Trump’s argumen that he has absolute immunity in response to a lawsuit alleging he committed civil rights violations in his attempts to challenge the 2020 presidential election results The House committee has held a series of interviews with former Trump officials in recent weeks Kellyanne Conway, who was a senior counselor to Trump from the beginning of his term through August 2020, met with the panel for nearly five hour Monday On Tuesday, former deputy White House chief of staff Tony Ornat was set to appea for an interview before the committee, a person familiar with the panel’s plans said The committee is expected soon to release a final repor detailing the findings of its investigation
The panel is not expected to continue beyond January, when Republicans take control of the House
Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs sued a Republican-controlled county Monday after it refused to certify its election results by the state's statutory deadline
The lawsuit, filed in Arizona Superior Court, aims to compel the Cochise County Board of Supervisors to certify the county's results from the Nov.  8 election
The deadline for county certification is Monday Officials in Cochise, one of 15 counties in the state, voted earlier in the day against certifying its election results
The county previously postponed certification at a Nov
18 meeting Under state law, Arizona is supposed to certify its results by Dec
8 — with or without certification from all of the counties Absent this Court’s intervention, the Secretary will have no choice but to complete the statewide canvass by December 8 without Cochise County’s votes included, the lawsuit states
Thus, the Board’s inaction not only violates the plain language of the statute, but also undermines a basic tenet of free and fair elections in this state: ensuring that every Arizonan’s voice is heard
The board voted 2-1 Monday to further delay its certification until Friday The lone Democrat on the board, Ann English, urged her GOP colleagues to take action There is no reason for us to delay, English told Vice Chair Peggy Judd and Tom Crosby We have been presented materials that was asked for at the last meeting from both sides, and I feel that you both have the information necessary in order to make this decision, she added NBC News has asked Judd and Crosby for comment In a statement earlier Monday, a spokesperson for Hobbs warned that she would use all available legal remedies to compel counties to comply with state law, which requires that county election results be certified by Nov
28 The spokesperson, Sophia Solis, added that if the court failed to intervene, Hobbs will have no choice but to complete the statewide canvass by Dec
8 without Cochise County’s votes Hobbs will be the state's next governor after she defeated Trump-backed Kari Lak , a prominent election denier who has refused to conced the race
Voters in Cochise County largely favored Lake over Hobbs in the November election Cochise County is the only county in the state that refused to certify its results The state’s most populous county, Maricopa, the jurisdiction that was at the center of a partisan review over its 2020 election results, certified November's results amid backlash at a public meetin Monday This was not a perfect election, but it was safe and secure
The votes have been counted accurately, Bill Gates, the GOP chairman of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors, said before the vote to certify the election
Attorneys for former President Donald Trump on Tuesday asked a federal judge in Florida to unseal the probable cause affidavit outlining the Justice Department's criminal investigation into their client
Trump's lawyers filed the motion with Judge Aileen Cannon just hours before a federal appeals court heard arguments that Trump's underlying case demanding access to items that federal agents seized from his Mar-a-Lago resort be dismissed redacted versio of the search warrant affidavit was made public in late August
Justice Department officials contended that releasing any more information about their evidence and witnesses in the case could jeopardize their ongoing criminal investigation and the safety of witnesses If disclosed, the affidavit would serve as a roadmap to the government’s ongoing investigation, providing specific details about its direction and likely course, in a manner that is highly likely to compromise future investigative steps, prosecutors said in an August court filing In their court filing Tuesday, Trump's attorneys said they and their client must be able to review the document to know whether their rights to reasonable search and seizure were violated, and brushed aside the government's concerns The entire matter has played out in the media, overwhelmingly because of the Government’s leaks
There is no concern regarding disclosure of the scope and direction of the investigation; nor is there any prospect of witness intimidation, the filing said, because the unredacted document wouldn't be shared publicly A spokesperson for the Justice Department declined to comment
Trump has been accused of witness tampering and intimidation before
The House committee investigating the Jan
6 riot at the US
Capitol suggested earlier this year that Trump allies had been trying to influence witnesse in their probe, and as president, Trump was accused of trying t intimidate witnesses testifying in his first impeachment trial, as well as trying to influence witnesse in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, including by dangling the prospect of a presidential pardon While Trump publicly called for the affidavit to be unsealed in August, the Tuesday filing was the first time his lawyers formally asked Cannon to unseal the unredacted version The magistrate judge who signed off on the search warrant, Bruce Reinhart, released a redacted version of the affidavit in late August that kept under wraps the information the government was concerned about becoming public
It showed that Trump had been hoarding classified documents since he left the White House in Jan.  2021
The request to Cannon came shortly before lawyers for Trump and the Justice Department faced off over Trump's lawsuit in the 11th US
Circuit Court of Appeals The Justice Department asked the appeals court to dismiss Cannon's order appointing a special master in the case which blocked investigators from using thousands of documents recovered in their Aug
8 search as part of their probe until the review is done
Lawyers for DOJ argued a narrower appeal from the same order earlier this year, charging the judge overstepped when she barred the feds from reviewing classified documents seized in the search until the special master review was completed
The appeals court ruled in DOJ's favor in September The three-judge panel that heard the case Tuesday seemed highly skeptical of Trump's arguments to allow the case to proceed, noting that a ruling in his favor could open the floodgates for similar challenges from anyone who's the target of a federal investigation
One of the judges also seemed unimpressed by Trump lawyer Jim Trusty's complaint that extraordinary action was needed in this case because federal investigators had gathered up personal items like pictures of singer Celine Dion while they were executing a search warrant for government documents This is a situation where a political rival has been subjected to a search warrant where thousands of personal materials have been taken, Trusty said
One of the judges responded that the search warrant was for classified documents and boxes and other items that are intermingled with them
I don’t think it’s necessarily the fault of the government if someone has intermingled classified documents and all kinds of personal property
If the appeals court were to grant the government's bid to dismiss the underlying challenge, that would effectively make the Trump motion moot, since it is a part of that case.
Appearing with Republicans in El Paso, Texas, House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy on Tuesday called on Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorka to resign for failing to secure the southern border If Mayorkas does not resign, McCarthy warned, House Republicans will investigate him and his department to determine whether to launch impeachment proceedings Specifically, McCarthy pointed to recent suicides of Border Patrol agents; the Biden administration’s decision to end the Remain in Mexico polic , a Trump-era program designed to restrict immigration at the southern border; and Biden’s efforts to end Title 4 , a Trump-era Covid policy that allowed authorities to limit asylum-seekers from crossing the border His actions have produced the greatest wave of illegal immigration in recorded history
Our country may never recover from Secretary Mayorkas’s dereliction of duty, said McCarthy, flanked by fellow House Republicans
This is why today I am calling on the secretary to resign
He cannot and must not remain in that position If Secretary Mayorkas does not resign, McCarthy continued, House Republicans will investigate every order, every action and every failure, [and] will determine whether we can begin impeachment inquiry
A spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security responded in a statement later Wednesday, saying, Secretary Mayorkas is proud to advance the noble mission of this Department, support its extraordinary workforce, and serve the American people
The Department will continue our work to enforce our laws and secure our border, while building a safe, orderly, and humane immigration system
Members of Congress can do better than point the finger at someone else; they should come to the table and work on solutions for our broken system and outdated laws, which have not been overhauled in over 40 years, the spokesman said McCarthy's remarks come as he struggles to lock u support from the 218 Republicans he needs to win the vote for speake on the House floor on Jan
3 Many conservatives who are withholding support are insisting that House Republicans impeach Mayorka when they take power next year
McCarthy’s remarks Tuesday were seen as part of his efforts to shore up support from some of those recalcitrant conservatives
A White House spokesman noted in a tweet that McCarthy had traveled to the border and called for Mayorkas' resignation in April, to no avail McCarthy went to the border, staged a political stunt devoid of any solutions, and threatened to impeach Sec.  Mayorkas
In April, White House spokesman Ian Sams said in a twee He is literally dusting off old news, instead of learning lessons from House Rs’ historic midterm underperformance.
The Biden administration announced Tuesday that it would extend the payment pause on federal student loans, as President Joe Biden’s debt cancellatio plan remains blocked in cour The payment pause, which was previously set to expire in January, will be extended until June 30 or until the litigation is resolved — whichever comes first
If the litigation has not been resolved by June 30, payments will resume 60 days after that I’m completely confident that my plan is legal, Biden said in a video announcemen
But it isn’t fair to ask tens of millions of borrowers eligible for relief to resume their student debt payments while the courts consider the lawsuit
Biden in August announced he would cancel up to $20,000 in debt per eligible borrower, but the move was quickly met with legal challenges The Biden administration last week asked the Supreme Cour to reinstate the loan forgiveness plan after it had been blocked by a federal appeals court Biden said that the new June 30 deadline for student loan payments to resume would give the Supreme Court enough time to hear the case In a filing with the Supreme Court Wednesday, a group of Republican-led states challenging the debt cancellation argued the extension means there's no reason for the high court to immediately reinstate the plan, which they argue is unlawful
Federal student loan holders have not been required to make payments since March 2020, when President Donald Trum signed the CARES Ac , which paused payments through September 2020 and stopped interest from accruing to alleviate the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic Trump later took executive actio to extend the deferral period through January 2021
Biden has issued six more extensions since taking office The moratorium does not apply to borrowers with privately held loans About 45 million people in the US.  have student debt
The Federal Reserv estimated that in the third quarter of 2022, people owed more than $1
7 trillion in student loans The Biden administration has expressed confidence that it will prevail in court, but officials have been unable to say what other policies the White House will pursue to alleviate student debt should the courts reject Biden’s cancellation plan
The Georgia Supreme Court on Wednesday denied the state Republican Party's bid to block early votin in the state's hotly contested Senate runof from moving forward Saturday
The brief unanimous rulin by the state's high cour upheld last week's decision by a Fulton County judge blocking a directive from Georgia's secretary of state prohibiting counties from voting on the Saturday after Thanksgiving Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, had argued that changes to Georgia voting laws meant that there could be no early voting Nov
26, the only Saturday when it would have been possible for Georgians to cast an early vote in the Dec
6 runoff election between Democratic Sen
Raphael Warnock and Republican Herschel Walker Early voting is required to be available statewide Monday through Friday of next week The Court finds that the absence of the Saturday vote will irreparably harm the Plaintiffs, their members, and constituents, and their preferred runoff candidate, Judge Thomas A
Cox wrote in a rulin last Friday The state Republican Party appealed the decision, arguing it was allowing illegal advance voting
The dispute centered on a provision of Senate Bill 20 , signed by Republican Gov
Brian Kemp in March 2021, which stipulates that early in-person voting must not be held on any Saturday that follows a public or legal holiday on the preceding Thursday or Friday
Raffensperger contended that meant there could be no early in-person voting Nov
26, the Saturday following Thanksgiving
Attorneys for the Democrats and Warnock's campaign argued the section of the law Raffensperger cited applied to primaries and general elections, but not to runoff elections
Cox agreed In a joint statement Wednesday, the Warnock campaign, the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee and the state Democratic Party called the state Supreme Court ruling a victory for every Georgia voter
Early voting opened in at least on of the state's 159 counties Tuesday
In a court filin , Democrats said at least 19 counties with a total of more than 4 million residents were planning on offering early voting Saturday
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Cour on Tuesday rejected former President Donald Trump's last-ditch plea to bloc the release of his tax records to House Democrats, paving the way for their possible disclosure to the lawmakers The decision by the court in a brief order noting no dissenting votes means the committee can try to access the documents before Republicans take over the House in January
The committee, however, has not said how quickly it expects to get the documents
Upon taking control, Republicans are expected to withdraw the request Earlier this month, Chief Justice John Roberts temporarily blocked the Ways and Means panel from accessing Trump’s tax record while the court decided how to act on Trump’s request Trump, who, unlike other recent presidents, refused to make his tax returns public amid scrutiny of his business affairs, turned to the justices after an appeals court in Washington refused to intervene
The court has recently rejected similar requests from Trump In response to the ruling, the former president lashed out that the high court in a pos to his Truth Social account early Wednesday
Trump, who appointed three conservative justices to the high court, complained that it has always ruled against him and refused to overturn the 2020 election results The Supreme Court has lost its honor, prestige, and standing, &amp; has become nothing more than a political body, with our Country paying the price, Trump wrote The former president's lawyers contested the House Ways and Means Committee’s assertion that it needed the information to probe how the IRS conducts the auditing process for presidents, saying it did not stand up to scrutiny House Democrats, as well as the Biden administration, urged the court to reject Trump's request, saying their demand for the tax documents reflected a valid legislative purpose The US
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit decline last month to reconsider a three-judge panel’s ruling in August that the Ways and Means Committee could obtain the tax returns Tax returns are confidential under federal law, but there are some exceptions, one of which allows the chairman of the committee to request them House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif, praised the Supreme Court's commonsense decision, which she said upholds our Democracy, the rule of law and the Congress’ ability to execute its legislative and oversight responsibilities
These documents are vital to meeting the House’s Constitutional mandate: guarding the public interest, defending our national security and holding our public officials to account, Pelosi said
The House looks forward to promptly receiving and reviewing these documents, she said in a statemen , calling on Congress to enact legislation requiring Presidents and candidates for President to disclose their tax returns
The legal battle began in April 2019, when Rep
Richard Neal, D-Mass, the panel's chairman, asked for Trump’s returns and those of related business entities
He said he sought the information as part of the committee’s inquiries into whether tax law concerning presidents should be amended The Treasury Department, then under Trump’s control, refused to comply, saying Neal did not have a valid purpose, prompting the committee to sue Following the election of President Joe Biden, the Treasury Department said that it would comply last year, but Trump himself objected
A federal judge ruled in December that the request was lawful, prompting Trump to appeal Among other things, Trump claims not just that the request is invalid, but also that the statute is unconstitutional because it is overly broad, and that the Biden administration’s decision to disclose the materials was an unconstitutional form of retaliation that violates Trump’s First Amendment rights Democrats have been calling for Trump to release his tax returns ever since the 2016 presidential campaign
While no law requires presidential candidates to release their tax returns, it has become the norm for both Democrats and Republicans to do so Neal said the court victory rises above politics, and the Committee will now conduct the oversight that we’ve sought for the last three and a half years
The committee's top Republican, Kevin Brady of Texas, said the high court has no idea what their inaction unleashes
By effectively granting the majority party in either chamber of Congress nearly unlimited power to target and make public the tax returns of political enemies — political figures, private citizens, or even justices of the Supreme Court themselves —they are opening a dangerous new political battleground where no citizen is safe
No party in Congress should hold this dangerous power, Brady said
In a separate case, the Trump Organization — Trump’s closely held company — is on trial over allegations it was involved in a 15-year schem to compensate top executives off the books to help them evade taxes Trump faces other legal battles, including in the House committee’s investigation into the Jan
6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by his supporters
The committee has issued a subpoena seeking Trump’s testimon , calling for him to testify last week at the Capitol or by videoconference.  He did not appear
Although the Supreme Court has a 6-3 conservative majority, including three justices he appointed, Trump has not recently fared well in other such emergency applications, including his attempt to prevent White House documents from being handed over to the House Jan
6 committe and his bid to avoid disclosing his financial records to prosecutors in New Yor
Most recently, the court last month rejecte Trump’s request that a special master be allowed to review classified papers seized from his Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach, Florida
President Joe Biden’s top political supporters complained of being shut out for most of his first two years in the White House, and many of them groused about the perceived lack of gratitude from a team whose victory they helped bankroll
But that’s all changing With Biden and party officials looking toward the 2024 presidential election — and on the heels of legislative wins and better-than-expected midterm results — the same White House that cold-shouldered its high rollers is now warming to them
Is it any surprise? Alan Kessler, a longtime Philadelphia-area fundraiser, said.  We’re over the midterms
Guess what election is next? Quite frankly, I think they’re doing the right thing
The White House is cranking up its donor courtship, a strategy that’s most evident in a shower of social invitations for big-dollar supporters: this week’s state dinner for French President Emmanuel Macron, the arrival and lighting of the national Christmas tree, Biden’s Christmas parties and Vice President Kamala Harris’ Hanukkah celebration among them
They’re offering more policy briefings to longtime supporters, Zoom calls with top administration officials and White House tours, too The donors have taken notice and already are praising the change from a team they long complained was unavailable to answer questions in darker political moments for Biden, according to interviews with more than 20 peopl who have contributed to Biden, raised money for him or helped secure White House invitations for his supporters
An expanded social calendar means they are getting down the list a little further, in terms of who gets face time with the president, said one White House official
And that could pay dividends for Biden if he runs in 2024 Donor maintenance is a critical step for the administration should Biden seek re-election and even beyond, when he will likely want to raise hundreds of millions of dollars for a presidential library
Despite all of the Biden administration’s victories and the absence of a midterm shellacking, the president’s poll numbers remain underwater, with an NBC poll taken just before the Nov
8 election showing him at 44
Perhaps a more ominous sign, however, is that two-thirds of midterm voters surveyed in an NBC exit poll said they did not want Biden to run for re-election All of a sudden, said Alan Patricof, a longtime Democratic fundraiser, things start changing when we get close to the next election
On Thursday, when Macron arrives at the White House for his official state visit, Biden campaign supporters and fundraisers will be among a large crowd invited to watch the ceremony on the White House lawn
It is the first state dinner Biden has hosted since entering office in 2021
It will honor Macron and celebrate the United States’ long-standing ties with France
State dinners have been a hallmark of the US
presidency dating back to 1874, but Covid had curbed the administration’s ability to host such events until now
For one of the first times in this administration, the president’s supporters — some at least — will be invited, according to a person familiar with the White House’s view of the matter
And that, in essence, is a return to a degree of normal that you see in any administration
People close to the White House concede that Biden’s political operation has left longtime Democratic fundraisers feeling marginalized and unappreciated
They point to the pandemic as the main reason Biden has shunned the outreach that donors see as a reward for past labors and an incentive to reel in more campaign money ahead of the 2024 election
The source with knowledge of the White House thinking, granted anonymity to speak freely, noted the pandemic had proved incredibly challenging as it relates to gathering indoors in these extraordinary spaces
Now that we’re safely testing, we’re able to do it again
I do believe that there has been a much greater number of events where we’re able to bring people together again
That’s always been the vision of the first lady and the president
It’s just a matter of the right timing
Among those invited to the state dinner on Macron’s behalf Thursday night is Christopher Korge, chairman of the Democratic National Committee’s finance committee, people familiar with the planning said This is the hottest ticket in town; everyone wants to go, the person familiar with the White House’s view of its donor outreach said In the past, White Houses have rewarded donors with big-ticket perks, some of which have engendered controversies, like overnight stays in the Lincoln Bedroom during Bill Clinton’s presidency
Yet some donors also make the point that Biden has never been as attentive to the buck-raking class as Clinton, the gold standard of the modern presidency Biden is less concerned, less interested, less involved, than Clinton or former President Barack Obama, Patricof said
I’ve not been to the White House since he’s been elected
It’s not like I’m sitting here waiting
But there seems to be much less interaction with the donor community than I’ve seen in the past
This year, Biden donors are enthralled with something far more simple: The White House throwing open its doors for the holiday season with parties and tours scheduled throughout December
And some who talked to NBC News recognized their worth isn't what it once was, noting that Biden managed to haul in big bucks online from small donors The $500,000 people like me, we’re not going to be players in 2024, said Dick Harpootlian, a longtime Democratic donor and South Carolina state senator For the White House, the shift is an acceleration of a courtship campaign that began more modestly before the midterm elections
As Biden racked up a handful of major legislative victories this year — including laws aimed at combating climate change and China’s edge in semiconductor manufacturing — the White House invited a broad array of supporters to celebrate at bill-signing ceremonies
Invites also went out to a White House Elton John concert Biden’s defenders have long said the White House was closed to many of the president’s allies because he took office during a period of much greater sensitivity to the Covid-19 pandemic
Amid concerns about the omicron variant last year, the White House was forced to abandon plans for a more full set of holiday parties
But there’s no such limitation this year They are inviting just an obscene number of people to December events, one Democratic official said The new level of TLC is a sign of a Biden team that’s gearing up for a potential re-elect campaign an comes after top fundraisers urged Biden’s aides to shift tactics
I’m encouraging them to court more large donors, one of them said over the summer
Part of their argument has been that the president will need donors in 2024 far more than was needed in 2020 during a pandemic and when Democrats were eagerly opening their wallets to oust Donald Trump from the Oval Office Biden’s engagement with donors is important for another reason, top fundraisers have told his aides: Donors question whether he’s capable of running again, leaving them hesitant to continue cutting checks
One major Democratic fundraiser said donors regularly ask of the president, Is he really with it? Donors who talked to NBC News said they’ve noticed a change with how they’re treated, including making a more conscious effort to set up phone calls with supporters, more regular briefings and even photo lines during visits like Obama made in pivotal states during the midterms
The amped-up effort involves both the White House and a Democratic National Committee that functions as the political arm of Biden’s operation The DNC’s been virtually dormant for two years, one member of the committee said
They’re ramping up their game
Different donors have had different expectations
Tim Lim, a Democratic strategist and Biden bundler, was among those who grew frustrated over the White House's attention to donors, bringing his complaint to the Democratic National Committee It’s childish, frankly
I even admit that now, Lim said
There’s no reason to do it
But when you’re trying to get an Easter Egg Roll ticket for your family, you kind of get desperate
The White House’s shift in paying closer attention to supporters was an obvious one, he said, citing invites to a garden tour, the unveiling of Obama’s White House portrait, White House trick-or-treating as well as holiday parties Another donor, who in the past complained of not having enough access, cited a recent Zoom call with White House senior adviser Steve Ricchetti and deputy chief of staff Jen O’Malley Dillon that was directed at some of Biden’s earliest supporters
Some of those same people were invited to the White House next month for an in-person policy briefing Some donors, however, think the White House took too long to step up its game
Getting up to speed has taken longer than it should, said Susie Tompkins Buell, a longtime high-dollar Democratic donor
She said supporters recognized the administration was consumed by excessive workloads and traumas early on I think donors understand but communication absolutely needs more effective attention, Buell added
She said she’s seeing more examples of the White House recognizing it needs to appreciate donors but that it seems like it was not a natural instinct
A running question throughout this administration has been whether Biden, who turned 80 years old last week, will mount one more campaign or step aside
Kessler said he spoke to Biden in late October at a Pennsylvania Democratic Party event and thanked him for having recently affirmed it’s his intention to run agai I know you get tired of hearing, ‘Is he really running?’ Kessler recalled telling the president
But when you come out with strong statements like that, it’s very helpful to people like me who are asked all the time
And how did Biden respond He liked it, Kessler said
President Donald Trump is boxing his own shadow as he seeks the Republican presidential nomination — and that’s not likely to change anytime soon
There’s little incentive for rivals to join him in the ring, according to advisers to potential candidates and other Republican strategists From the front row, Florida Gov
Ron DeSantis is collecting support fro prominent donor an beating Trum in some polls o key state
If he runs, that announcement isn’t expected to come until summer at the earliest — probably after Florida’s legislative session ends in June — which will give him time to gauge his own chances He’s not in a hurry because he doesn’t have to be
And he has a day job: governor, said one top Florida Republican who was in regular contact with DeSantis throughout his 2022 re-election campaign and spoke anonymously to relay how he believes DeSantis is thinking Dan Eberhart, a Republican fundraiser who once backed Trump but now wants DeSantis to be the party’s nominee in 2024, said there's time If Trump is going to be in, I would like for him not to be the only national Republican candidate out there, Eberhart said
But DeSantis isn’t going to get in until after the Florida legislative session ends, at least
Anyone that gets in now runs the risk of peaking too early
The two-part early conclusion drawn by many GOP insiders is that the only way to beat Trump is by unifying around a single alternative and that DeSantis is the best of the rest That’s why the timing calculations are a bit more complicated for the lower-polling candidates, who also have to worry that the race quickly becomes a clash of titans between Trump and DeSantis with little available space for also-rans
The questions of whether and when to jump in are inexorably linked, as windows of opportunity can open and close at a moment’s notice Trump’s early announcement for president — which he almost made before the midterm elections last week — followed nearly two years of planning, fundraising and speeches
His interest in announcing a presidential bid intensified last year when President Joe Biden’s approval ratings dropped amid the souring economy and chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan
Aides say his desire to run became even more earnest as he increasingly saw DeSantis as a threat and, then, as the Department of Justice opened two separate criminal investigations into him over his role in the Jan
6 riot at the US
Capitol and his possession and storage of sensitive documents that the federal government says he improperly handled in his post-presidency But others aren’t feeling Trump’s urgency Since Trump’s Tuesday speech, there have been more signs of movement in the invisible primary — the behind-the-scenes battle to line up donors, endorsers and top staff — than a rush to launch People are either waiting or scrambling to get as close to DeSantis’ inner circle as possible — or they’re with Trump, Eberhart said of the donor class In the world of GOP elites, the field is quickly narrowing to Trump and DeSantis, and the Florida Republican source said there is something unique about their rivalry The fact is Ron is different from any other Republican who might run against Trump, the Republican said
Ron is in Trump’s head.  The other guys aren’t
Ron made a red wave in the state when it didn’t materialize really anywhere else
He won by a historic margin
And billionaires are basically begging him to run
In addition to the celebrity from his big re-election win of nearly 20 points, DeSantis has an edge over some of the other possible non-Trump candidates: money
His political and campaign committees had at least $64 million in the bank, according to the most recent campaign finance data DeSantis continued to fundraise after the election but has no immediately known plans to convert the state political committee into a federal super PAC that could support his federal candidacy Florida also has a so-called resign to run law that would require DeSantis, if he qualifies to run for president, to resign as governor after the 2024 election — whether or not he wins the presidency
Legislative allies are expected to change the law during the spring lawmaking session but they’re waiting on smoke signals from the Plaza Level, said a knowledgeable legislative source referring to the Tallahassee shorthand for the location of the governor’s office on the first floor of the state Capitol One reason for the other hopefuls to wait outside the ring is the hope that Trump and DeSantis bloody each other badly enough to turn the title fight into a battle royal
Former Vice President Mike Pence, who needs no introduction to voters, is on a book tour
In fact, his book came out on the same day as Trump’s big announcement
He didn’t watch Trump’s launch speech Tuesday, according to an aide, and has said he could wait until the spring to announce whether he will run Like DeSantis, Virginia Gov
Glenn Youngkin is expected to keep his focus on state matters, possibly until Virginia’s legislative session ends in February
But Youngkin maintained a robust schedule on behalf of Republican candidates in the midterms, earning chits in key states, and he has a growing list of prominent GOP donors ready to back him should he join the race
Trump appears to have noticed, targeting the governor with a racist, somewhat confusing, attac on his social media platform.  South Dakota Gov
Kristi Noem, long viewed as having eyes on the presidency, made critical remarks of Trump on Wednesday in The New York Time
But in a War Room podcas interview on Thursday with former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, she walked back the remarks and issued a mild criticism of DeSantis for briefly locking down Florida during spring break when the Covid pandemic first hit in 2020 The better known a potential candidate is, the longer he or she can afford to wait
It takes more time and money for more obscure hopefuls to become familiar to voters
The GOP primary electorate is familiar with Trump and Pence from their time in the White House, and, to a lesser extent, DeSantis and even Youngkin a bit from their recent high-profile gubernatorial wins The Pence aide says there’s no concern in his camp that anti-Trump donors will all flock to DeSantis I think that the donor base is so large that that is not a threat; I don’t think there could be that level of consolidation, the Pence aide said, pointing to loyalty among the former vice president’s contributors that transcends pure political calculation
There are elements of the donor base that I think he appeals to because of his faith and his devotion in that faith that other candidates don’t really appeal to
But would-be candidates who haven’t been in the political arena as recently — former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, former U. N
Ambassador Nikki Haley and former New Jersey Gov
Chris Christie among them — may have to make their decisions a little more quickly
Few are tipping their hands now The secretary hasn’t made a final decision about whether or not he will run, a person close to Pompeo said
But that decision will be based on if he thinks it is the best place for him to serve and if the timing is correct
Christie is clearly eager to hammer Trum , but it’s not clear whether that will be as a candidate or perhaps as a commentator on television
He is open to a run, said longtime adviser Mike DuHaime, who added that Christie will not jump in unless he sees a path to the nomination
Either way, DuHaime said, Trump’s entry has no effect on Christie’s thinking and no decision is imminent Trump’s team has long held the position that he’s expecting other Republicans to run against him and that, if a critical number of primary challengers line up, it would make his candidacy even more formidable We have at least 30% of the Republican primary electorate that will do anything to support the [former] president
And the value of their votes becomes proportionately higher if a bunch of others pile in the race and dilute the not-Trump vote and divide it up between them, said one Trump strategist who spoke anonymously to share the campaign’s thinking In the days since Trump’s launch, his campaign has released a string of endorsements from lawmakers
But the number is much lower than the set that he endorsed in the recent midterm elections, and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif, dodged this week when he was asked whether he backs Trump for president Steven Cheung, the communications director for Trump’s campaign, said that the former president believes America is in decline due to the weak leadership of Joe Biden, adding that there are others who will be bound to the political establishment, be beholden to corporations and drag the United States into more unnecessary wars
Brad Todd, a veteran Republican strategist, said it makes more sense for hopefuls to take their time for a variety of logistical reasons, including federal fundraising limits that are imposed once a candidacy becomes official
But more than that, he said, Republican voters are exhausted Campaigns have gotten bigger and rougher and louder, and I think voters reach a capacity when they need a break, Todd said
My advice for anyone running for anything in 2024 right now would be let the voters have their holiday
One GOP strategist who worked for Trump in the past said that DeSantis would be smart to stay out and let the former president see how much his own support has dissipated even without a big rival in the race If he’s not in, it will just drive Trump crazy, the strategist said
You’re going to have all these donors, all these folks waiting for DeSantis and that’s going to be their answer [when Trump asks for help]
And that’s just going to twist the knife.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s departure from leadership could easily have led to a power vacuum in which a host of ambitious lawmakers — old and young — publicly battled it out for the chance to lead House Democrats
Instead, a new generation — Reps
Hakeem Jeffries, 52, of New York; Katherine Clark, 59, of Massachusetts; and Pete Aguilar, 43, of California — will almost certainly be elected to the top three leadership slots this week without a challenge or much fanfare There were a couple of bumps along the way
Some younger members are bitte that 82-year-old Majority Whip Jim Clyburn of South Carolina has opted to remain in leadership rather than follow Pelosi, also 82, and Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, 83, into the sunset But, by and large, Pelosi and her almost-certain successor, Jeffries, have been able to orchestrate a smooth passing of the torch from one generation to the next Shortly before Pelosi’s announcement Thursday that she was stepping down, Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff signaled he would not run for House leadership and would focus his efforts on a future Senate bid instead
That avoided a knock-down, drag-out fight between Schiff, a top Pelosi ally, fellow Californian and prolific fundraiser, and Jeffries, who is poised to become the first Black leader of a congressional caucus Hoyer, of Maryland, who has served in leadership since George H. W
Bush was president, also said he would not seek the top job and instead plans to return to the powerful Appropriations Committee And rather than taking on Clark for the No
2 leadership post, Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal of Washington decided to run for another ter leading her caucus of roughly 100 House liberals However, Clyburn’s decision to remain in leadership represented a setback for those calling for new blood and hoping for a clean break from the triumvirate of Pelosi, Hoyer and Clyburn that had ruled the Democrats for the past two decades Clyburn announced he would run for his old post in the minority, known as assistant leader, which deprived younger members from occupying that role
It had been considered the No
3 job Aguilar originally had his eyes set on the assistant leader position, but Clyburn’s move forced him to run for caucus chair
Under a new arrangement, assistant leader will shift to No
4 and Democratic Caucus chair will move up to No.  3 That left Rep
Joe Neguse, 38, who had been campaigning behind the scenes for months for caucus chair, as the odd man out Some Neguse allies urged him to stay in the race and take on Aguilar, frustrated by the domino effect created by Clyburn’s decision
But Pelosi quickly endorsed the slate of young leaders — Jeffries, Clark and Aguilar — and others followed suit, heading off any possibility of a rebellion from the rank and file and a messy leadership fight between Aguilar and Neguse There are a lot of upset folks
The feeling is that Speaker Pelosi and Leader Hoyer had the grace to step aside, and people cannot believe that Clyburn is unwilling to do it
There is really resentment there about the down-ballot impact, one younger House Democrat told NBC News There’s incredulity at the idea that this is simply about holding onto power — not that there’s a particular goal in sight
It’s hard to feel like we are turning the page
A Clyburn spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment
Clyburn has called Jeffries, Clark and Aguilar our new generation of Democratic Leaders but has not weighed in on the Neguse situation Last week, a potential escape hatch emerged
Neguse informed colleagues on Nov
21 he was officially dropping his bid for caucus chair and would run to be chair of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee (DPCC), the House Democrats’ messaging arm, if the DPCC operation could be restructured
Soon after, Jeffries, Clark and Aguilar informed their members in a joint letter that a rule change would be offered this week to do precisely that: overhaul the DPCC to have one elected chairman, likely Neguse, and three elected co-chairs underneath Some members have referred to that post as the chair of chairs and it's a structure that has existed before Neguse almost certainly would be the favorite to win that race
The son of Eritrean immigrants and the first Black congressman elected from Colorado, Neguse saw his national profile rise after serving as a Democratic prosecutor during former President Donald Trump’s second impeachment trial
For the past two years, he has served as one of four co-chairs of the DPCC, alongside Reps
Matt Cartwright of Pennsylvania, Debbie Dingell of Michigan and Ted Lieu of California; Dingell and Lieu are now among at least four candidates running for vice chair of the Democratic Caucus Over the past two years, I worked alongside my fellow DPCC Co-Chairs to engage each member of our diverse caucus to develop our message framing, Neguse said in a letter to colleagues Monday
That message of putting People Over Politics became an essential tool for our members as we defended our democracy and defied historic norms by limiting Republican gains in this year’s election
In addition to Dingell and Lieu, Reps
Madeleine Dean of Pennsylvania and Congressional Black Caucus Chair Joyce Beatty of Ohio are running for vice chair of the caucus.  It's the No
5 slot, seen as a steppingstone to other top leadership roles The race to lead the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the House Democrats' campaign arm, for the 2024 cycle will feature a matchup between two Californians, Reps
Tony Cardenas and Ami Bera
Georgia's election law that took effect last yea means at least one major change for voters in the Senate runoff rac between Democratic incumbent Raphael Warnock and Republican Herschel Walker: They'll be heading back to the polls a lot sooner The law, Senate Bill 20 , signed by Republican Gov
Brian Kemp in March 2021, cut in half the tim allowed between a general election and a runoff election — drastically shortening the period during which many voters must request, receive and cast ballots
The law's narrowed time frame also effectively cuts the early in-person voting period, from a minimum of 16 days in 2020 to a minimum of 5 in 2022, while existing rules have ensured almost no new voters will be eligible to vote in the runoff Proponents of the bill's provisions on runoffs argue that cutting the period eases a long and arduous process for everyone involved
The law's authors even wrote into the bill that the lengthy nine-week runoffs in 2020 were exhausting for candidates, donors, and 120 electors
Other supporters, including Gabriel Sterling, the chief operating officer in the Office of the Georgia Secretary of State, note that before 2013, the state's runoff period was four weeks and that the elections ran without problems This is not the first time we've had to do this, Sterling said at a news conferenc last week
This is not that unique
But voting rights advocates, both in Georgia and around the country, say the new law's changes present challenges
It was not just that the runoff date was moved up, it’s that the period to get so many steps done has been condensed, said Danielle Lang, the senior director of the voting rights unit at the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan voting watchdog group The big takeaway here is that the compressing of the time line for a runoff has spillover effects on access for voters, she said Here are several of the ways the new law could affect voters in the runoff Under SB 202, Georgia runoff elections now take place 28 days after the general election — less than half the original nine-week period that existed before the law
This year’s runoff will take place on Dec.  6, following the Nov.  8 midterms
The law, however, does not change an existing rule that voters must register at least 30 days before an election As a result, new voters who weren’t registered for the general election will not be able to register in time to vote in the runoff  because the deadline will have already passed That’s a stark difference from the landscape in the state in 2020 — that year both of the state’s US
Senate races advanced to a runoff that would determine control of the chamber — when candidates and outside groups rushed to register droves of new voters The bottom line is that nobody can vote in this runoff who didn’t register as of Nov.  7, said Lang
She added there’s likely still a narrow new pool of voters who registered too late to vote in the general election but could make the 30-day deadline for the runoff Domestic, absentee mail-in ballot voters will now have a much shorter window in which to do everything required of them to cast their ballots on time Before SB 202, these voters would have had nine weeks to request an absentee ballot, receive that ballot and mail it in or drop it off
Now they will have to do all that in half the time Under existing runoff procedures, most Georgians who want to cast an absentee mail-in ballot (voters 65 and older and disabled voters will be sent an absentee mail-in ballot automatically if registered to vote) must first request such a ballot, in compliance with the law's new voter ID requirement
The deadline for local election officials to receive those absentee ballot applications is Nov
25, the day after Thanksgiving
If most voters don’t mail their applications well before the Nov
25 deadline, local election officials could be dealing with a backlog upon returning from the Thanksgiving weekend on Monday Nov
28 — the same day early in-person voting will begin in most counties
The law mandates that the ballots must be mailed to voters within three days of receipt of the applications — a tight time frame that advocates warn may not be met, given that the deadline overlaps with a holiday and comes just days before the start of early in-person voting Once voters receive their absentee ballots, they must choose their candidates and mail those ballots back, again in compliance with the voter ID requirement
Absentee mail-in ballots received before 7 p. m
on the day of the election — Dec
6 — will be counted, per Georgia’s law
Voters may also deposit their absentee ballots in drop boxes Voting rights activists, who have worked to bolster awareness of the new rules through voter education initiatives, expressed concern that the deadlines would sneak up on voters, especially with the holiday The shorter time frame may be a challenge to voters who don't realize how quickly some of these deadline are going to come up or who haven't thought through how they are going to vote, said Andrew Garber, an attorney at the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law
Under a separate provision of SB 202, overseas and military absentee voters were provided a ranked choice voting ballot as their general election ballot weeks before the general election so that, in the event of a runoff, their vote would have already been mailed in
This keeps SB 202 in compliance with a federal law requiring that overseas and military absentee voters be mailed their ballots 45 days before a federal election Because of the condensed time frame between the general election and the runoff, many Georgia voters will also be looking at a shortened, five-day, weekday-only period of early in-person voting Plus, due to an ongoing lawsuit against the state, it remains uncertain whether one Saturday early voting day, on Nov
26, will be allowed SB 202 stipulates that early in-person voting must end the Friday before the runoff
This year, that would be Friday Dec.  2
The law, as interpreted by the Georgia secretary of state’s office also stipulates that early in-person voting not be held on any Saturday that follows a public or legal holiday on the preceding Thursday or Friday
This year, that would mean there would be no early in-person voting on Nov
26, the Saturday following Thanksgiving
But a Fulton County judge ruled Friday that the offic cannot prohibit counties from allowing voting that day, after a voting rights group, along with Warnoc and his campaign, sue the state, claiming  the specific language of the law suggested that the barring of Saturday voting after a holiday — in this case Thanksgiving — doesn’t actually apply to runoff elections Georgia’s attorney general plans to appeal, a spokesperson for the office told NBC News
As a result, whether counties can offer voting that day remains in limbo If voting is ultimately not allowed on that Saturday, SB 202 says Saturday voting should be held the previous weekend (in this year’s case, Saturday, Nov.  19)
But under Georgia law, runoff voting may not begin until after officials have certified the general election vote, which will be on Monday, Nov
21, per the Georgia Secretary of State’s office
That means, no Saturday voting will be allowed on Nov.  19, either
Whether the judiciary allows voting on Nov
26 or not, the only other days most voters will  be able to vote early in-person will be from Monday Nov.  28 to Friday Dec.  2
The law states that early voting shall end on the Friday immediately prior to each primary, election, or runoff
That five-day period, however, represents the minimum required under the law, and county election officials have the discretion to schedule additional early-in person voting days that comply with the law's other rules, Lang and Garber and others said Voting rights groups have pushed Georgia counties, for example, to open early-in person voting on Nov
22, 23 and 27 (the Tuesday and Wednesday before Thanksgiving and the Sunday after)
As of Friday, at least nine of the state's 159 countie had opened up Nov
2 for early voting, and a smaller handful opened it up for Nov
22 and 23 During the 2020 runoff election, many voters had a period of several weeks to vote early in person — and all had the possibility to do so on at least on one Saturday Voting rights experts warn that SB 202’s restrictions on drop boxes will also affect the ease with which many absentee voters can drop off their ballots The law says such drop boxes can be located only inside election offices, and early voting locations and are available only during the office or polling site's hours of operation This year, these drop boxes will be available only during early in-person voting
In the counties that adhere to the minimum requirement — Monday to Friday the week before the election — those same limitations will also affect drop-box access
How the judiciary rules on the Nov
26 issue would also be a factor here In 2020, if you had had an absentee ballot and were worried whether it would arrive at an election office on time, you could go drop of it off on a Saturday, said Rahul Garabadu, a senior voting rights attorney at the Georgia American Civil Liberties Union
But now because of SB 202, you can only do that during the hours of early voting, which can often be a regular 9-to-5
As a result, he suggested, more people may choose to mail in their ballot instead — a fact that then brings into play any potential postal delays All of these provisions interact with each other, Garabadu said
When they combine, you see a cumulative effect on voters, which makes it tougher to cast their ballots.
The politics of anti-regime protest are dominating the run-up to a World Cup showdown between the US
and Ira , with coaches and players fielding politically charged questions before Tuesday’s match Given the long-running hostility between Washington and Tehra , any sporting contest between the two countries carries political overtones
But the recent wave of street protests in Iran has injected a particularly heavy dose of politics, especially after the US
Soccer Federation tweeted an altered Iranian flag, one without the emblem of the Islamic Republic, to show solidarit with Iranian women demonstrating against the government Follow along for live coverage of Tuesday's World Cu Iran responded by demanding that the US
be expelled from the quadrennial tournament, arguing that the social media posts, which also showed up on Facebook and Instagram, violated the rules and regulations of FIFA, the sport’s governing body The US
federation later said that the posts were intentional but that they would now display the Iranian flag in full
The State Department said it had not coordinated in any way with the soccer federation, and the US
team said it was not informed of the symbolic gesture beforehand Beyond the political firestorm, the game itself comes with high stakes, as the young US
team needs a win to advance to the next stage of the tournament
But at a news conference on the eve of the match, coach Gregg Berhalter and team captain Tyler Adams faced one political question after another from Iranian journalists Asked about his views on US
restrictions on visas for Iranian citizens, Berhalter said: I don’t know enough about politics.  I’m a soccer coach
He also was asked for his thoughts about the US
military’s presence in the Persian Gulf
Meanwhile, an Iranian reporter lectured Adams about his pronunciation of the country’s name, saying it was not I-RAN but EE-RON
First of all, you say you support the Iranian people, but you’re pronouncing our country’s name wrong, the reporter said
Then he asked Adams about how he felt about playing for a country that has so much discrimination against Black people in its own borders
Adams, whose biological father is African American, apologized for his pronunciation of Iran and answered the question about race relations
You know, one thing that I’ve learned, especially from living abroad in the past years and having to fit in in different cultures and kind of assimilate into different cultures, is that in the US, we’re continuing to make progress every single day, said Adams, who plays for Leeds United in England’s Premier League
He added: I think as long as you see progress, that’s the most important thing
When Iran’s coach, Carlos Queiroz, spoke to reporters, he also tried to steer the discussion away from politics I understand your questions and the stories that you, as professionals, you need to bring, Queiroz said
But he added: Let’s enjoy that party.  Let’s enjoy the show
The street protests in Iran began in September, when a 22-year-old woman from the country’s Kurdish region died in the hospital three days after she was arrested and accused of violating the country’s strict dress code
The protests at home have followed Iran’s soccer team throughout the World Cup, which began Nov.  20 in Qatar
At some of the games, Qatari police have confiscated T-shirts or signs supporting the protests in Iran Team captain Ehsan Hajsafi expressed empathy for protesting Iranians at a news conference We have to accept that the situation in our country is not good and that our people are not happy, they are discontent, Hajsafi said
We are here, but it does not mean we should not be their voice or that we should not respect them
Whatever we have is theirs
Last week, Iran’s players refused to sing the country’s national anthe before their opening match against England in an apparent act of defiance against their government More recently, a prominent former soccer player in Iran, Voria Ghafouri, was arrested after he endorsed the protests, according to Iranian state-linked media
He was later released on bail, Iranian and other media reported Apart from politics, Jürgen Klinsmann, the former German soccer star who was the US
men’s coach in the 2014 World Cup, infuriated Iran with a comment last week about its soccer culture, suggesting Iranian players use tricks to sway referees This is just part of their culture.  That’s how they play.  They work the referee
You saw the bench always jumping up, always working the linesman, constantly in their ears
They’re constantly in your face, Klinsmann, a BBC commentator, sai after Iran defeated Wales 2-0 on Friday The US
men’s team last faced Iran in a World Cup in 1998, and the Americans lost 2-1 in a bitter defeat that saw jubilant Iranian fans pour into the streets — in stark contrast to the mood in Iran ahead of the current match, which has been dampened by the protests and the regime’s violent crackdown
Iranians have burned posters promoting the national team even as its members have signaled support for the protesters, and there were no big crowds after Iran’s victory over Wales in their last match
Berhalter played for the US
team in the last game, which was also upstaged by political tensions between the two countries
The coach at the time, Steve Sampson, said last week it was difficult to concentrate on the game at hand because of the politics swirling around it
It was a challenge to keep the players focused, Sampson sai In a departure from protocol, the two teams posed for a photo together before the game, and the Iranian side handed over white roses in a gesture of peace
But in retrospect, Sampson said, he wished he had not agreed to the photo session I’ve reflected on this for years, Sampson said
If I had to do it all over again, I would not have allowed the exchange of roses or the joint picture.
