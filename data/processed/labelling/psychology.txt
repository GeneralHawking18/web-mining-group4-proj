Catalin Micu, 54, killed mum-of-one Ramona Stoia, 35, in a suspected murder-suicide on April 11 in at their tattoo studio called GothInk Studio in Canterbury, Kent A tattoo artist stabbed his wife to death in an unprovoked attack before turning the knife on himself in the studio where they worked, an inquest heard today
Catalin Micu, 54, killed mum-of-one Ramona Stoia, 35, in a suspected murder-suicide on April 11 in Canterbury, Kent
Not long after their deaths it came out that Micu was facing allegations he raped Ramona multiple times throughout their marriage
The couple has a young child together
Micu was on police bail when he was found dead at their GothInk Studio with Ramona
Micu died from a stab wound to the stomach, an inquest into his death at County Hall in Maidstone, Kent heard
An earlier hearing this week heard Ramona suffered a knife wound to her neck
Coroner Katrina Hepburn said Micu killed his wife before he was seen going behind a curtain before his death
Before the apparent murder-suicide, Micu was interviewed by police after his wife accused him of multiple sexual assaults against her
Kent Police then referred itself to police watchdog the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) following its contact with the couple before their deaths
The IPOC has since confirmed it will not be investigating and the force will be left to carry out its own probe into the handling of the case
The watchdog added that it will scrutinise the results of the internal investigation
On April 11, dozens of armed police swooped in at the studio at about 5
20pm, where they found the couple dead
Detectives are not looking for anyone else in connection to their deaths
Ramona's is being treated as suspicious and Micu's is not, police said
Ramona's death led to an outpouring of tributes, where she was a well-known tattoo artist in the community
A collage of pictures of Ramona has since been put up on the doors of the shop, along with dozens of flowers, candles and written tributes
One heartfelt poem, called Shining Star, reads: A shining star snatched from our sky
The question we ask ourselves is why? A wonderful spirit loved by all
An amazing lady so beautiful
Taken by the angels in such a cruel way
So heartbroken can't find the words to say
The tattoos you created are your legacy
Up in heaven now spirit flying free
A tribute left at the scene reads: RIP Ramona
You were a beautiful soul
You will be missed so much
Another says: I never knew you but unfortunately can relate to your experiences
You deserved to be here and free of violence
I hope you have some sense of peace
In February, Ramona secured a non-molestation order - a court injunction restricting or banning contact - against Micu
The tattoo artists married in Las Vegas four years ago but are understood to have recently separated
It is thought the couple - who have a young son - continued to live together, but Micu was banned from harassing or pestering her
On March 26, Micu was arrested on suspicion of having breached this order, and of seriously sexually assaulting his wife
Ramona came forward with a series of historic allegations of rape against her husband, dating back throughout their 16-year relationship but primarily taking place in the last few years
There were five separate allegations, all of which reportedly took place at the family home
Following his arrest, Micu was placed on police bail until April 20
Anyone who has any concerns or information regarding the incident is asked to contact the police via the Kent Police website or by calling 101, quoting 11-0995, or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111

French financier Charles-Henry Kurzen jumped to his death from a luxury apartment he was viewing in a high rise New York block while he was being shown around by a real estate agent A French financier jumped from a luxury New York apartment in a high rise block after asking where the balcony was while he was being shown around by an estate agent
The 43-year-old man, identified as Charles-Henry Kurzen, fell from the 32nd-floor balcony at 100 United Nations Plaza which is in the Turtle Bay neighbourhood of Manhatten
He threw himself off the building at 1
15pm local time and landed on a third-floor patio, a police spokesman said
The financial banker, who was living in Brooklyn, had been taking a look at the apartment with a real estate agent when he then suddenly jumped, according to a source
Mr Kurzen was pronounced dead at the scene
A coworker didn't comment except to say that Mr Kurzen was a dear friend, reported the New York Post
He was a financier who graduated from the Ecole Superieure de Commerce de Paris (ESCP) Business School and was a partner at Saltbox Partners LLC
The company’s biography of him on its website showed that he had a long career working in French and US finance
Other roles that he has had includes an analyst in the the Mergers and Acquisitions Group at Lazard Freres & Co.  in Paris
Saltbox Partners website stated: Charles-Henry has been with Saltbox since the beginning
He has over 14 years of experience in the banking sector and has worked with Nina since moving to New York to start his project finance career at Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank where he was involved in the origination, structuring and execution of 15 financings of over $5 billion
See what’s happening near you by entering your postcode below or visit InYourArea Previously Charles-Henry was an analyst in the Mergers and Acquisitions Group at Lazard Freres & Co.  in Paris
Charles-Henry is a true practitioner who enjoys all the intricacies of non-recourse financings, and the challenges of bringing new deal profiles and sponsors to market
His experience has spanned financing coal mining development to the introduction of renewable power in South Africa
In conjunction with Saltbox’s work on Phase 1 of this landmark program, Charles-Henry wrote an article about this long awaited initiative by the South African government
He is a graduate of Ecole Superieure de Commerce de Paris (ESCP) Business School
The block of flat is close to the United Nations building in New York and a two-bedroom, two-and-a-half bathroom apartment on the 32nd floor is advertised for sale for $2. 9 million (£2. 29 million)

Jade Roberts, 26, took her own life just hours after taking a video laughing and playing with her kids in the garden and was described as a woman with a 'heart of gold' A young mum was found dead just hours after laughing with her children in the garden as she faced a hidden battle behind her brave facade
Jade Roberts, 26, from Liverpool, has been described as a woman who would do anything for anyone and had a heart of gold, but was suffering with anxiety and depression underneath her smiles
Now, her heartbroken mum Tracey says she is dedicated to ending the stigma over the silent killer, and said she had two choices when her beautiful daughter died suddenly and just hours after she was captured on video laughing with her children
Tracey described her daughter as an unbelievable mum as every minute of the day was dedicated to her children, but she never realised the true extent of what her daughter was going through behind the scenes
As Tracey herself spiralled deeper into a depression after Jade took her own life in April last year, she told the ECHO she could either spiral further and give up or make a positive change and help others
With the help of her loved ones, the trained psychotherapist began the process of setting up a project in her daughter's name
The Jade Roberts Project will soon be opening its building at Merseyside's 109 Rocky Lane which will help them provide workshops on anxiety, depression, suicide prevention and coping techniques as well as providing a counselling service
Those in suicidal crisis can access the project through a referral
After losing Jade to suicide last year, I've never experienced depression like it, said Tracey
I was stuck in my bedroom, crying all the time, no motivation
I was suffering PTSD, I wasn't sleeping
My daughter had to basically look after me
I have a lot of resilience and I had two choices
I could either go further and give up, but I went with the other choice, to help
I don't want anyone to go through the pain that myself and my family have gone through
The pain will never go away, I'm just learning to live with it
With the hope of ending the stigma and spreading the message that it's okay to not be okay, the family say it feels like Jade is still here as they create a legacy in her memory and for her children
Tracey added: After that I lived in the library, I did a lot of research
There's no help out there for people
I thought I have to change this
I truly believe everything I've learnt about the signs, all the knowledge I now have, Jade would still be here
A fundraising page was set up last year to kickstart the charity with the money going towards the renting of the building so people can attend when they are referred, as well as allowing the volunteers to get the relevant training
But more needs to be raised to ensure the help can continue, and more training can be undertaken to help save lives
The fundraiser, which will go towards training such as ASIST (Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training), can be found here
More information about ASIST can be found by clicking here
If you are affected by this story there are many people who would be happy to talk to you: Samaritans If you need to talk and don't know where to turn to, the Samaritans operate a free helpline open 24/7 on 116 123

Visit their website for details on helplines, how to access crisis services and what to do if you're unable to get help yourself
*In an emergency, dial 999 for urgent help Tracey added: The more people trained in ASIST the more lives can be saved, but it's over £100 per person
There's a five-day course in October that's £3,000 each but I truly believe with these skills, we can reach out to more
With the hopes of an open day on October 1 and the official launch of the project on October 3, Tracey is reaching out for more volunteers who are willing to help as well as support workers and counsellors
Those that are can email enquiries@thejaderobertsproject. co. uk
As well as a 10-week project focusing on mental health and a counselling service, Tracey has high hopes for the future in the form of a befriending service, yoga classes, walks in the park and hiring a minibus for days out
A billboard outside of their building will also spread the message that it's okay to not be okay
She said: Suicide is a silent killer, you can't see what's going on in someone's head
You can see a black eye or a broken leg and breaking that stigma, to me, is about more people coming forward and talking about how they are really feeling
It's about making people feel listened to and giving them hope
See what’s happening near you by entering your postcode below or visit InYourArea After Jade's death, tributes came pouring in for her, with the devoted mum described as a caring and compassionate woman
Having this charity in her name is an honour, her family said, with Tracey adding: It isn't just a random project, it's emotional because of what it stands for
But it's in honour of my beautiful daughter to help people and save lives and while I'm doing this, it's like she's still here, her name is being mentioned all the time
In the hope of spreading awareness and raising further funds towards the project, Jade's siblings Danni and Jake will be bravely taking to the skies on September 24 at 2pm for a skydive
Having already raised over £1,000, the fundraiser can be found by clicking here

There was no note or any evidence to suggest army gunner Sophie Madden, 23, had planned to take her own life but coroner Katrina Hepburn returned a verdict of suicide There was no indication that a mum who was found hanged in an army shower block had planned to take her own life, an inquest has heard
Army gunner Sophie Madden, 23, originally from Wigan in Lancashire, was found dead in the shower block of the Saint Martin's Plain Army Training Centre in Folkestone, Kent
The mum-of-one had been on a night out with friends and colleagues the evening before her death, visiting a number of Folkestone pubs and playing pool in the barracks’ bar before heading to bed at around 1am on June 10
Sophie, a gunner in the British Army’s third Regiment Royal Horse Artillery, was seen heading towards the shower block shortly after, but this was considered normal as she often showered before bed
The next morning at around 9
30am a colleague went to the shower block and saw Ms Madden's belongings on a bench outside her preferred cubicle
She looked under the door and saw Ms Madden's legs, which raised the alarm, and once the cubicle door was opened it was found Ms Madden had hanged herself, the inquest in Maidstone heard on Monday
A report by Detective Sergeant Andrew West of Kent Police of the police investigation into Sophie’s death found no signs of third party involvement or criminal activity
The inquest heard there is no evidence she was expecting anyone to come in to the shower block and did not tell anyone she was feeling in any way suicidal, or made anyone aware of any issues when she went in
A toxicology report found she had 173mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood in her system, more than double the drink-drive limit, but friends who went out with her the night before said she had drunk less than she usually would
Ms Madden had no ongoing physical health issues, according to her GP, and she was not known to local mental health services
She had been placed on a vulnerability register by the Army in 2020 after she was seen hitting her head against a wall after drinking alcohol, but after two years of observation and weekly check-ups she was removed from the list in 2022
Colleagues said there were rumours Ms Madden had self-harmed and had a difficult upbringing, and in 2020 she was the victim of an alleged assault by the father of her son Jayden - however she declined to support a prosecution

One of Ms Madden's four sisters, Chantelle, spoke to her just hours before she took her own life and in her police statement said the news of Sophie's death was a total surprise and that Ms Madden was so well loved
She said Ms Madden had claimed she was stressed that her phone was broken and she did not have the money to fix it, and also that she was facing a bill for damages caused by her pet dog at her previous Army accommodation
In a statement, her sister said: Sophie was a strong, independent woman, and didn't tend to worry about things
I told her I'd send her some money and a spare phone the next day, but I didn't have any concerns for her safety or mental health
There was no note or any evidence to suggest premeditation, but coroner Katrina Hepburn returned a verdict of suicide at the inquest held in County Hall, Maidstone on Monday
The coroner explained: I'm satisfied it was Sophie who did the act . .
and there is no evidence of anyone else being involved
I have to consider whether Sophie intended to take her own life or if it was a cry for help
There is no evidence she was expecting anyone to come in and didn't tell anyone she was feeling in any way suicidal, or made anyone aware of any issues when she went in
I am satisfied she did in fact intend to take her own life, and satisfied all other scenarios have been ruled out
Therefore a conclusion of suicide is needed on the balance of probability

Get email updates with the day's biggest stories There was no note or any evidence to suggest army gunner Sophie Madden, 23, had planned to take her own life but coroner Katrina Hepburn returned a verdict of suicide There was no indication that a mum who was found hanged in an army shower block had planned to take her own life, an inquest has heard
Army gunner Sophie Madden, 23, originally from Wigan in Lancashire, was found dead in the shower block of the Saint Martin's Plain Army Training Centre in Folkestone, Kent
The mum-of-one had been on a night out with friends and colleagues the evening before her death, visiting a number of Folkestone pubs and playing pool in the barracks’ bar before heading to bed at around 1am on June 10
Sophie, a gunner in the British Army’s third Regiment Royal Horse Artillery, was seen heading towards the shower block shortly after, but this was considered normal as she often showered before bed
The next morning at around 9
30am a colleague went to the shower block and saw Ms Madden's belongings on a bench outside her preferred cubicle
She looked under the door and saw Ms Madden's legs, which raised the alarm, and once the cubicle door was opened it was found Ms Madden had hanged herself, the inquest in Maidstone heard on Monday

New research by Deaths by Welfare concludes the Department for Work and Pensions failed to fix systematic flaws in the disability benefits system that potentially led to thousands of deaths You can listen to an audio version of this article here The Government’s failure to act on warnings about its disability benefits systems has been linked to hundreds – maybe even ­thousands – of suicides and other deaths of disabled people
A detailed 160-page study published today exposes how the Department for Work and Pensions was alerted more than 40 times to life-threatening systemic flaws, by academics, coroners and its own researchers over the past 30 years
The Mirror has been given exclusive access to the Deaths by Welfare Timeline, which brings together for the first time the three decades of ­investigations linking DWP and its social security reforms with the deaths of disabled benefit claimants
It documents the DWP’s cumulative harm and slow bureaucratic violence that has led to countless suicides and other deaths, particularly in the post-2010 austerity era
One piece of research connects just one area of the 2010 coalition government’s welfare reforms with an extra 590 suicides between 2010 and 2013
By Rachel Charlton-Dailey, guest editor and founder of The Unwritten Disabled Britain: Doing It For Ourselves, is a week-long series across the Daily Mirror's print and digital platforms, showcasing the lives of disabled people and the issues important to us
The articles have been conceived by disabled people, written by disabled people, and photographs - where possible - taken by disabled people
Throughout this week, we aim to change your mind about how you view disabled people
After all, there are 14 million of us, and we aren’t all the same, it’s time the public stopped listening to lazy stereotypes and viewed disabled people in all our wide-ranging splendor
To read more on The Mirror's week-long series click here Disabled activist Ellen Clifford, author of The War on Disabled People, who provided key input into the Timeline, said it was an enormously important piece of work
She said: Welfare reform has destroyed lives and caused avoidable harm on such a scale that the United Nations made a [2016] finding of grave and systematic violations of ­disabled people’s rights
At the most extreme end this has meant the loss of life
We will probably never know the true number
The culture of dehumanisation and hostility fostered within the DWP to justify the government’s conscious cruelty has meant a complete lack of ­accountability or remorse
The Timeline ­represents an important step in the continuing battle for justice for the victims of welfare reform
Work and pensions ministers have repeatedly been warned of the harm caused by the assessment system, mostly to claimants of out-of-work disability ­benefits such as ­incapacity benefit and employment and support allowance but also the personal independence payment, which was introduced in 2013
As far back as 1995, Professor Nick Wikeley, who would later become an Upper Tribunal judge, was warning new social security legislation would leave marginal groups with ­inadequate protection against the risk of long-term illness
In 2006, Professor Alison Ravetz warned that if the then Labour government was wrong about its proposed incapacity benefit reforms the cost, in stress, to those people and their families will be ­incalculable
Those reforms were rolled out, first under Labour and then – with even harsher restrictions – under Tory-led governments
In March 2010 came the first indication from a coroner the reforms – the work ­capability ­assessment (WCA) and the ­employment and support allowance (ESA) – were having the impact of which Ravetz had warned
Stephen Carré, 41, had taken his life two months earlier after his appeal against being found fit for work was rejected
Coroner Tom Osborne said this trigger led to his suicide, and urged changes to the WCA
In April 2012, Colin Traynor, 29, died following a seizure, after months of growing anxiety about his finances and being wrongly found fit for work
Five months later, Labour’s Michael Meacher became one of the first MPs to speak in parliament about the controversial medical assessments
Sadly, Colin was not an isolated case, he said at the time
Dad Michael O’Sullivan, 60, of North London, took his life in September 2013, again after being found fit for work and ineligible for ESA
He had been claiming incapacity benefit since 2000, due to depression, social anxiety and agoraphobia
To read more content from our week-long series on Disabled Britain click here
In January 2014, coroner Mary Hassell linked his death to the WCA, warning of a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken.  The needless deaths continued. .
Jodey Whiting, 42, took her life in February 2017, after being told by the DWP she had been found fit for work
DWP’s assessors had noted the severity of her mental health ­condition, and the risk posed if she was found fit for work
Two years after her death, the DWP’s Independent Case Examiner found the department had failed five times to follow its safeguarding rules
Errol Graham’s body was discovered by bailiffs who had been sent to evict him in June 2018
He had starved to death, months after DWP wrongly stopped his ESA, and weighed 4st 7lb
In January 2020, Jodey and Errol, 57, were mentioned in the House of Commons with a demand by Labour’s Debbie Abrahams for an independent inquiry
Errol’s daughter-in-law Alison Burton said: It makes us angry and frustrated
You can’t put into words the devastation that department has caused
It just doesn’t seem to care
Debbie Abrahams, a former Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, said: I don’t want any more families like Jodey Whiting’s, Errol Graham’s and hundreds, possibly thousands, more to go through the pain that they have
I have been calling for a public inquiry into the scale and causes of the deaths of social security claimants from 2008 to date
Despite all of this, the ­Government has refused to listen
Claimants continue to lose their lives because of DWP failings
A ­disabled woman, who her family claims was traumatised by the daily demands of the universal credit system, took her life two months ago

Forklift driver Barry Douglas, 44, and friend Claire Vickers, 46, appeared on ITV's This Morning in wheelchairs to talk about the accident which left them with life-changing injuries A man left in a wheelchair after a drunken waterpark accident took his own life just six months later, an inquest heard
Forklift driver Barry Douglas, 44, broke both his legs after sneaking into the lido with a friend at 2am and crashing into the barrier of a closed flume tube
The life-changing injuries left Barry, from Dundee, unable to work as he could not drive, forcing him to move house
The hearing in Winchester, heard that Barry, had moved to Aldershot with his stepfather at the age of 20 and had set up a stable life for himself
Despite some signs his condition was improving, Scottish-born Douglas took his own life in his studio flat in February of this year, the inquest was told
The Glasgow Rangers fan had been working as a forklift truck driver up until the time of his accident on the water slide
The inquest heard that in August 2021 having consumed a considerable amount of alcohol, Barry made the impulsive decision with Claire to break into Aldershot Lido
When the pair went down the water slide they slammed into a steel barrier that was blocking the end and sustained serious injuries
Reports at the time said they were then trapped for two hours before being rescued
Both Barry and friend, Claire Vickers, 46, appeared on ITV's This Morning in wheelchairs to talk about the incident
The inquest was also told that Douglas had a history of taking recreational drugs including cocaine and heroine
He had also spent a short time drug dealing and was stabbed in 2011, the inquest heard
Barry began experiencing a low mood and was known to drink between 500ml-1L of vodka a day, the inquest was told
His GP told the hearing that he had been prescribed anti-depressants following his lido accident
His mother, Ruth Douglas told the inquest that he had been desperate to get back to work after the accident
She added that doctors had told Barry that it might take up to two years to get his mobility back and that he was worried about being crippled
Barry's friends, having not heard from him for several days, contacted his tenant welfare officer who found him hanged in his flat in Aldershot in February 2022, the inquest heard
A post-mortem report read to the court stated that Barry had consumed a significant amount of alcohol before his death
Senior Coroner for Hampshire Christopher Wilkinson said that there was 'no clear explanation' for why Barry took his own life
Mr Wilkinson: He set himself up here in the UK
He started to consume alcohol to a greater extent and had been using street drugs
His [water slide] injuries were, in my opinion, life-changing
In his last few days there had been some hope that he was returning to work and was driving again
There was also a possibility that he was moving to other accommodation
It's regrettable that I cannot establish what he was thinking
He took his own life impulsively under the influence of alcohol, Mr Wilkinson added
The coroner recorded a conclusion of suicide

Ellen Martin, 25, from Surrey, said her life changed in a split second when she was diagnosed with the suicide disease which is so painful people often turn to suicide A footballer has described her daily living hell in which she feels she like she is being burned alive after a doctor diagnosed her with a horrifying disease
Ellen Martin, 25, from Surrey has played for women's teams including Aston Villa and Fulham, but after sustaining a knee injury while playing in November last year, her world was turned upside down
Six weeks after her operation to repair the torn ligaments, the sports coach noticed her leg would go from burning hot to ice cold and went back to her surgeon for answers
But Ellen was horrified when doctors told her you've been diagnosed with the Suicide Disease
The disease, which affects the central nervous system, causes indescribable pain and is usually brought on through trauma or injury
Medically known as Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS), the condition is nicknamed the suicide disease due to the number of people who would rather die than live with the pain
Ellen said: Instantly I turned to google to find out what CRPS was. .
and the result was the worst possible outcome I could have read
I immediately broke down, crying and screaming in tears
I feel like my body is being burnt alive
Imagine feeling like your body is being set on fire while being electrocuted
I just want my life back
Before the injury, Ellen had played for multiple football teams and enjoyed a healthy active social life
But now she claims her life has been put on pause, with doctors warning that the degenerative disease will slowly rob her of her functions and mobility as the pain worsens
She said: The McGill Pain Index, a scale rating of pain developed by McGill University, rates CRPS as the top pain humans can experience ahead of childbirth and amputation without anaesthesia
It is a living hell
My life has spiralled downwards from a split-second tackle in a football match
I have been unable to walk freely, sit in a chair normally, socialise with friends and family or work
My whole life has paused
The daunting reality of life with CRPS is isolating, terrifying and debilitating
My doctor hadn't even heard of the condition and believed the pain was 'inside my head'
I am already dosed up on medications that cause 'brain fog' and severe side effect on top of my CRPS pain
But despite the terrifying diagnosis Ellen says there is a glimmer of hope
After countless hours of research, the young footballer has found a clinic in the US giving hope to CRPS patients
Ellen has launched a GoFundMe to raise £30,000 to get her to The Spero Clinic in Arkansas, US for a 12 week intensive course which will treat her pain using holistic remedies
She said: I have found a glimmer of hope that I can return to the wonderful life I lived before my injury and diagnosis
I understand, just like myself, many may believe this is 'too good to be true', and naturally, I had these reservations, but when you're faced with the horrific reality of life with CRPS. .
going to this clinic will be the best thing I ever do
I have since spoken with numerous patients who have attended the clinic who are now in remission and honestly now believe it is the place I need to be
So please, if you can, help me on my journey to remission from CRPS
I will be forever grateful
It's impossible to articulate or put into words what the last five months have been like, so the thought of deteriorating further is truly terrifying

It's impossible to articulate or put into words what the last five months have been like, so the thought of deteriorating further is truly terrifying

Kieran, from Walsall, had increasingly isolated himself following relationship problems according to his sister and moved into shared accommodation rather than ask friends for help A sister whose golden-hearted brother took his own life hopes his death will help other men address their own mental health
Kieran Huntington took his own life last week despite appearing to be in good spirits, according to his older sister Danielle
Danielle says that 25-year-old Kieran had been dealing with ongoing mental health issues following the death of his mum when he was 17
She says Kieran, from Walsall, had increasingly isolated himself following relationship problems and moved into shared accommodation rather than seek help from family and friends
And now Danielle, 29, wants to use her family's tragedy to encourage men who are dealing with difficult circumstances to speak out
Birmingham Live reports that the alarm was raised for Kieran's welfare on Sunday, August 14, after his loved ones became concerned for him
Danielle, originally from Walsall but now living in Stafford, said: The ambulance turned up first, they did try resuscitation, the police and ambulance were in attendance
Instead of asking people for a place to stay, he felt like, as a man, he should have the responsibility for himself and moved into a house share
When he was 17, our mother died
He never sought help to move on from our mum's death
He struggled with it for the last few years
He was always just plodding along and carried on
Danielle hopes the death of her brother will shine a light on mental health and encourage other men who are struggling to seek help
Men should be more open and talk more, express their feelings more and don't keep them bottled up, she said
Whether that is to do with relationship problems, work problems, any problem that they have got, no matter how small or big, just talk about it rather than bottle it up inside
Kieran was a boyhood Liverpool fan and supported Walsall, which was his local team
He also played football and enjoyed fishing
He was a plasterer by trade but also played an active role in the family's dog training business DC K9
Danielle said Kieran was a popular young man with hundreds of friends, adding: I have been speaking to lots of people and they were saying he was laughing and joking all the time, even recently
He had hundreds and hundreds of friends
Paying tribute to her brother, she said: He was all-round nice, sometimes too nice
He would give his last penny to anybody that would need it

French financier Charles-Henry Kurzen jumped to his death from a luxury apartment he was viewing in a high rise New York block while he was being shown around by a real estate agent A French financier jumped from a luxury New York apartment in a high rise block after asking where the balcony was while he was being shown around by an estate agent
The 43-year-old man, identified as Charles-Henry Kurzen, fell from the 32nd-floor balcony at 100 United Nations Plaza which is in the Turtle Bay neighbourhood of Manhatten
He threw himself off the building at 1
15pm local time and landed on a third-floor patio, a police spokesman said
The financial banker, who was living in Brooklyn, had been taking a look at the apartment with a real estate agent when he then suddenly jumped, according to a source
Mr Kurzen was pronounced dead at the scene
A coworker didn't comment except to say that Mr Kurzen was a dear friend, reported the New York Post
He was a financier who graduated from the Ecole Superieure de Commerce de Paris (ESCP) Business School and was a partner at Saltbox Partners LLC
The company’s biography of him on its website showed that he had a long career working in French and US finance
Other roles that he has had includes an analyst in the the Mergers and Acquisitions Group at Lazard Freres & Co.  in Paris
Saltbox Partners website stated: Charles-Henry has been with Saltbox since the beginning
He has over 14 years of experience in the banking sector and has worked with Nina since moving to New York to start his project finance career at Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank where he was involved in the origination, structuring and execution of 15 financings of over $5 billion

Charles-Henry is a true practitioner who enjoys all the intricacies of non-recourse financings, and the challenges of bringing new deal profiles and sponsors to market
His experience has spanned financing coal mining development to the introduction of renewable power in South Africa
In conjunction with Saltbox’s work on Phase 1 of this landmark program, Charles-Henry wrote an article about this long awaited initiative by the South African government
He is a graduate of Ecole Superieure de Commerce de Paris (ESCP) Business School
The block of flat is close to the United Nations building in New York and a two-bedroom, two-and-a-half bathroom apartment on the 32nd floor is advertised for sale for $2. 9 million (£2. 29 million)

The American retail chain announced plans to close 150 stores out of its roughly 900, and sack 20 per cent of staff just two days before Gustavo Arnal's death in New York City A high-powered chief executive plunged to his death from the 18th floor of a famous tower after his company recorded record losses
Gustavo Arnal, Chief Financial Officer of Bed Bath & Beyond, took his life from the 18th floor of the famous 'Jenga' tower in lower Manhattan's Tribeca neighbourhood, New York City, on Friday
The American retail chain had been hugely struggling following the aftershocks of Covid-19 with high inflation and a sinking economy
The company announced plans to close 150 stores, of its roughly 900, and sack 20 percent of staff just two days before Mr Arnal's death
The announcement cause the business to lose nearly a quarter of its on Wednesday
He reportedly sold over 42,000 shares in the company for $1million just over two weeks ago, according to MarketBeat. com
But at the time of his death he still owned around $6. 5million in shares
Mr Arnal had only been with the company for two years and previously held the same role at British cosmetics giant Avon and had a 20-year career working overseas leading Procter & Gamble
Emergency service calls regarding someone jumping at 56 Leonard Street were recorded at around 12:30pm according to a spokeswoman for the New York Police Department
Beth, Bath & Beyond said it had secured $500 million in new financing but shares continued to plunge and fell as much as 25 percent in one mornings trading
When Mr Arnal joined Bed, Bath & Beyond in April 2020 a company spokesman said in a statement they were bringing in world class talent to offer new perspectives, expertise and experience as we rebuild our business
Gustavo exemplifies this and his experience delivering business transformation at other leading companies, his deep knowledge of the retail and consumer goods space, as well as his energy and drive will help accelerate our transformation plans
He held an undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Universidad Simon Bolivar in Colombia, and a master’s degree in Finance from the Universidad Metropolitana in Venezuela.
National Association of State Emergency Medical Services Officials were seen carrying the man's body in a black body bag
The building has 57 floors and is 243 metres high

On October 27, 2021, George was working at a property on Old Road in Cheadle adjacent to the railway lines
The apprentice builder was said to be visibly upset before taking a break - a short time later he stepped in front of a train A 'beautiful' teenager told his friends thank you for being the top lads you are in a final voice message moments before he took his own life, an inquest heard
George Thompson, 18, had been battling mental health problems and lows he described as ‘thunderstorms’ before his death
His dad, Dave Thompson, described George's death as the ‘hardest thunderstorm yet’
On October 27, 2021, George was working at a property on in Cheadle
The apprentice builder was said to be visibly upset before taking a break - a short time later he was hit by a train
He answered a call from his friend, Alex Mills, who urged him to step away and tried to tell him how much he had going for him
Unfortunately, George did not respond to these pleas
He was a wonderful young lad, his father told an inquest at the Coroner’s Court in Stockport
He was so caring and would do anything for anyone
He really loved helping people and he got a lot from that
He was everything you would want as a parent
He loved us and we loved him.  He was just everything
He was funny, so funny
At the drop of a hat he could just have us laughing
George was the most beautiful, caring, intelligent, reliable, funny, loyal, handsome, courteous, polite, son and brother a parent could ever wish for
There was so much to come but we shall have to treasure the memories we have.  But they’re not enough.  We wanted more
Mr Thompson explained that George's good moments far outweighed the bad, reports the Manchester Evening News
The lifelong Stockport County fan had often struggled with his mental health and previously tried to take his own life on September 15 but had misjudged when it was coming and was taken into hospital
He told the mental health team at Stepping Hill Hospital he was ‘gutted’ by what had happened
During the inquest, Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust were subjected to criticism from George's family, who could not believe the teen was assessed as low risk by the mental health team despite being considered a higher risk just three hours prior
The GP was shocked when I told him George was allowed home, Dave Thompson said
I can’t get away from the fact that three hours before he was classed as high risk but when he was in the room with Ms Dunne (conducting the mental health assessment) he was deemed low risk
There was almost no common sense thinking allowed and they have to stick to this criteria.  Everything seems so rigid
On a number of occasions throughout the inquest, Mr Thompson and his son Will both stated something needs to change
After George's death the trust conducted an investigation, which they say is a standard procedure when someone known to mental health services dies
No actions were put in place by Pennine Care as a result of the report but the trust says they listened to the family's concerns and staff have taken them on board
According to his therapist Mike Andrews, George was making progress in his battle with the ‘thunderclouds’ in his mind and was really engaged with his sessions as well as those he had with Karen Taylor of Healthy Minds
Both clinical professionals spoke highly of George and his determination to heal himself, but these ‘thunderclouds got the better of him in the end’, Mr Andrews said
After coming to a conclusion of suicide, assistant coroner Anna Morris said: It is hard not to have been moved by how much he was loved by all who knew him
George’s mum Caroline, dad David, and brother Will thanked all those who have supported them through this time including Stockport County football club, those assisting the coronal investigation and everyone who has shared wonderful stories of George

Indre Razutyte, from Pontefract, West Yorkshire, who was loved by everyone she met, was found dead in her garage on March 22, Wakefield Coroner's Court was told A mother who was loved by everyone she met took her own life at home, an inquest heard
Indre Razutyte, 31, was found unresponsive in her kitchen by her ex-partner on March 22
CPR was performed at the home in Pontefract, West Yorkshire, but Indre was declared dead
Suicide notes were found in the kitchen, Yorkshire Live reports
Indre leaves behind a two-year-old daughter
Wakefield Coroner's Court heard on Friday that Indre was much loved by her colleagues at small transport firm Centika Logistics
The mother was a transport manager there, and made such an impression on me immediately
Colleague Wayne Kearns, who joined the company in September last year, said: We're a small company, more like a family
Because of that I worked closely with Indre and we became good friends
She was like a little sister to me
She did used to sometimes talk about the issues she was facing, but it was such a shock to hear about her death and so heartbreaking
We'd spoken the day before when she was working from home
That day me and the manager had been messaging her because she hadn't come in
Losing Indre has felt like losing a member of the family
She was one of the nicest and kindest people I have ever met, she would help anybody
She was so nice, and I don't think she realised how lovely a person she was and how loved she was
I think she was worried about being left on her own
Indre's heartbroken family live in Lithuania, and are hoping to repatriate her home for a funeral there
Wayne and some of Indre's other colleagues have set up a GoFundMe page to help them pay for the costs of getting Indre home
As of April 8, the page is at £4,795
Any money left over from the fundraising will be put into a trust fund for Indre's two-year-old daughter
When we had drivers at the company who were having a bad day and would snap at anyone else, Indre was the only one who could calm them down
Customers would ask for her specifically
She could relate to anybody and I don't think she realised how great she was, Wayne added
She was really good at her job and just at talking to people
We always had a laugh in the office together
If she was feeling down I'd go to Morrisons and get us cake
Indre made such a big impact on me straight away
I wish I could've had the time to get to know her even better
The full inquest has been adjourned to a later date
Assistant coroner John Hobson did recount in brief the events that preceded Indre's death being recorded

Last Thursday, five family members jumped one-by-one of a seventh-floor apartment in Montreux, Switzerland
Police said the family had become steeped in conspiracy and survivalist theories and withdrawn from society Four members of the same family killed themselves in a suspected collective suicide leap from their seventh-floor apartment
A French family jumped one after another from their apartment in the Swiss town of Montreux, local police investigating the tragic mystery said today
They added that the family appeared to be fervent conspiracy theorists, hoarding food in their apartment
Only a 15-year-old boy survived the tragedy that happened last Thursday in the town on Lake Geneva, and he now remains in a coma in a stable condition in hospital
The Vaud regional police announced that their findings make it possible to rule out the intervention of a third party and suggest that all the victims jumped from the balcony one after the other
They are currently working on the theory of a collective suicide, they said
A 40-year-old man, his 41-year-old wife, her twin sister and the couple’s eight-year-old daughter along with the boy, all took the 20 metre jump from their apartment
France's Journal du Dimanche newspaper said the father, Eric David, grew up in a wealthy part of Marseille and even attended one of France’s most prestigious schools, the Ecole Polytechnique
The twin sisters, Nasrine and Narjisse Feraoun, grew up in a family of five children who were all educated at the elite Lycee Henri-IV in Paris
The mother was a dentist and her sister an ophthalmologist and the newspaper also said the twins were granddaughters of Algerian novelist Mouloud Feraoun
Police said that the family were withdrawn from society before their suicide
Two officers knocked on the apartment door at 6:15am local time, asking to speak to the dad about his son’s homeschool arrangement
However, after a voice asked who was at the door, they said nothing more and officers, unable to enter the apartment, left
Then, less than an hour later, just before 7am, all five leapt from the balcony within the space of five minutes
Police could find no evidence of a struggle, seemingly confirming that all of them jumped of their own accord
A step-ladder was also found on the balcony, where they jumped from
Police said: Before or during the events, no witnesses, including the two police officers present on the spot from 6:15 am and the passers-by at the foot of the building, heard the slightest noise or cry coming from the apartment or the balcony
Technical investigations show no warning signs of such an act
They added that since the start of the pandemic, the family had become increasingly interested in conspiracy and survivalist theories
The family lived in almost complete self-sufficiency, cutting off the outside world
They have amassed a stockpile of food, which took up most of their living space
Only the mother’s twin sister worked outside the home, with neither the mum nor eight-year-old registered with local authorities
Police added that the evidence suggested the family feared authorities interfering with their lives

The twin sisters, Nasrine and Narjisse Feraoun, grew up in a family of five children who were all educated at the elite Lycee Henri-IV in Paris
The mother was a dentist and her sister an ophthalmologist and the newspaper also said the twins were granddaughters of Algerian novelist Mouloud Feraoun
Police said that the family were withdrawn from society before their suicide
Two officers knocked on the apartment door at 6:15am local time, asking to speak to the dad about his son’s homeschool arrangement
However, after a voice asked who was at the door, they said nothing more and officers, unable to enter the apartment, left
Then, less than an hour later, just before 7am, all five leapt from the balcony within the space of five minutes
Police could find no evidence of a struggle, seemingly confirming that all of them jumped of their own accord
A step-ladder was also found on the balcony, where they jumped from
Police said: Before or during the events, no witnesses, including the two police officers present on the spot from 6:15 am and the passers-by at the foot of the building, heard the slightest noise or cry coming from the apartment or the balcony
Technical investigations show no warning signs of such an act
They added that since the start of the pandemic, the family had become increasingly interested in conspiracy and survivalist theories
The family lived in almost complete self-sufficiency, cutting off the outside world
They have amassed a stockpile of food, which took up most of their living space
Only the mother’s twin sister worked outside the home, with neither the mum nor eight-year-old registered with local authorities
Police added that the evidence suggested the family feared authorities interfering with their lives

Why he ended up in the Devon seafront hotel where Agatha Christie spent her wedding night and why he apparently ended his life there has never been established A chilling death that was compared to an Agatha Christie novel remains unsolved twenty-five years later
The man was found dead in a seafront hotel room in Torquay, Devon - the same town where the thriller writer was born
Mr Patel was found dead at the Grand Hotel and, next to his naked body, there was a glass of Coke which contained the poison cyanide
It turned out the room had been booked under a false name, with Mr Patel giving a fake home address in London
Mr Patel checked into the landmark hotel in September 1997 after having stayed for three days in the modest Lee's Hotel and Cantonese Restaurant, reports DevonLive
The mystery guest, in his mid-thirties, ordered room service and ate a meal of roast lamb, washed down with a glass of Frascati, an Italian white wine
His body was found by a chambermaid the next day, on the 24
His black suit, white shirt and multi-coloured tie were neatly folded on his bed, and on the bedside table was £94
12 in cash and an empty wine glass
But when the authorities were called in and tried to identify him, the lines of inquiry carried out the investigators found a series of dead ends
It was only due to a coincidence that a tantalising clue emerged
Two marks were seen on his shoulder, a sign that he was a member of the Tamil Tigers, a rebel group in Sri Lanka, an island state in the Indian Ocean
But why he ended up in the Devon seafront hotel where Agatha Christie spent her wedding night, and why he apparently ended his life there, has never been established
What did your local area use to look like? Find out with InYourArea's tool which takes you on a trip down Memory Lane
When the body was removed to the mortuary, coroner’s officer Robin Little spotted the marks on Mr Patel’s shoulder
The then South Devon coroner Hamish Turner later recalled: We spent a year trying to find out who this chap was
We even photographed his face and sent that photo around the country hoping someone would recognise him, but had no luck
It was perhaps a grim thing to do – but we had nothing else to go on because he carried nothing to identify himself
It was a lucky coincidence that the local forensic pathologist, Dr Guyan Fernando, is from Sri Lanka
He was told of these marks in a chance conversation with Mr Little and was able to tell us that the dead man must be from his country because these marks were the tribal sign of the Tamil Tigers, a rebel group in Sri Lanka

The cyanide was another clue that the dead man was a Tamil Tiger because, Mr Fernando said, they always carried a cyanide pill with them in case they were caught
Then there was a courteous note, penned by Mr Patel
It read: I am very sorry for what I have done here but this is the place I had to carry out the deed
To the chef, the food was magnificent – fit for the gods – for a final meal.  Thank you
Mr Turner said: I could only remark at the inquest that his reference to this place might be because he had read some Agatha Christie story and knew of her connection with the Grand Hotel
The dead man’s clothing was examined for clues to his identity but there were no laundry tags or marks that might help
He had a rather nice Parker pen which might have suggested he was an educated man, Mr Turner added, but despite months of investigation by the police we never discovered his real name or what he was doing in Torquay
It was, he added, the most baffling case of his career, and he could only now surmise that the dead man must have been running away from someone he feared, which was why he chose to end his life when he did
As to exactly why he died, and whether he was a devotee of Agatha Christie, I suppose we will never know

WARNING DISTRESSING CONTENT Eve Lewis, 15, was a popular and bright student but had struggled with anorexia in the latter part of 2020 in her quest for perfection A teenage girl who dreamed of becoming a lawyer went out for a walk with her dog but sadly never returned
Eve Lewis, 15, was hit by a train after going for a wander with her pet instead of out with her family on September 26 last year
The Lancashire schoolgirl dreamed of becoming a lawyer and was predicted top grades in her GCSEs
A popular pupil, Eve's family say she tried her best in everything and had recently discovered a new passion for both art and drama
They were not worried when she told them she would head out to walk the dog instead of joining them on a trip out last year and, while she battled anorexia, at times becoming painfully thin, relatives thought that she was over the worst of it and had her spark back
There was nothing to suggest that when she went out to walk the dog that day, that she wouldn't be coming home again, her family told LancsLive
There were no cries for help
Eve had so many things to look forward to and so many plans for the future
We don’t believe Eve wanted to die; she wanted to put an end to the torment she was in.  That torment was anorexia
Eve died after being hit by a train and her dog was later found running free in a nearby field by a passer-by
The talented youngster, who was in her final year at Burscough Priory Academy, had developed the eating disorder in the latter part of 2020 in her quest for perfection
Her mum Paula noticed she had lost a considerable amount of weight but, initially, Eve still appeared to be eating normal meals at home in Burscough
However, as 2021 started, and Eve was forced to home-school because of lockdown, she became obsessed with her food intake
By the Easter holidays she wouldn't even allow herself to enjoy the Sunday lunch her mum had made and her weight plummeted to less than six stone
By April 2021 mum Paula, a retired police officer, had become so concerned that she took Eve to see the GP who recorded her weight as just 37kg, or five stone eight pounds
The following day she was called by the eating disorder clinic who advised Eve's parents to not allow her to eat low fat food but after that she just refused to eat at all, her mum said
At an inquest at Preston Coroner's Court today, Paula said: We were told to persevere and we would spend hours every day trying to get her to eat
She would be crying, I would be crying and it was absolutely horrendous
It got to the stage where she was terrified of food
She would hold a fork up to her mouth and her hand would be shaking
In May 2021, as Eve's physical condition deteriorated and she became painfully thin, she attended an appointment with the eating disorder service's practitioners and a GP
The doctor was so worried about Eve's low heart rate, caused by starvation, that he sent her to A&E with her family advised to pack a bag as it was likely she would be admitted
Dr Johnstone told the inquest: I was particularly struck by the terrific efforts of mum and dad who had done everything to try and help her
They spoke of spending six hours a day trying to get her to eat
It was a very clear decision to admit her to hospital because despite all of that she was becoming more and more unwell
When she was admitted to Southport and Ormskirk District General Hospital, 15-year-old Eve weighed 36
55kg - five and a half stone
She was only allowed out of bed in a wheelchair because of her frailty and she told medics that she was worried she would lose control in hospital and become fat
She still had a sense of humour though, mum Paula told the inquest
I remember at one point they asked if she had any allergies and she said 'oil, fat, butter, sugar. . . . ' and was joking
After being warned that she would have to have a nasal feeding tube inserted if she continued to refuse food, Eve slowly began to eat while in hospital
By the time she was discharged, four weeks later, she had gained over 5kg
By September Eve, who was born in Ormskirk, had managed to gain more weight and she was deemed well enough to return to school
She asked her mum if she could have highlights put in her hair and her eyebrows tinted so that if anyone says I look different I can say that's why, Eve told Paula
Headteacher Lucy MacLaren described Eve as a beautiful girl' who loved netball and who contributed in every way possible to the school
See what’s happening near you by entering your postcode below or visit InYourArea The bright student, who could recite Pi to 40 digits, was part of a lovely group of friends who were very supportive
Eve was desperate to get better and had written a list of fear foods such as Ben & Jerry's ice cream and McDonald's, which she and her mum were ticking off one-by-one as she managed to try them
On the morning of Sunday September 26, the family were due to go out but Eve had stayed at home because she was worried a food situation would present itself and she would feel embarrassed
At lunchtime, Eve took the family dog out for a walk near to the train line close to their home in Ainscough Drive and spent 20 minutes talking to a friend on the phone
Emergency services raced to the scene shortly after 1. 35pm
Hayley Bevan was walking over the same trainline crossing and spotted a dog's lead and dog poo bags placed on the ground
She then walked on and saw the Lewis family dog running free

Just before Eve ran across the tracks she posted a heartbreaking message to her friends on Snapchat in which she thanked them for their support, the inquest heard
Assistant Coroner Laura Nash, who cried as she summarised the evidence, returned a conclusion of suicide
She also requested to see the family after the inquest to speak to them privately
After the inquest, Eve's family said in a statement that she had been tormented by anorexia
They said: Eve was just 15 years, one month and eight days’ old when her life ended
All of the superlatives we could come up with would still not do her justice
She was the most caring, loving, funny little girl who was an absolute pleasure to be around
She brought joy into the lives of everyone lucky enough to know her.  Eve was a perfectionist
She did everything to the best of her ability
She should have been taking her GCSEs this year and her grades were predicted to be 8s and 9s
She wanted to be a lawyer
Eve loved sports and exercise, and she was especially good at gymnastics
She enjoyed drama too, and had recently discovered that she was a talented artist
She had a great network of friends and was very popular at school
Unfortunately, in her quest to be perfect, she became anorexic
She was receiving treatment and improving daily
We thought that she was over the worst of it and had her spark back
There was nothing to suggest that when she went out to walk the dog that day, that she wouldn't be coming home again
There were no cries for help
Eve had so many things to look forward to and so many plans for the future
We don’t believe Eve wanted to die; she wanted to put an end to the torment she was in.  That torment was anorexia
Looking back, we believe that as Eve reached a normal weight range, rather than having her appointments with the eating disorder clinic reduced to once a month, she should have continued to be seen and given the opportunity for counselling without a parent present
Medication should also have been considered to help Eve’s mind cope with the changes, as we were told the brain is the last to recover
What is going wrong in our society that makes children and young adults feel they aren't good enough? They are
We wish Eve knew how wonderful she was
She was loved so much, by so many
We believe that Eve didn't tell us how she was feeling as she didn't want to worry or upset us
In her right frame of mind, she would never, ever have done anything to hurt any of us
We wish things could be different
We wish that we could have saved her

Sergey Protosenya, 55, is suspected of killing his wife Natalya and his daughter, 18, at their villa in Spain but his son Fedor insists his dad is not a killer A Russian millionaire accused of killing his wife, daughter and himself was actually murdered, according to his son
Former gas tycoon Sergey Protosenya, 55, allegedly beat his wife Natalya, 53, and 18-year-old daughter Maria to death with an axe at their luxury Spanish villa before killing himself
It is one of four recent 'suicides' of Russian gas business executives who are believed to be linked to Vladimir Putin's circle, with their deaths widely considered 'suspicious'
Catalan police are still treating the deaths as a double murder-suicide
But Mr Protosenya's son Fedor spoke out on Tuesday insisting that his dad was not a killer and could never harm his family
His comments come amid speculation that the crime could be a triple mafia murder disguised as domestic violence
The 22-year-old university student spoke after arriving at the Costa Brava resort of Lloret de Mar where his relatives were found dead at their holiday home on April 19
My father is not a killer
He loved my mother and especially Maria my sister, Fedor told Mail Online.  She was his princess
He could never do anything to harm them
I don’t know what happened that night but I know that my dad did not hurt them
Josep Milan, the head of the regional Mossos d’Esquadra police force for the province of Girona, which includes Lloret de Mar, gave a recent update on the case
Speaking ahead of Fedor’s comments, he said: Investigators are focusing on a person who has committed suicide and two other people found dead inside a property and that is what we’re looking at
Everything points to it being a domestic violence crime, a double murder and subsequent homicide
The police chief described reports pointing to the possible involvement of the Russian mafia in the crime as speculative
A Mossos source insisted nothing has changed since Mr Milan spoke last week
They added: This is still being treated as a double murder and subsequent suicide
Fedor had stayed behind at the family home in the French city of Bordeaux while his relatives travelled to Lloret de Mar to spend their Easter holiday at their Catalan villa
He raised the alarm through a friend of his father’s last Tuesday morning after his phone calls to the house went unanswered
The friend alerted police who found Mr Protosenya hanging lifeless from a noose tied to a garden railing and the bodies of his wife Natalya, 53, and their 18-year-old daughter Maria inside
Police have been working on the theory Mr Protosenya, who had been deputy chairman of major Russian gas firm Novotek, attacked his daughter with an axe and knife while she slept before murdering his wife in the same way and then taking his own life
Local reports in the aftermath of the gruesome discovery said Fedor was quick to raise the alarm when he could not reach his family by phone because he had been left disturbed by the last phone conversation he had with them last Monday evening
The Spanish Government Delegation for Gender Violence has already registered Sergey’s wife as the 12th person so far this year in Spain killed by her partner or former partner - and the 1,138th since records began in 2003
Spain’s Equality Minister, without waiting for the court investigation into the crime to be concluded, left little doubt she believed Mr Protosenya was to blame in her condemnation of the murders last week by describing them as gender-related killings in a press address
The results of the autopsies have not been made public as is normal in Spain, although the information being released on the ongoing probe into the crimes has been limited by a secrecy order placed over it by the investigating judge

Nine family members have been found dead after a suspected suicide pact due to financial problems
They have been described as caring and animal loving by locals A 15-year-old girl was among nine members of a caring and animal loving family who have been found dead in what appears to have been a suicide pact over financial debts
The bodies were found in two separate houses that belonged to two brothers from the family in the Sangli district of Maharashtra, India
Only two cats remain alive at one of the homes with the family described as caring and animal loving by locals with a vet, Dr Manik Vanmore, among the dead
Police believe that the nine people died after consuming poison and that the family was going through financial problems, reported Indian Express
Suicide notes refer to repeated and public harassment that the family suffered from money lenders which was both mental and physical, it is reported
The ages of the family range from a girl aged 15, to a 72-year-old woman
The brothers have been named as Popat Yallapa Vanmore, 52, and Dr Manik Yallapa Vanmore, 49
The seven other bodies were identified as Sangeeta Popat Vanmore, 48, Archana Popat Vanmore, 30, Shubham Popat Vanmore, 28, Rekha Manik Vanmore, 45, Aditya Manik Vanmore, 15, Anita Manik Vanmore, 28, and Akkatai Vanmore, 72
Footage taken at the scene shows the corpses lying inside rooms
They were found by locals who noticed the front doors had not been opened for some time
Sangli's District Superintendent of Police Dixit Kumar Gedam said: Nine dead bodies have been recovered in Mhaisal village of Sangli district, out of which three bodies have been recovered from one house and six dead bodies from the other house
The forensic team is present on the spot
A police investigation is currently under way, with officers registering an unnatural cause of death
The bodies will be sent for autopsies
Fifteen people from the region, who have allegedly lent money to the brothers, have been arrested and the police are searching for 10 more suspects, reported Indian Express
A family friend Ashwini Sawant said that they were a caring family
I literally grew up in their home, he said, All of them were very caring and considered me as one of them
From all the special dishes cooked at their home to all the major events, I have been there
Less than a week ago, I came to their house for a paani-puri party
They were a happy family and loved animals
But I also know that over the past few years, they have been under stress because of debt
But we had never imagined this

David Marsden, 22, was said to 'light up the darkest rooms' by his sister but the young man tragically took his own life after struggling with insomnia which began when a family holiday was cut short A young man who lit up the darkest rooms took his own life after he fell into a mental health spiral during struggles with insomnia
David Marsden first began suffering with the condition when a family holiday in 2019 was cut short
But following that the 22-year-old fell into a vicious cycle of becoming increasingly anxious at his normal life slipping away as his insomnia took over, the Manchester Evening News reports
The lab worker at Stepping Hill hospital suffered episodes of depression and anxiety and spent time on a psychiatric ward in the hospital where he worked
However, on November 21, 2019, months after the family holiday that was cut short, he was found dead in his family home in Stockport
His death triggered PTSD and insomnia in his older sister Charlene Marsden who has since opened up about his death
David's death turned the world of his sister, 33-year-old Charlene Marsden, and she said they had been like twins
She continued: We shared the same interests, the gym, Game of Thrones, all sorts of things
We would literally do everything together, and watch all the shows and movies together
He was literally my best friend
He was loved by so many people
And it's sad because my brother was the person who all his friends, family, and colleagues, including myself, would go to for advice and help when we were feeling low
He knew exactly what to say
His smile would light up the darkest of rooms, but unfortunately, when he found himself in a dark place there was just no way of getting him out of it
I don't think there's a lot of awareness of sibling grief and what it does to you, Charlene added
She said: They are the ones you think will be there when your parents pass
They are your past, your present, and your future so when you lose them at such a young age it's just so tragic and upsetting
I think I'll be dealing with this for the rest of my life
I probably cry most days about him to be fair
There will always be something that will remind you and you'll suddenly be in tears
But it's something I guess you learn to live with as hard as that sounds
You carry it around with you, and after a while, it gets lighter, but it's always there
Charlene struggled so much that she said she suffered from PTSD and her own bout of insomnia
She said: Last year before the inquest it happened to me
I can't even put into words what it was like
But I understood completely what he must have been going through
I had to have three months off work as my mum was terrified it was going to happen to me
I think it was just to do with the grief and the mental issues it had caused
I went three weeks without sleeping.  It was horrendous
Once you get up having not slept all night you become terrified of the evening that's coming next because you think 'am I going to lie there awake all night again
' Your appetite completely goes and you feel sick
You're running on empty, you're like a zombie
I had hypnotherapy, counselling, the lot
But I'm just pushing through as for me it's like I owe it to my brother
Just to show him that I can do it
Obviously it destroyed my brother and I'm not going to let it destroy me
I'm proving it to him, that it doesn't matter how bad things get, you can push through it
Charlene and her and David’s mum, Fiona Marsden, have set up a local support group for those bereaved by suicide
They hold monthly meetings and have now decided they are all going to climb Snowdon to raise funds for four charities close to their hearts
David’s much-loved niece 13-year-old Chantae is also taking part and his cousin Adrian, a former Royal Marine, is acting as a guide and support during the climb
Charlene said: We just want to spread awareness and raise as much as we can for these charities and I think that funding is vital at the minute as demand has gone up massively and there just isn't enough funding there
The climb will be a challenge but also really symbolic as I'm still climbing a mountain with my grief
But I truly believe it's helping
That's why it means so much to all of us
Charlene intends to sprinkle some of her brother's ashes at the summit
I know the views will be beautiful and he loved nature, she said
I am in awe of all the members
I'm in my thirties but several of them are older and have health issues
But we'll just take it at the pace of the slowest climber and if we reach the top we've done our bit for those who need our help the most
With mental health being paramount I go through life now with the motto 'in a world where you can be anything, be kind
' One small act of kindness could save a life and that's what will be driving us on the day

Manchester United fan Robert Davies, 33, had been partying in Blackpool and joking with family in the days and weeks leading up to his death A photo of a dad-of-two taken weeks before he took his life shows the signs aren't always clear, his family has said
Manchester United fan Robert Davies, 33, had been partying in Blackpool and joking with family in the days and weeks leading up to his death
Now his mum and sisters want others to see the pictures of an outwardly happy young man to raise awareness
Speaking to WalesOnline bereft mother Rachel said her home in Crickhowell feels empty since Robert's death
His family says support was lacking throughout his struggles and that while he received treatment for alcohol addiction they were never given a direct line for a support worker
Rachel says she's also struggled to find bereavement support and has had to resort to Facebook community groups
Robert is described as fun-loving and as mischievous as anything
The only thing the popular window cleaner adored more than football and his team Manchester United were his family and friends
But on November 30 he took his life days after enjoying a holiday in Blackpool and sharing photos of his trip with his girlfriend on social media
At home with her seven cats, three dogs, and 14-year-old daughter, Rachel points to the corner of the room beside her which is now Robert’s corner
His ashes sit in the middle of ornamental robins, candles, and a small glass house which reads: Special son, your light will shine forever inside our broken hearts
Her lounge is crammed with pictures of him - some with his two children aged 10 and four
Robbie is here with me forever, Rachel, 52, said.  I do believe that
They always say when robins appear, loved ones are near
Life is empty here now, that’s how I’d describe it
The only joy I get is when my grandchildren come to stay
How do you carry on doing normal daily things when you feel your life has come to a halt? It’s just day by day, or even minute by minute sometimes
It’s the waking up in the morning when you forget for a second that he’s not here, that’s the worst part, she said
Flicking through countless photos of her son, she continued: I would genuinely say he was one of the happiest and most outgoing people for much of his life
A super-friendly person who would walk into a group of people he wouldn’t know and would come out with many friends
Rachel smiles and laughs as she recalls funny memories which she now cherishes more than ever
At his nan’s birthday party only days before he died he brought out a cake for her with candles that didn’t blow out
He found it hilarious watching her trying everything to get these candles to stop
That sums up the type of person he was
It also shows how anyone can find themselves at their lowest ebb within days and when their family might least expect it, she says
Even in the days prior to his death Robert’s relatives said he had appeared to be as happy as he’d been in a long time, and had even decided to take his girlfriend on holiday
A picture taken of Robert in Blackpool shows him the week before he took his life, and it’s a picture Rachel wants others to see
Looking at the photo, she explained: By that point I think he definitely was suffering mentally and he tried to mask it with drink
He’d often drink a bottle of vodka a day which I’d put water in without him knowing
But he did seem to have become better prior to his death
He did seem to have picked himself up and then he’d have a bad week where he’d be really down
His friends would often say how they felt he was getting there, but maybe he was putting on a show to make people think he was okay
I want others to be aware that there are not always clear signs
The story about his nan not being able to blow the candles out was days before he died
The photos in Blackpool were taken a week before
By the time of his death Robert had worked hard to build his window cleaning business in Brecon and enjoyed speaking with locals - particularly those older than himself
The older folk really loved him, he’d spend half the time having tea and coffee with them, Rachel went on
He came home telling us all about them and the stories he’d heard
He’d often sit with them during the lockdowns to keep them company
It does show it can happen to anyone and that’s the saddest part
People don’t think this will ever happen to them or to anyone they know
A year before he died he’d have been the person in my life I’d have worried about the least
When his mental health dipped in the spring of 2021 Robert moved back in with Rachel, and she says they spent his final months watching copious amounts of sport on the television, sometimes until the early hours of the morning, to occupy his mind
He became my little boy again, she recalled
The night before he died Robert had fallen asleep drunk on the sofa
Rachel rang the doctors the following morning after he had told her he felt he wanted to take his life
She says she still feels guilty that she didn’t call the emergency services, but she feels let down that she wasn’t prepared for that moment
She claims Robert wasn’t offered any support other than for his alcohol dependency, even though he’d sometimes told specialists that he wanted to take his life in the months before he died
I rang the doctors and they said they’d call me back, but by the time they rang me back an hour and a half later Robert was dead, Rachel said
Not only did Robert not get enough support but we as a family didn’t get the support we needed
If we’d had appropriate guidance we’d have known what to do when Robert told us he wanted to take his life
We were in contact with mental health specialists but we were never given a direct number to contact or guidance on what to do in that scenario
There was no face to face support during Covid either
Everything was done over the phone - even the counselling for Robert for his problems with alcohol which he started in the March [of 2021]
He needed face to face help
On the morning of his death Robert told his mum he was planning on driving away from the house when she went to drop off her grandson at school, to which Rachel told him he couldn’t because he had been drinking
When I came back from dropping Jaxson off I was relieved to see Robert’s car still outside, she remembered
I knew he’d gone to his room when I got in the house but that was normal when he was particularly down
Sometimes he would go to bed and sleep the day away
I thought he was safe up there and that there was nothing up there that he could hurt himself with
I was heading up the stairs to tell him I’d rang the doctors when the police knocked on the door and said they were doing a welfare check
Then I was told he’d rang his ex-partner and friend to tell them he wanted to kill himself
They finally got his door open and told me to ring an ambulance
I felt completely numb, but I honestly thought he’d be okay
The paramedics and police worked on him for 40 minutes before telling me he’d gone
It didn’t feel real and still doesn’t feel real
How can you believe that someone who had been so full of life could be gone like that? I still think he’s going to walk through the door
How do you accept that your little boy is gone? Since Robert died Rachel says specialist support has also been few and far between and she's had to seek help on Facebook
She says there are lengthy waiting lists just for an initial phone call and charities are becoming overstretched
Robert’s sister Parisse said: There’s a serious lack of help for anyone these days
We need to encourage everyone, especially men, that there is no shame in speaking about your feelings
Too many young men are struggling in silence, we need to support one another

Police officer David Loudon left a family holiday in Wales early and killed himself and son Harrison while his wife and step-children were still away in a tragic set of events A police sergeant who was driven mad by the coronavirus lockdown gassed his three-year-old autistic son to death before killing himself
David Loudon, an officer with West Mercia police, was suffering from depression and anxiety, an inquest heard today
The bodies of the sergeant and his son Harrison were found at their Kidderminster home in August 2021 while the rest of their family were away on holiday
Mr Loudon left a suicide note for his wife saying she'd be better off without him
The court heard how the boy had recently been diagnosed with suspected autism and his behaviour was proving challenging
Covid and the subsequent lockdowns and restrictions had also led to Mr Loudon being unable to get the face-to-face medical attention he felt he and Harrison needed
He left the family holiday in Wales early and killed himself and Harrison while his wife and step-children were still away, Stourport Coroner's Court heard
Mr Loudon had meticulously planned the deaths and also left notes for his family and sent letters to his friends, explaining that he had decided to take his own life and the reasons why
Worcestershire Coroner, David Reid, returned conclusions that Mr Loudon had taken his own life while Harrison Loudon had been unlawfully killed
The inquest had heard how in the various letters and notes he left, he said he was now with Harrison and the angels in heaven, Birmingham Live reports
The tragedy happened at the Loudon's home in Cairndhu Drive, Kidderminster, on August 13 last year
Mr Loudon's wife, Sam, who is also a West Mercia Police officer, told how they had been at a caravan park in Rhyl with her two children and also her in-laws
She told how her husband had made it clear that he didn't want to be there as he was feeling very low in his mood and also felt physically unwell
Harrison was also having frequent meltdowns, the hearing was told
Three days into the holiday, it was decided that Mr Loudon would take Harrison home
In her statement read to the inquest, Mrs Loudon said she had lots of phone calls and text messages with her husband in the following days and everything seemed fine
But on the morning of August 13 she couldn't get hold of her husband on the phone
She also noticed on the camera the family had installed in Harrison's bedroom that he was in bed but hadn't changed position for several hours
I got a knot in my stomach - I knew something was not right, her statement said
I knew Dave was low but I had no idea that suicide was being contemplated, it was never discussed and wasn't a concern
She said a few months previously Mr Loudon had told her I think you and Harrison would be better off without me
She said she thought he meant he was going to leave them and never for a second imagined he was planning suicide
Mrs Loudon rang the police and they forced an entry into the house and found the body of Mr Loudon and Harrison in their respective bedrooms
A post mortem examination for both of them concluded they had died of asphyxiation
The inquest had heard how Mr Loudon went to his GP the year before this happened and said he was feeling low, depressed and anxious, but not suicidal
He was prescribed anti-depressants, but didn't take them, and also had six counselling sessions which were arranged by West Mercia Police
Detective Inspector Mark Walters from West Mercia Police, who carried out an investigation into the double-death, said they were well planned
He said an examination of his phone revealed extensive searches
Several notes and letters were found
One was for his wife, Sam, in which he spoke about his fears for Harrison’s future
I can’t watch Harrison regress and become scared and confused with the world around him
I can’t let that destroy us, the pressure and my diseased mind won out I couldn’t see that this would get anything than worse
He also wrote: The only way is to die, I couldn’t leave you with Harrison, it would be too much
I did it out of love and desperation
In her most recent statement, which was read out to the inquest, Mrs Loudon said: I felt devastated that he didn’t tell me how he was feeling - he had lost hope in everything
I loved him very much but it was an unforgivable decision, I wished he had told me
I will never be able to forgive David for taking the life of our little boy Harrison - he had no right to take my son’s life, regardless of how he was feeling

Jade Wilcott's family, from Plymouth, are campaigning for more awareness around mental health and say the mum was failed after losing her best friend and asking for help A heartbroken mum decided to end her own life after the sudden death of her best friend
Jade Wilcott's family told how defeated she must have felt to leave behind her daughter and most previous possession in life
She died overnight after a heart-to-heart with her granddad during which she had appeared to calm down, reports Plymouth Live
The 24-year-old struggled with her mental health which took a turn for the worst during lockdown after her friend and grandparents had to shield, and she felt extremely isolated
Despite her pleas for help, the young mum was failed, according to relatives who believe her death sends a clear message about the urgent need for mental health treatment
Jade was described as an intelligent, lovable and hardworking woman by family during her inquest at Plymouth Coroner's Court on Monday
Relatives said in a statement: Jade Elizabeth Wilcott was a beautiful, caring and thoughtful woman and mother
She was deeply loved by everyone who knew her
She struggled tremendously with her mental health from a young age and despite many times asking for help, she was failed
To take her own life, all must understand how defeated she must have felt leaving behind her most precious possession in life, her daughter Neveah
She will forever be missed
Jade's father told how his daughter had begged for help, which she should have received that same day
She messaged me that night and was saying that she needed help, he recalled
We ended up paying for private counselling because of the wait

The other thing that was affecting her was the Covid lockdown

She felt very, very, very isolated
And then the sudden death of her friend, all these things drove her to it
Jade, of Southway in Plymouth, took her own life in June last year and her family are now raising awareness following their devastating loss
Our message is that mental health treatment needs to be there for people, her dad added
Senior coroner Ian Arrow noted evidence gathered from a number of witnesses, including Jade's GP
In his report, he highlighted how Jade had a history of depression and that her last attendance at the surgery in January 2021 saw her state she was feeling anxious all the time

She was prescribed medication to tackle her depression and help her sleep
A report from Livewell Southwest noted it received a referral to their Liaison Psychiatry team on May 14, weeks before Jade's death
One mental health nurse noted that Jade had admitted to taking a quantity of pills after recently suffering a bereavement
But a risk assessment considered her to be a low risk of self harm and that she did not wish to end her life
The mum had told medical staff that she had acted on impulse
Her grandfather Robert Wilcott said in a statement how Jade and her sister regularly visited and stayed at his home

May 30 was one such occasion, when she stayed over after a night out with friends for a birthday party
Upon returning, she joined her granddad in the summer house and Robert recalled her clearly feeling down and despondent at one point saying she had had enough
The pair continued to talk about how she was feeling and Jade eventually appeared to calm down
The inquest heard how Jade told Robert she was going for a cigarette before he fell asleep
Robert's wife found her unresponsive the following morning and Robert made attempts to revive her

Toxicologists confirmed Jade had taken a combination of alcohol and a 'non-toxic' level of cocaine while a post mortem gave the cause of death as ligature compression of the neck
Robert told in his statement how her death was a terrible loss to her family and described her as a fantastic girl and an amazing mother to her daughter
Civilian investigator Phil Trevains told the inquest it was clear Jade had been upset following the death of her mother a few years previously, compounded with the death of a close friend just a few weeks before her suicide
He said medical reports showed she had struggled with her mental health and noted that counselling suggestions offered to Jade had come a little too late
The expert further highlighted the difficulties of accessing counselling during the coronavirus lockdown
Mr Arrow concluded that Jade had sadly taken her own life and expressed his profound condolences to her family of which many attended the inquest
He said: She was clearly a young lady who had a lot to offer friends, family and society

Brian Temple's mum described her son as happy go lucky but said the ordeal of incorrectly naming him as a paedophile caused him to become closed off and depressed An inquest heard how a man took his own life after police wrongly named him as a paedophile as a result of human error
Brian Temple was just 34-years-old when he died on December 31, 2017 - six months after being arrested on June 8 for allegedly stealing a pack of sausage rolls from Greggs
The inquest opened on Monday, June 20, and it heard that upon arriving home from custody, Mr Temple gave his release papers to his then-girlfriend, TeessideLive reports
Unbeknown to him, police had made an error in which they produced the wrong information on this document
The letter said he been in custody for inciting sexual relations with a 13-year-old girl, which he had not
Teesside Coroner's Court heard that Mr Temple's then-girlfriend began telling people of the incorrect information, which in turn caused people to lash out at the Redcar man
He was reportedly verbally abused in the street, attacked in his own home and hit around the head by a golf club
To deal with the onslaught he had experienced, the court heard Mr Temple began to drink heavily and take a mixture of both prescribed medication and recreational drugs, such as cocaine
Coroner Claire Bailey explained that a toxicology report carried out by Dr Cooper found Brian had 134mg of alcohol in his system
He was also found with a mixture of cocaine, Diazepam, Zopiclone and Pregablin - but these did not contribute to his death
Dr Cooper concluded that Mr Temple's death was as a result of hanging
His body was found by his brother Anthony, after his mum's partner, Paul Daley, became concerned that they had not heard from him all day
Coroner officer Nick Owen read statements from Mr Temple's brother Paul, sister in law Crystal and mum Mrs McLachlan, who has since passed away
His mum described her son as happy go lucky but admitted the ordeal with incorrect release papers caused him to become closed off and depressed
The court heard that after news spread of the release papers, Mr Temple reported threats and assaults to the police
The force's welfare checks reportedly made this worse and somewhat fuelled the fire of the incorrect rumours
His brother Paul, who was in attendance at the inquest at Teesside Magistrates Court, spoke of his closeness to his brother and how they'd grown up being anti-drug
Paul explained Mr Temple began taking drugs to cope with the constant attacks and assaults he was experiencing in the months leasing to his passing
Although he had depression, Paul said his brother never indicated suicidal tendencies and said the mistake on the release sheet would drive anyone mad

In her statement, Mr Temple's sister-in-law Crystal said the mistaken charge sheet was found in his pocket at the time of his death
She said she believed the police had a duty of care for vulnerable people such as her brother-in-law, as he was suffering from mental health issues at the time of his arrest
Officer Owen read out numerous statements from police officers who had dealt with Mr Temple in the run up to his death and around the time of his arrest and the incorrect papers being issued
Detective Sergeant Agar of Cleveland Police said in his statement that he had dealt with Mr Temple's complaint of the incorrect papers on November 28, 2017, and had said the bail sheet was a genuine human error
The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) began an investigation after Mr Temple's passing, so an error like this one would never happen again at Cleveland Police
They concluded that human error was the main judgement of the papers and this occurrence was incredibly unusual.  The inquest continues

Thoughts are with your family

A post-mortem examination found that Silvija, a warehouse operative from Dagenham, had no natural diseases, whilst a toxicology report found traces of alcohol and cocaine in her blood and urine
Mr Irvine said: It seems clear to me that Silvija did something that caused her own death, which was tying a ligature around her neck and hanging herself
It also appears to me that Silvija had taken herself to a place where she wouldn’t be interrupted, that would be private
There’s no indication from her actions that she was hoping someone would interrupt her or save her
I don’t think this was a cry for help
He continued: There is sufficient evidence to formulate a conclusion of suicide in this inquest
In a heartbreaking tribute to the mum, her sister-in-law Gabriella called her the strongest person she had known who was always helping others
She said: She was the eldest of five children
Silvija had a simple childhood although had several depression episodes as a teenager, nonetheless she continued to live and work in Lithuania
She moved to the UK several years ago
Living in London, she met her partner Tomas and her daughter was born from this union
Silvija always loved working and she was always helping others
She was a kind, loving mother, sister and friend
She was the strongest person we all ever knew but she heartbreakingly lost her battle with depression
Silvija will be forever remembered and loved by her mother, her siblings, her partner, her daughter and her friends
A GoFundMe to raise money for her family succeeded in raising over £3,000 after she died

WARNING, DISTURBING CONTENT: Semina Halliwell took her own life after an interview with police and her distraught mum has raised concerns about how her daughter's rape allegation was handled A heartbroken mum who raised concerns about how police handled her daughter's rape allegation has shared a haunting final photo taken days before she took her own life
Semina Halliwell, 12, died after spending four nights in hospital days after a police interview where she was made to feel like an inconvenience
Her grieving mum Rachel wants everyone to see the harrowing last picture of her little girl taken just days before her death last year, the Liverpool Echo reports
The Year 7 pupil from Southport, Merseyside, told police she was raped by an older boy who she said had groomed her over Snapchat
Rachel has now released a photograph of Semina taken in hospital just days before she died, as she raised concerns over how the youngster was treated after coming forward
The parent said Merseyside Police officers investigating the alleged rape made Semina feel like an 'inconvenience' and has complained to the Independent Office for Police Conduct
Rachel reached out to police after Semina broke down and told her about the alleged rape following a severe incident of self-harm
She says she wants the image released today to act as a warning to others on the devastating impact bullying can have on others
Rachel said a detective started talking about all the forms he'd have to fill in and how long it would take him to fill those forms in
The mother's aunt Clare Halliwell says the detective then told Semina: It's your word against his and do you really want this hanging over your head for 18 months, because it wouldn't go to court for 18 months to two years
Rachel says she believes police failed her daughter
Merseyside Police today said it was not appropriate to comment on the issues raised ahead of a planned inquest into Semina's death
A spokesperson for the force said: The matter is currently being considered by the Sefton, Knowsley and St Helens coroner and as such it is not appropriate for Merseyside Police to comment on any of the substantive issues raised at this time, as we would not wish to prejudice the coronial investigation
However, we have, and are, co-operating fully with the coroner in this matter
A spokesperson for the coroners' office also said they were unable to comment on this or any case that is under investigation
The spokesperson added: The date of inquest will be published in due course
Semina's tragic case was raised at a parliamentary committee on June 23, 2021, when Labour MP Apsana Begum asked then-Education Secretary Gavin Williamson what more could be done to help protect children from sexual harassment and abuse
Ms Begum said: I wanted to highlight the case of Semina who was 12 years old who disclosed that she'd been raped, and has committed suicide last week
Following her death, Rachel feared Semina's bullies would gatecrash her funeral
Rachel had initially said everyone is invited to celebrate Semina's short life, but she later received some horrifying messages
Screenshots seen by the publication appeared to show someone who knew Semina telling Rachel they had been told they'd get battered at the funeral if they attended
The message continued: I'm scared to go

Police officers were in attendance at the funeral, which went ahead without incident
But less than three months later, Rachel was left devastated after the grave of her 12-year-old daughter was trashed by yobs
In September, a family friend found Semina's grave had been completely desecrated
Rachel told the ECHO: It was covered in bricks and rocks and there was dog mess all over it
It was clearly done on purpose
At the time, Community Inspector Graham Fisher said the force and the community shared the family's shock and revulsion over the desecration of Semina's grave
He said This is the final resting place of a beloved family member, and I can only imagine how upsetting it must have been for their loved ones to find that the grave had been treated in this way
While thankfully no permanent damage has been caused, it will have caused lasting distress to the family
Merseyside Police today confirmed no charges or arrests have been made in relation to the attack on Semina's grave

Friends of Mehlika Derici watched in horror as her boyfriend clasped his arms round her waist and flung himself from the cliff in Turkey, dragging her with him to their deaths The chilling final words of a jealous boyfriend who threw himself off a cliff, dragging his beautiful girlfriend with him have been revealed by horrified witnesses
Police are investigating the suspected murder-suicide after the couple fell 82ft to their deaths, in Marmara Ereglisi, Tekirdag Province, Turkey, on August 6
Landowner, Selcuk Cetiner, 41, and beautician Mehlika Derici, 35, had been enjoying a meal with another couple to celebrate their friend's birthday, just hours before the tragic incident
After the meal the pair had gone with the other couple to a nearby lookout point known as Asiklar Tepesi, or Lovers' Hill
But a row broke out between them and Cetiner pushed Mehlika to the ground before friend, Merve Y, 32, and her boyfriend, Arda Tolunay Y, 26, picked her back up
Merve and her boyfriend Arda claim they heard Cetiner then shout if we die, we die together as clasped his arms round Mehlika's waist and dragged her over the edge, before she had time to react
Paramedics were called to the scene but were only able to declare them dead
The group had been drinking in the restaurant and had carried on at the viewpoint
The couple's bodies were taken to the morgue at Marmara Ereglisi Public Hospital, while police seized their mobile phones for analysis
Some local reports said Mehlika was mother to two children
Femicide is a growing problem in Turkey, particularly after the country officially quit the Istanbul Convention in July last year
According to the 2021 Annual Data Report by the 'We Will Stop Femicide Platform', 280 women were killed by men in 2021, while 217 women were found suspiciously dead
According to data from the 'Monument Counter' - a digital memorial for women killed by violence that is updated daily - 246 femicides have taken place in Turkey so far this year

Child poverty charity The Childhood Trust today revealed how children have been impacted by the ongoing cost of living crisis - being left having self-harming and suicidal thoughts due to money worries Children are having suicidal thoughts because of the cost of living crisis, a report found
Britain is facing a ­humanitarian crisis on our doorsteps with children self-harming and unable to sleep because of money worries
Child poverty charity The Childhood Trust has today released a 33-page report into the effect the crisis is having on disadvantaged youngsters
They are warning millions of children are at breaking point
One little girl said she watches telly to try to forget her hunger
Laura, seven, of London, said: I ask my mother if we’ve any food and she’ll tell me if there’s enough money
If there isn’t then I just go in the cupboards and see if there’s something
If there’s a snack, I’ll eat it and try to go to bed
Tomorrow she might have more money
Another girl said: My mum was trying to pay for the electricity and we didn’t really have enough.  I felt really sad
It was really cold and I was really scared because the heater wasn’t working
The research by the Childhood Trust involved 1,468 parents, some to people aged over 18, with a third saying their children had been affected by the crisis
Of these 483 parents, nearly half said their kids are stressed, and a fifth said they smile less now
Nearly one in 10 reported children who have started self-harming while 8% said their kids have displayed suicidal tendencies
The Childhood Trust is aiming to raise £3
5million to help ­those in need
Chief executive Laurence ­Guinness said: It’s only thanks to donors and the thousands of ­charities supporting children that we aren’t facing a humanitarian crisis on our own doorsteps.  Donate at: championsforchildren. childhoodtrust. org

New research by Deaths by Welfare concludes the Department for Work and Pensions failed to fix systematic flaws in the disability benefits system that potentially led to thousands of deaths You can listen to an audio version of this article here The Government’s failure to act on warnings about its disability benefits systems has been linked to hundreds – maybe even ­thousands – of suicides and other deaths of disabled people
A detailed 160-page study published today exposes how the Department for Work and Pensions was alerted more than 40 times to life-threatening systemic flaws, by academics, coroners and its own researchers over the past 30 years
The Mirror has been given exclusive access to the Deaths by Welfare Timeline, which brings together for the first time the three decades of ­investigations linking DWP and its social security reforms with the deaths of disabled benefit claimants
It documents the DWP’s cumulative harm and slow bureaucratic violence that has led to countless suicides and other deaths, particularly in the post-2010 austerity era
One piece of research connects just one area of the 2010 coalition government’s welfare reforms with an extra 590 suicides between 2010 and 2013
By Rachel Charlton-Dailey, guest editor and founder of The Unwritten Disabled Britain: Doing It For Ourselves, is a week-long series across the Daily Mirror's print and digital platforms, showcasing the lives of disabled people and the issues important to us
The articles have been conceived by disabled people, written by disabled people, and photographs - where possible - taken by disabled people
Throughout this week, we aim to change your mind about how you view disabled people
After all, there are 14 million of us, and we aren’t all the same, it’s time the public stopped listening to lazy stereotypes and viewed disabled people in all our wide-ranging splendor
To read more on The Mirror's week-long series click here Disabled activist Ellen Clifford, author of The War on Disabled People, who provided key input into the Timeline, said it was an enormously important piece of work
She said: Welfare reform has destroyed lives and caused avoidable harm on such a scale that the United Nations made a [2016] finding of grave and systematic violations of ­disabled people’s rights
At the most extreme end this has meant the loss of life
We will probably never know the true number
The culture of dehumanisation and hostility fostered within the DWP to justify the government’s conscious cruelty has meant a complete lack of ­accountability or remorse
The Timeline ­represents an important step in the continuing battle for justice for the victims of welfare reform
Work and pensions ministers have repeatedly been warned of the harm caused by the assessment system, mostly to claimants of out-of-work disability ­benefits such as ­incapacity benefit and employment and support allowance but also the personal independence payment, which was introduced in 2013
As far back as 1995, Professor Nick Wikeley, who would later become an Upper Tribunal judge, was warning new social security legislation would leave marginal groups with ­inadequate protection against the risk of long-term illness
In 2006, Professor Alison Ravetz warned that if the then Labour government was wrong about its proposed incapacity benefit reforms the cost, in stress, to those people and their families will be ­incalculable
Those reforms were rolled out, first under Labour and then – with even harsher restrictions – under Tory-led governments
In March 2010 came the first indication from a coroner the reforms – the work ­capability ­assessment (WCA) and the ­employment and support allowance (ESA) – were having the impact of which Ravetz had warned
Stephen Carré, 41, had taken his life two months earlier after his appeal against being found fit for work was rejected
Coroner Tom Osborne said this trigger led to his suicide, and urged changes to the WCA
In April 2012, Colin Traynor, 29, died following a seizure, after months of growing anxiety about his finances and being wrongly found fit for work
Five months later, Labour’s Michael Meacher became one of the first MPs to speak in parliament about the controversial medical assessments
Sadly, Colin was not an isolated case, he said at the time
Dad Michael O’Sullivan, 60, of North London, took his life in September 2013, again after being found fit for work and ineligible for ESA
He had been claiming incapacity benefit since 2000, due to depression, social anxiety and agoraphobia
To read more content from our week-long series on Disabled Britain click here
In January 2014, coroner Mary Hassell linked his death to the WCA, warning of a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken.  The needless deaths continued. .
Jodey Whiting, 42, took her life in February 2017, after being told by the DWP she had been found fit for work
DWP’s assessors had noted the severity of her mental health ­condition, and the risk posed if she was found fit for work
Two years after her death, the DWP’s Independent Case Examiner found the department had failed five times to follow its safeguarding rules
Errol Graham’s body was discovered by bailiffs who had been sent to evict him in June 2018
He had starved to death, months after DWP wrongly stopped his ESA, and weighed 4st 7lb
In January 2020, Jodey and Errol, 57, were mentioned in the House of Commons with a demand by Labour’s Debbie Abrahams for an independent inquiry
Errol’s daughter-in-law Alison Burton said: It makes us angry and frustrated
You can’t put into words the devastation that department has caused
It just doesn’t seem to care
Debbie Abrahams, a former Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, said: I don’t want any more families like Jodey Whiting’s, Errol Graham’s and hundreds, possibly thousands, more to go through the pain that they have
I have been calling for a public inquiry into the scale and causes of the deaths of social security claimants from 2008 to date
Despite all of this, the ­Government has refused to listen
Claimants continue to lose their lives because of DWP failings
A ­disabled woman, who her family claims was traumatised by the daily demands of the universal credit system, took her life two months ago

It said: These are tragic, complex cases and our sincere ­condolences remain with the families
We continually improve our services and have new teams to focus on our most vulnerable customers
The timeline, which is being published today in draft form before being launched officially later this year, is part of the Deaths by Welfare project headed by Dr China Mills and supported by Healing Justice Ldn (CORR), which works with marginalised and oppressed communities
Dr Mills has led the work on the timeline alongside John Pring, editor of Disability News Service, with key input from disabled activist Rick Burgess, disabled activist and author Ellen Clifford, welfare rights expert and researcher Nick Dilworth, and disabled artist-activist Dolly Sen
Dr Mills, Senior Lecturer in Public Health, said: We may never know the names of all of those who have died – the lives lived and lost
But we’re seeking people’s feedback, to remember those who have died and to reimagine welfare justice

By Rachel Charlton-Dailey, guest editor and founder of The Unwritten Disabled Britain: Doing It For Ourselves, is a week-long series across the Daily Mirror's print and digital platforms, showcasing the lives of disabled people and the issues important to us
The articles have been conceived by disabled people, written by disabled people, and photographs - where possible - taken by disabled people
Throughout this week, we aim to change your mind about how you view disabled people
After all, there are 14 million of us, and we aren’t all the same, it’s time the public stopped listening to lazy stereotypes and viewed disabled people in all our wide-ranging splendor
To read more on The Mirror's week-long series click here Disabled activist Ellen Clifford, author of The War on Disabled People, who provided key input into the Timeline, said it was an enormously important piece of work
She said: Welfare reform has destroyed lives and caused avoidable harm on such a scale that the United Nations made a [2016] finding of grave and systematic violations of ­disabled people’s rights
At the most extreme end this has meant the loss of life
We will probably never know the true number
The culture of dehumanisation and hostility fostered within the DWP to justify the government’s conscious cruelty has meant a complete lack of ­accountability or remorse
The Timeline ­represents an important step in the continuing battle for justice for the victims of welfare reform
Work and pensions ministers have repeatedly been warned of the harm caused by the assessment system, mostly to claimants of out-of-work disability ­benefits such as ­incapacity benefit and employment and support allowance but also the personal independence payment, which was introduced in 2013
As far back as 1995, Professor Nick Wikeley, who would later become an Upper Tribunal judge, was warning new social security legislation would leave marginal groups with ­inadequate protection against the risk of long-term illness
In 2006, Professor Alison Ravetz warned that if the then Labour government was wrong about its proposed incapacity benefit reforms the cost, in stress, to those people and their families will be ­incalculable
Those reforms were rolled out, first under Labour and then – with even harsher restrictions – under Tory-led governments
In March 2010 came the first indication from a coroner the reforms – the work ­capability ­assessment (WCA) and the ­employment and support allowance (ESA) – were having the impact of which Ravetz had warned
Stephen Carré, 41, had taken his life two months earlier after his appeal against being found fit for work was rejected
Coroner Tom Osborne said this trigger led to his suicide, and urged changes to the WCA
In April 2012, Colin Traynor, 29, died following a seizure, after months of growing anxiety about his finances and being wrongly found fit for work
Five months later, Labour’s Michael Meacher became one of the first MPs to speak in parliament about the controversial medical assessments
Sadly, Colin was not an isolated case, he said at the time
Dad Michael O’Sullivan, 60, of North London, took his life in September 2013, again after being found fit for work and ineligible for ESA
He had been claiming incapacity benefit since 2000, due to depression, social anxiety and agoraphobia

In January 2014, coroner Mary Hassell linked his death to the WCA, warning of a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken.  The needless deaths continued. .
Jodey Whiting, 42, took her life in February 2017, after being told by the DWP she had been found fit for work
DWP’s assessors had noted the severity of her mental health ­condition, and the risk posed if she was found fit for work
Two years after her death, the DWP’s Independent Case Examiner found the department had failed five times to follow its safeguarding rules
Errol Graham’s body was discovered by bailiffs who had been sent to evict him in June 2018
He had starved to death, months after DWP wrongly stopped his ESA, and weighed 4st 7lb
In January 2020, Jodey and Errol, 57, were mentioned in the House of Commons with a demand by Labour’s Debbie Abrahams for an independent inquiry
Errol’s daughter-in-law Alison Burton said: It makes us angry and frustrated
You can’t put into words the devastation that department has caused
It just doesn’t seem to care
Debbie Abrahams, a former Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, said: I don’t want any more families like Jodey Whiting’s, Errol Graham’s and hundreds, possibly thousands, more to go through the pain that they have
I have been calling for a public inquiry into the scale and causes of the deaths of social security claimants from 2008 to date
Despite all of this, the ­Government has refused to listen
Claimants continue to lose their lives because of DWP failings
A ­disabled woman, who her family claims was traumatised by the daily demands of the universal credit system, took her life two months ago

It said: These are tragic, complex cases and our sincere ­condolences remain with the families
We continually improve our services and have new teams to focus on our most vulnerable customers
The timeline, which is being published today in draft form before being launched officially later this year, is part of the Deaths by Welfare project headed by Dr China Mills and supported by Healing Justice Ldn (CORR), which works with marginalised and oppressed communities
Dr Mills has led the work on the timeline alongside John Pring, editor of Disability News Service, with key input from disabled activist Rick Burgess, disabled activist and author Ellen Clifford, welfare rights expert and researcher Nick Dilworth, and disabled artist-activist Dolly Sen
Dr Mills, Senior Lecturer in Public Health, said: We may never know the names of all of those who have died – the lives lived and lost
But we’re seeking people’s feedback, to remember those who have died and to reimagine welfare justice

Ellen Martin, 25, from Surrey, said her life changed in a split second when she was diagnosed with the suicide disease which is so painful people often turn to suicide A footballer has described her daily living hell in which she feels she like she is being burned alive after a doctor diagnosed her with a horrifying disease
Ellen Martin, 25, from Surrey has played for women's teams including Aston Villa and Fulham, but after sustaining a knee injury while playing in November last year, her world was turned upside down
Six weeks after her operation to repair the torn ligaments, the sports coach noticed her leg would go from burning hot to ice cold and went back to her surgeon for answers
But Ellen was horrified when doctors told her you've been diagnosed with the Suicide Disease
The disease, which affects the central nervous system, causes indescribable pain and is usually brought on through trauma or injury
Medically known as Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS), the condition is nicknamed the suicide disease due to the number of people who would rather die than live with the pain
Ellen said: Instantly I turned to google to find out what CRPS was. .
and the result was the worst possible outcome I could have read
I immediately broke down, crying and screaming in tears
I feel like my body is being burnt alive
Imagine feeling like your body is being set on fire while being electrocuted
I just want my life back
Before the injury, Ellen had played for multiple football teams and enjoyed a healthy active social life
But now she claims her life has been put on pause, with doctors warning that the degenerative disease will slowly rob her of her functions and mobility as the pain worsens
She said: The McGill Pain Index, a scale rating of pain developed by McGill University, rates CRPS as the top pain humans can experience ahead of childbirth and amputation without anaesthesia
It is a living hell
My life has spiralled downwards from a split-second tackle in a football match
I have been unable to walk freely, sit in a chair normally, socialise with friends and family or work
My whole life has paused
The daunting reality of life with CRPS is isolating, terrifying and debilitating
My doctor hadn't even heard of the condition and believed the pain was 'inside my head'
I am already dosed up on medications that cause 'brain fog' and severe side effect on top of my CRPS pain
But despite the terrifying diagnosis Ellen says there is a glimmer of hope
After countless hours of research, the young footballer has found a clinic in the US giving hope to CRPS patients
Ellen has launched a GoFundMe to raise £30,000 to get her to The Spero Clinic in Arkansas, US for a 12 week intensive course which will treat her pain using holistic remedies
She said: I have found a glimmer of hope that I can return to the wonderful life I lived before my injury and diagnosis
I understand, just like myself, many may believe this is 'too good to be true', and naturally, I had these reservations, but when you're faced with the horrific reality of life with CRPS. .
going to this clinic will be the best thing I ever do
I have since spoken with numerous patients who have attended the clinic who are now in remission and honestly now believe it is the place I need to be
So please, if you can, help me on my journey to remission from CRPS
I will be forever grateful
It's impossible to articulate or put into words what the last five months have been like, so the thought of deteriorating further is truly terrifying

Baggage handler Richard Russell, 29, was wearing a T-shirt with The Sky's No Limit written on his back as he opened the door of an Alaskan Airlines propeller jet, jumped in the cockpit and flew 30 miles before taking his own life when he crashed on a remote island A clip has surfaced showing the moment an airport worker hijacked a plane before plunging the aircraft through the air and crash landing on a remote island in an apparent suicide
Surveillance footage from Seattle Airport shows baggage handler Richard Russell, 29, moving through the transit hub wearing a a T-shirt with The Sky's No Limit emblazoned across the back
The clip, recorded in August 2018, then shows Russell heading towards the airport's cargo area around five hours after clearing security
With colleagues walking nearby, he's seen pushing an Alaska Airlines propeller aircraft on to the runway
Air traffic agents tried to make contact with the plane but received no response
He then opens the cabin door, jumps in the cockpit and takes off in the Q400 Turboprop - which is designed for short to medium haul journeys
He tells air traffic control: Seattle ground Horizon guy.  About to take off.  It's gonna be crazy
Hey, I found myself in a predicament
I'm in the air right now
And just gonna soar around
As he soars above Washington state as air traffic controllers beg him to make a safe landing
But Russell won't be swayed and continues to make disturbing jokes with the men in the tower trying to find somewhere he can set the plane down
He says: Hey do you think if I land this successfully Alaska will give me a job as a pilot? After asking if he could see a suitable runway, he replies: Oh those guys will try to rough me up if I try land there… I think I might mess something up there too
I wouldn't want to do that
Oh they probably have got anti-aircraft
The traffic controller responds: They don't have any of that stuff, we are just trying to find you a place to land safely
At one point, he says he's just a broken guy and that he is preparing for jail time for life
According to the Seattle Times, he said he feared disappointing people that care about me by hijacking the aircraft
He added: I would like to apologise to each and every one of them
Just a broken guy, got a few screws loose, I guess
Never really knew it, until now
Moments after the plane took off, two US F-15 fighter jets headed to his position but couldn't intercept him before his tragic descent
Russell crashed on a remote island 30 miles away from Seattle
He died around 90 minutes after taking off
People on the ground reported seeing him performing aerial acrobatics, including barrel rolls and loop-the-loops in the air
Sheriff Paul Pastor said Russell's was like a joyride gone terribly wrong
An FBI report revealed how Russell said he knew how to fly the aircraft solo because he'd played video games in the past
The report said there was no clear motivation for his bizarre actions after investigators probed his background, possible stressors and personal life

Benjamin Davis, from Greater Manchester, was given the reference in the context that his autism diagnosis was. .
part of him but not all of him, a court heard A 22-year-old took his own life after being given a gravestone reference during a therapy session, a court heard
Benjamin Davis, also known as Binyomin Chaim Davis, took his own life only a few months after the session, having never got over that experience, his dad said
The young man was found at his home in Prestwich, Greater Manchester, and died at Salford Royal Hospital in November five days later
An inquest was held at Bolton Coroner's Court on Wednesday where private counsellor Avremi Rosenberg admitted that he should have used different wording in his session with Benjamin, who was 21 at the time
He also accepted that the language was inappropriate, reports Manchester Evening News
Mr Davis, Benjamin's dad, told the court that his son had a charming smile and was a special person
Speaking at the inquest, he said: We really miss him
He had a kind nature with a charming smile
He was a great student, he enjoyed photography, walking, and spending time with his family
He was a real pleasure to be with and he’s missed by family and friends
Despite his academic prowess, Benjamin struggled initially to fit in at school but eventually made a close knit group of friends
His challenges at school meant Benjamin was diagnosed with depression and anxiety in 2018, Mr Davis continued
The youngster was also diagnosed with autism in 2021, assistant coroner Rachel Syed heard
After this diagnosis, Benjamin had five counselling sessions with Mr Rosenberg in spring last year
And it was during these sessions in which Mr Rosenberg referenced a gravestone, Mr Davis said
He added: I asked Mr Rosenberg about it and he confirmed he did [say it]
When asked why used the imagery, Mr Rosenberg said he said 'in the context that his autism diagnosis was… part of him but not all of him'
He added: Benjamin approached me because he knew I was a counsellor with experience with working with people on the autism spectrum
In hindsight, this would have been better dealt with by the NHS
I did apologise to Benjamin for the way it came over
It was definitely not said in a blunt way
It was very much in the context that his autism diagnosis was very important and it was part of him but not all of him, and in that context what would be written on his gravestone
In the future whatever I can do to help you to come to terms about what has happened, I would properly arrange it
I express my sincerest, sincerest condolences
When asked by the coroner if his choice of words was inappropriate, Mr Rosenberg replied: Definitely, yes
Ms Syed said at the conclusion of the hearing that she would be writing a letter of concern to Mr Rosenberg’s organisation
She also will be writing letters of concern to Benjamin’s GP surgery Whittaker Lane Medical Centre and Greater Manchester Mental Health Trust (GMMH)
The coroner explained: A formal letter of concern will be written to the GP, GMMH, and the private organisation, highlighting the need to ensure a more collaborative working approach between these organisations and sharing information such as diagnoses of autism
I will also reference the need to have more training on autism as a condition
Earlier in the hearing, Benjamin’s GP in the final months of his life, Dr Rebecca-Ann Sheppard-Hickey, said she could not find a record of a formal autism diagnosis in his notes
Dr Ruth Watson, from GMMH, carried out an internal review of Benjamin’s care, and also admitted mistakes were made with clinical staff now receiving more in-depth training on autism
She said: The main focus is that staff need additional training on autism
It is going to be added to our clinical risk training as an additional focus point
Dr Watson did however add it was difficult to say if Benjamin’s death was preventable from the perspective of mental health services, as his last involvement with the service came around two months before his passing
Recording a verdict of suicide, Ms Syed confirmed that Benjamin’s medical cause of death was hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy
She concluded: I am sadly satisfied to the relevant legal threshold [Benjamin] intended to take his own life
I am therefore in law required to record a verdict of suicide
I hope you can focus on the wonderful memories you have of Benjamin

Richard Farquhar, 61 - who murdered his wife in a jealous rage over an affair - took his own life after his release from prison was stalled and he was suspended from his charity shop job A murderer who killed his wife after discovering she was having an affair later took his own life in jail
Richard Farquhar became depressed about the possibility of delaying his release and after losing his prison placement at a charity shop
The 61-year-old was being held in HMP Greenock, in Inverclyde, Scotland, and, nearing the end of his sentence, had been moved to less restrictive procedures, including being given the new job
But he was suspended after his placement supervisor began to feel increasingly uncomfortable, according to a sheriff's report
Farquhar's mental health started to deteriorate after prison chiefs stopped moves to prepare him for release
A fatal accident inquiry was held virtually at the town’s sheriff court, with submissions made in February
Sheriff Andrew McIntyre issued a judgement in relation to the inmate's death on March 14, 2019
The determination was published earlier this month
Mr McIntyre said Farquhar died at 1am at Inverclyde Royal Hospital as a result of an injury sustained within a cell between 3
30pm and 4pm on March 13
Mr Farquhar’s death did not result from an accident, he added
The killer was sentenced to life with a minimum of 12 years for the murder of wife Anne in 2008 on the A90 road near Aberdeen, Scotland
The High Court in Edinburgh heard how she had kicked him out of their home in Cove Bay, Aberdeenshire, after she discovered he was having an affair with her friend
Anne then began seeing the same woman's husband and Farquhar stabbed her to death
Mr McIntyre said officials failed to provide him with detailed plans on what he needed to do to work towards his release or on how to access sessions with a psychologist
He concluded that if these actions had been taken the inmate's death may have been avoided
He said: I have found that Mr Farquhar committed suicide following a decline in his mental health contributed to by his suspension from a community placement
I have found that in the days and weeks prior to his death his imminent risk of suicide could not have been detected
I have also found that, as a result of the systems of working in place within HMP Greenock, and as a result of certain other factors, opportunities to safeguard Mr Farquhar’s mental wellbeing in the period before his death were missed
In particular I have found that: delay, a lack of joined-up working, and insufficient communication with Mr Farquhar, all contributed to him becoming distressed by his lack of progress, and to opportunities to avert that distress being missed

I find that those omissions contributed to his death
I find no cause for criticism of any of the professionals involved; it has only been possible to identify how things could have been done differently with the benefit of hindsight
I have made recommendations which I believe, if implemented, might realistically prevent other deaths in similar circumstances
The sheriff recommended several new guidelines for dealing with prisoners before release

Medic Abhijeet Tavare, who joined the world-famous McKinsey management company after graduating, was found by his friends who went looking for him on the middle of the night An Oxford University -trained doctor whose life was shattered when he caught long Covid took his own life because he could not cope with the illness anymore, an inquest heard on Wednesday
The high-flying medic, who joined the world-famous McKinsey management company after graduating, was found by his doctor friends who went looking for him on the middle of the night
A coroner heard that 27-year-old Abhijeet Tavare's mother had returned to their home on London Road, Bushey, Herts, after her usual morning walk, only to realise something was wrong
She went into her son's bedroom and found his suicide notes
In a statement from Abhijeet's GP which was read to the inquest, it was revealed that the son, known as Abhi to friends, had contracted Covid- in September 2020, which he initially recovered from, only for symptoms of long Covid to emerge
The inquest in Hertford was told that he reported he was suffering from palpitations, difficulty sleeping, extreme fatigue, as well as cognitive decline caused by brain fog
The latter meant he could no longer work for the international management consulting company and moved back home with his mother
He had already seen five different doctors and therapists for his physical and mental health issues, all to no avail
He was prescribed sleep medication by his GP and it was recorded in the inquest that no mention of self-harm or suicidal ideation was reported
A statement from police constable Holly Edwards, read: Police received a phone call from Abhijeet's sister-in-law, saying he wasn't in his room and had left notes, saying he could no longer live with his illness and didn't want to suffer anymore
His mum woke up and went for a walk
She got back and noticed he hadn't left his bedroom
She opened his door and he wasn't there
Then she found the letters and immediately called his sister-in-law, who then called police
Officers declared him a high-risk missing person and began a search after finding CCTV of where the car he was driving was last spotted
Meanwhile, his closest friends - all junior doctors - heard the news he was missing and formed a search party
Get the stories you want straight to your inbox
Sign up to one of the Mirror's newsletters The inquest was told that a combination of police investigations and reports, as well as the friends' use of iPhone tracking and bank transaction tracking, led them to an area where he was last believed to have been
His brother, Aniket Tavare said: He was my younger brother
He was a very happy and well-adjusted child
Our dad passed away when he was six years old
He was very sporty and he never let life get in his way
When Covid struck, he stayed with my mum and worked from home
He felt fine for a little bit, but then he started rapidly declining
He was extremely frustrated by this
When I last saw him he was very different - we couldn't really talk about anything as his life was on pause
There were no specific mental health concerns - we knew he was down, but that was more for his circumstances
I thought he would ride it out like every other challenge he faced in life
He will be missed by a lot of people
Concluding the inquest, assistant Hertfordshire coroner Jonathan Stevens said: Abhi Tavare was an extremely talented man
He had been to Oxford University and had excelled
He had a very tight-knit group of friends
He was due to be best man at one of their weddings in the following year
He was an exceptionally talented person
He contracted long Covid and that presented him with a dramatic change to his life
He had seen numerous consultants to no avail
Once he was declared missing, the response from his friends was quite overwhelming
He recorded the death as suicide

Layth Maumoniat had struggled since losing his mum two years ago, and in April the year seven schoolboy was tragically found dead by his older sister after he became emotional A dad has paid emotional tribute to his 12-year-old son who took his own life two years after his mum's suicide
Young Layth Maumoniat, a year even at Allerton High School, was said to have been 'emotional and screaming' before he was found dead by his older sister
Grieving dad Ali Maumoniat told LeedsLive : We've lost him and we feel empty
He was the funniest lad and the personality in our household
He added: He was so emotional and an hour later his sister came running and was screaming and he was found dead
Allah gave me my beautiful boy Layth 12 years ago but sadly I today have to return him back to his Lord where he'll be with the rest of the angels and reunited with his mum
In 2020, at just 10 years old, Layth lost his mum to suicide and often struggled after his mother's death, Ali said
I just cannot imagine what was going through his head at that moment
I think all he was thinking was that he'll be back with his mum, he said
May the angels lift you in their wings and take you to the highest paradise my beautiful little lion
On April 30, days after the schoolboy's death, a balloon release, organised by his friends from school, happened in Alwoodley, Leeds
Hundreds turned out with blue and white balloons as well as a balloon arch in the shape of a cross
Ali and family held a funeral for Laythe on Wednesday (May 4) at Leeds Grand Mosque in Woodsley Road, Hyde Park
His dad said: It was a beautiful turnout
Everyone was there from kids to parents and non-Muslim and Muslim families
Everyone was very respectful at the Grand Mosque where the prayers were given to Layth
The news also brought sadness to hundreds of people across Leeds
Many shared their condolences across social media, sending well wishes to Layth's family
Mandy Grainger said: Absolutely heartbreaking
Thoughts are with your family
Jacqueline Stott added: Aww so sad RIP
Love to his family and friends
Claire Crann added: My heart breaks for him and his family
I have a son the same age and I just cannot imagine losing him
Dipak Parmar said: RIP little prince
May you find salvation and eternal happiness in the kingdom of God where you are forever safe.  Rest little one
Barbara Paley shared her condolences and said: This is very sad, why does it keep happening, and Lora Benson added: This is so sad
A Leeds City Council spokesperson added: The death of Layth Maumoniat is extremely sad and we offer our sincere condolences to his family, friends and everyone else who knew him
We are working closely with the school to ensure staff and pupils are supported through this difficult time
A spokesperson for Allerton High School confirmed they were told the pupil had died, but haven't heard anything else since then
They issued a brief statement on behalf of the school and said: All we can confirm at the moment is that a young student, a year seven student, has died

A heartbroken family have paid tribute to a 'strong' mother who was tragically found dead by her partner as he returned home from taking their daughter out for food A devastated family have paid tribute to a 'strong' mum who left them shocked after she sadly took her own life
Coroners heard this week how Indre Razutyte, 31, was discovered at her Pontefract home by partner Nathan Price along with police after he returned with their young daughter from a meal
The mother and transport manager was declared dead at the scene by paramedics shortly after, reports YorkshireLive
Her death on March 22 was ruled as a suicide at Wakefield Coroner's Court on Tuesday (July 26)
A statement from Nathan to the coroner confirmed that he and Lithuania-born Indre had split up in the days before the tragic incident, and had since begun discussing how to co-parent their daughter
He recalled having been to Indra's house earlier on the day to take the child out for food, but had received no reply when he texted her on the way back
Discovering the house empty with the lights off upon reaching the house, he took his daughter inside through an unlocked conservatory at the back before noticing written notes on the kitchen worktop
I saw notes on the kitchen counter when I walked in
I was concerned on reading them - I was worried and called the police, he said
Police officers arrived at 7
02pm and the three searched for Indre
PC Barraclough was the first to spot her through the glass doors that led to the garage and an ambulance was called
Nathan and PC Barraclough managed to break the window that led to the garage, where they found Indre
CPR was attempted but paramedics tragically pronounced her dead at 7. 33pm
Indre's mother said a written statement read by Assistant Coroner John Hobson that Indra's death had come as a complete shock, with her strong daughter having made plans to return planning to visit her back home in Lithuania only days before
Recalling their text conversations in the days before her passing, she said: The conversations were quite normal with nothing that caused any worries
It's very difficult for me to believe and understand
Indre was a very strong person and never displayed any signs that would have caused her to take her own life
I last visited her and Nathan in October 2021 - they both did appear different and like they may go their separate ways
I believed they were trying to reconcile
Mr Hobson concluded he was satisfied that Indre's cause of death was suicide
Addressing her mother, he said: I offer my condolences to you and thank you for your endeavours in coming to the country to be here for your daughter today
My condolences to Indre's daughter as well and also to Mr Price

02pm and the three searched for Indre
PC Barraclough was the first to spot her through the glass doors that led to the garage and an ambulance was called
Nathan and PC Barraclough managed to break the window that led to the garage, where they found Indre
CPR was attempted but paramedics tragically pronounced her dead at 7. 33pm
Indre's mother said a written statement read by Assistant Coroner John Hobson that Indra's death had come as a complete shock, with her strong daughter having made plans to return planning to visit her back home in Lithuania only days before
Recalling their text conversations in the days before her passing, she said: The conversations were quite normal with nothing that caused any worries
It's very difficult for me to believe and understand
Indre was a very strong person and never displayed any signs that would have caused her to take her own life
I last visited her and Nathan in October 2021 - they both did appear different and like they may go their separate ways
I believed they were trying to reconcile
Mr Hobson concluded he was satisfied that Indre's cause of death was suicide
Addressing her mother, he said: I offer my condolences to you and thank you for your endeavours in coming to the country to be here for your daughter today
My condolences to Indre's daughter as well and also to Mr Price

Robert Needham, 42, killed his wife Kelly Fitzgibbons, 40, and his two daughters, Ava, four, Lexi, two, and their dog at their £600,000 home before taking his own life in March 2020 A distraught uncle has described his moment of terror when he found his niece and her daughters slaughtered by her husband
Robert Needham, 42, killed his wife Kelly Fitzgibbons, 40, and his two daughters, Ava, four, Lexi, two, and their dog at their £600,000 home before taking his own life
The tragedy happened in the quiet village of Woodmancote in West Sussex just a week into lockdown in March 2020
Kelly’s uncle, Ronald Peacock, told an inquest in Horsham, West Sussex, on Tuesday about the moment he found their bodies after climbing through an open window into the couple's bedroom
Mr Peacock added: I realised I could see Ava’s head on the bed, under the duvet
Both girls laying side by side in the bed
I could see Kelly on the floor, near the door
Rob was on the floor in the hallway
I climbed through the window
The TV was on and I could see blood on the pillows
I could tell they were both dead.  Kelly was dead
It was obvious from the position and the amount of blood there was nothing I could do for her
He also said he found Needham lying in the hallway with the shotgun pointed at his head.  He then called 999
The Sun reports he said: I could feel the cold on the back of my head
Kelly was cold, Ava was cold and Lexi too was cold
The inquest was also told Needham was a secret cocaine user and, in the days leading up to the tragedy, had tried to get hold of the drug from a supplier without success
The inquest heard toxicology tests also showed he had not taken any cocaine at the time of the tragedy, but a hair sample test showed he had been a cocaine user
It was also said that in the past he had been forced to see a doctor over the damage the drug had caused to his nose
It was also said Needham had been suffering financial problems in the run-up to the Covid lockdown in March 2020
The family had earlier moved into his family home to help care for his mother, Maureen, 77, after his father Rex, who suffered from Parkinson's disease, died in 2017
They lived upstairs rent-free while his mother lived in a granny flat downstairs
He was building an extension to the house but the family had run into financial problems and had stopped contributing to the bills
The builder had also been forced to take out a loan of £20,000 from his mother to cover his family's day-to-day living
When Covid struck, Needham found it difficult getting hold of building supplies and had to put the work extension on hold, it was said
In a statement to the hearing, Kelly's twin sister, Emma Ambler, said she did not believe the couple had any serious money worries
The inquest heard how Needham had a history of mental illness and an official caution for theft but omitted it when applying for a firearms licence in 2016
He was issued with a firearms licence despite admitting the lies to a police officer, a coroner was told
He then used the certificate to buy a semi-automatic shotgun shortly before killing his family
Needham declared on the application he had never had a criminal conviction and had no history of mental health problems
However, he had previously suffered at least two bouts of mental health problems in 2003 and 2013 and had been treated for depression, it was said
He had also previously been issued with a caution from police for stealing a bicycle going back many years
At the time of his application, a firearms enquiry officer from Hampshire Police questioned Needham at this home, the inquest heard
When Needham was told his GP would be contacted in relation to the application he then told the cop about his mental health problems and admitted having a criminal conviction
The hearing was told he told the officer he did not think they were relevant because they were a long time ago
Chief Inspector Nigel Lecointe of Hampshire said he would have expected greater scrutiny of the application
He said the omissions should have been a cause for concern and raised a red flag
Guidance for firearms licensing in 2016 stated: Whether the applicant is found to have made a false statement is of particular relevance
Deliberate failure to declare relevant convictions, medical conditions or medical history tends to show unfitness regardless of whether the certificate would have been refused if the appropriate declaration had been made
The firearms licence was approved by Sussex Police after Needham and the family moved to the county
The hearing was told Hampshire Police was minded to grant the firearms certificate but Mr Needham moved home and the decision to grant final approval was transferred to the Sussex force
Firearms licences are valid for five years
Mr Lecointe told the court: We should never be complacent about what we do
Our job is to try and do the right thing but we will make judgements with the best intentions
We won’t always get it right but we will try.  The inquest continues

Last Thursday, five family members jumped one-by-one of a seventh-floor apartment in Montreux, Switzerland
Police said the family had become steeped in conspiracy and survivalist theories and withdrawn from society Four members of the same family killed themselves in a suspected collective suicide leap from their seventh-floor apartment
A French family jumped one after another from their apartment in the Swiss town of Montreux, local police investigating the tragic mystery said today
They added that the family appeared to be fervent conspiracy theorists, hoarding food in their apartment
Only a 15-year-old boy survived the tragedy that happened last Thursday in the town on Lake Geneva, and he now remains in a coma in a stable condition in hospital
The Vaud regional police announced that their findings make it possible to rule out the intervention of a third party and suggest that all the victims jumped from the balcony one after the other
They are currently working on the theory of a collective suicide, they said
A 40-year-old man, his 41-year-old wife, her twin sister and the couple’s eight-year-old daughter along with the boy, all took the 20 metre jump from their apartment
France's Journal du Dimanche newspaper said the father, Eric David, grew up in a wealthy part of Marseille and even attended one of France’s most prestigious schools, the Ecole Polytechnique
The twin sisters, Nasrine and Narjisse Feraoun, grew up in a family of five children who were all educated at the elite Lycee Henri-IV in Paris
The mother was a dentist and her sister an ophthalmologist and the newspaper also said the twins were granddaughters of Algerian novelist Mouloud Feraoun
Police said that the family were withdrawn from society before their suicide
Two officers knocked on the apartment door at 6:15am local time, asking to speak to the dad about his son’s homeschool arrangement
However, after a voice asked who was at the door, they said nothing more and officers, unable to enter the apartment, left
Then, less than an hour later, just before 7am, all five leapt from the balcony within the space of five minutes
Police could find no evidence of a struggle, seemingly confirming that all of them jumped of their own accord
A step-ladder was also found on the balcony, where they jumped from
Police said: Before or during the events, no witnesses, including the two police officers present on the spot from 6:15 am and the passers-by at the foot of the building, heard the slightest noise or cry coming from the apartment or the balcony
Technical investigations show no warning signs of such an act
They added that since the start of the pandemic, the family had become increasingly interested in conspiracy and survivalist theories
The family lived in almost complete self-sufficiency, cutting off the outside world
They have amassed a stockpile of food, which took up most of their living space
Only the mother’s twin sister worked outside the home, with neither the mum nor eight-year-old registered with local authorities
Police added that the evidence suggested the family feared authorities interfering with their lives

There was no note or any evidence to suggest army gunner Sophie Madden, 23, had planned to take her own life but coroner Katrina Hepburn returned a verdict of suicide There was no indication that a mum who was found hanged in an army shower block had planned to take her own life, an inquest has heard
Army gunner Sophie Madden, 23, originally from Wigan in Lancashire, was found dead in the shower block of the Saint Martin's Plain Army Training Centre in Folkestone, Kent
The mum-of-one had been on a night out with friends and colleagues the evening before her death, visiting a number of Folkestone pubs and playing pool in the barracks’ bar before heading to bed at around 1am on June 10
Sophie, a gunner in the British Army’s third Regiment Royal Horse Artillery, was seen heading towards the shower block shortly after, but this was considered normal as she often showered before bed
The next morning at around 9
30am a colleague went to the shower block and saw Ms Madden's belongings on a bench outside her preferred cubicle
She looked under the door and saw Ms Madden's legs, which raised the alarm, and once the cubicle door was opened it was found Ms Madden had hanged herself, the inquest in Maidstone heard on Monday
A report by Detective Sergeant Andrew West of Kent Police of the police investigation into Sophie’s death found no signs of third party involvement or criminal activity
The inquest heard there is no evidence she was expecting anyone to come in to the shower block and did not tell anyone she was feeling in any way suicidal, or made anyone aware of any issues when she went in
A toxicology report found she had 173mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood in her system, more than double the drink-drive limit, but friends who went out with her the night before said she had drunk less than she usually would
Ms Madden had no ongoing physical health issues, according to her GP, and she was not known to local mental health services
She had been placed on a vulnerability register by the Army in 2020 after she was seen hitting her head against a wall after drinking alcohol, but after two years of observation and weekly check-ups she was removed from the list in 2022
Colleagues said there were rumours Ms Madden had self-harmed and had a difficult upbringing, and in 2020 she was the victim of an alleged assault by the father of her son Jayden - however she declined to support a prosecution

One of Ms Madden's four sisters, Chantelle, spoke to her just hours before she took her own life and in her police statement said the news of Sophie's death was a total surprise and that Ms Madden was so well loved
She said Ms Madden had claimed she was stressed that her phone was broken and she did not have the money to fix it, and also that she was facing a bill for damages caused by her pet dog at her previous Army accommodation
In a statement, her sister said: Sophie was a strong, independent woman, and didn't tend to worry about things
I told her I'd send her some money and a spare phone the next day, but I didn't have any concerns for her safety or mental health
There was no note or any evidence to suggest premeditation, but coroner Katrina Hepburn returned a verdict of suicide at the inquest held in County Hall, Maidstone on Monday
The coroner explained: I'm satisfied it was Sophie who did the act . .
and there is no evidence of anyone else being involved
I have to consider whether Sophie intended to take her own life or if it was a cry for help
There is no evidence she was expecting anyone to come in and didn't tell anyone she was feeling in any way suicidal, or made anyone aware of any issues when she went in
I am satisfied she did in fact intend to take her own life, and satisfied all other scenarios have been ruled out
Therefore a conclusion of suicide is needed on the balance of probability

Local police in France have said that John Boyes, 63, hit his wife with a baseball bat before strangling her, then he hung himself but his family dispute the prosecutors account of events A British family has disputed the account of French police saying that a husband beat his wife with a baseball bat and strangled her before hanging himself
John Boyes and his wife Kathryn were discovered dead at their home in the Pyrenees
Local French police said that the 63-year-old British marathon champion beat his wife to a grisly death with a baseball bat before he took his own life
Officers claimed their idyllic life in France, where they ran a retreat while 65-year-old Kathryn worked as an artist, was a front for deeper issues
They said the couple, originally from Bournemouth, was experiencing financial difficulties because of a suicide note written on a computer
The couple had been dead for some time when police found them
But John’s brother, Robert, dismissed the murder-suicide theory
He said he spoke to his brother every Sunday and that he had never mentioned any issues with his marriage or money
Talking to The Times, he said: When I first heard they had died I assumed they were victims of a robbery because their house is in a remote area
I want the police to carry out a full investigation and not assume John killed Kath
John was a well-known long distance runner in the 1980s and combined a career in the Royal Mail with his athletics where he won marathons across the world
Him and Kathryn, who worked at Barclays bank in Southampton, met during a running camp in Lanzarote and the pair moved to France in 2004
They ran a specialised retreat for runners and cyclists and had guests included Steve Wray, the British 100km record-holder, and Chris Boardman, the Olympic gold-medal winning cyclist
Robert said that two years ago the couple found maintaining the five acre property too difficult so decided to retire
They sold up and retired to a smaller property nearby in Boudrac
Robert said that they both had their work pensions and were not far off claiming their state pensions as well
He added he couldn’t imagine his brother murdering his sister-in-law and said they had had a wonderful life in France
He also dismissed reports they had run out of money converting the house into holiday accommodation
After two weeks of not hearing anything from his brother, Robert became concerned and a friend, who was due to go cycling with John, discovered their bodies last Sunday
John’s Stava account showed that as recently as April 12 he completed a 3. 6mile run
The local prosecutor Christophe Amunzateguy said the John had hit his wife with a baseball bat before he strangled her
He then went into an annexe and hung himself, they said

On October 27, 2021, George was working at a property on Old Road in Cheadle adjacent to the railway lines
The apprentice builder was said to be visibly upset before taking a break - a short time later he stepped in front of a train A 'beautiful' teenager told his friends thank you for being the top lads you are in a final voice message moments before he took his own life, an inquest heard
George Thompson, 18, had been battling mental health problems and lows he described as ‘thunderstorms’ before his death
His dad, Dave Thompson, described George's death as the ‘hardest thunderstorm yet’
On October 27, 2021, George was working at a property on in Cheadle
The apprentice builder was said to be visibly upset before taking a break - a short time later he was hit by a train
He answered a call from his friend, Alex Mills, who urged him to step away and tried to tell him how much he had going for him
Unfortunately, George did not respond to these pleas
He was a wonderful young lad, his father told an inquest at the Coroner’s Court in Stockport
He was so caring and would do anything for anyone
He really loved helping people and he got a lot from that
He was everything you would want as a parent
He loved us and we loved him.  He was just everything
He was funny, so funny
At the drop of a hat he could just have us laughing
George was the most beautiful, caring, intelligent, reliable, funny, loyal, handsome, courteous, polite, son and brother a parent could ever wish for
There was so much to come but we shall have to treasure the memories we have.  But they’re not enough.  We wanted more
Mr Thompson explained that George's good moments far outweighed the bad, reports the Manchester Evening News
The lifelong Stockport County fan had often struggled with his mental health and previously tried to take his own life on September 15 but had misjudged when it was coming and was taken into hospital
He told the mental health team at Stepping Hill Hospital he was ‘gutted’ by what had happened
During the inquest, Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust were subjected to criticism from George's family, who could not believe the teen was assessed as low risk by the mental health team despite being considered a higher risk just three hours prior
The GP was shocked when I told him George was allowed home, Dave Thompson said
I can’t get away from the fact that three hours before he was classed as high risk but when he was in the room with Ms Dunne (conducting the mental health assessment) he was deemed low risk
There was almost no common sense thinking allowed and they have to stick to this criteria.  Everything seems so rigid
On a number of occasions throughout the inquest, Mr Thompson and his son Will both stated something needs to change
After George's death the trust conducted an investigation, which they say is a standard procedure when someone known to mental health services dies
No actions were put in place by Pennine Care as a result of the report but the trust says they listened to the family's concerns and staff have taken them on board
According to his therapist Mike Andrews, George was making progress in his battle with the ‘thunderclouds’ in his mind and was really engaged with his sessions as well as those he had with Karen Taylor of Healthy Minds
Both clinical professionals spoke highly of George and his determination to heal himself, but these ‘thunderclouds got the better of him in the end’, Mr Andrews said
After coming to a conclusion of suicide, assistant coroner Anna Morris said: It is hard not to have been moved by how much he was loved by all who knew him
George’s mum Caroline, dad David, and brother Will thanked all those who have supported them through this time including Stockport County football club, those assisting the coronal investigation and everyone who has shared wonderful stories of George

Get email updates with the day's biggest stories On October 27, 2021, George was working at a property on Old Road in Cheadle adjacent to the railway lines
The apprentice builder was said to be visibly upset before taking a break - a short time later he stepped in front of a train A 'beautiful' teenager told his friends thank you for being the top lads you are in a final voice message moments before he took his own life, an inquest heard
George Thompson, 18, had been battling mental health problems and lows he described as ‘thunderstorms’ before his death
His dad, Dave Thompson, described George's death as the ‘hardest thunderstorm yet’
On October 27, 2021, George was working at a property on in Cheadle
The apprentice builder was said to be visibly upset before taking a break - a short time later he was hit by a train
He answered a call from his friend, Alex Mills, who urged him to step away and tried to tell him how much he had going for him
Unfortunately, George did not respond to these pleas
He was a wonderful young lad, his father told an inquest at the Coroner’s Court in Stockport
He was so caring and would do anything for anyone
He really loved helping people and he got a lot from that
He was everything you would want as a parent
He loved us and we loved him.  He was just everything
He was funny, so funny
At the drop of a hat he could just have us laughing
George was the most beautiful, caring, intelligent, reliable, funny, loyal, handsome, courteous, polite, son and brother a parent could ever wish for
There was so much to come but we shall have to treasure the memories we have.  But they’re not enough.  We wanted more
Mr Thompson explained that George's good moments far outweighed the bad, reports the Manchester Evening News
The lifelong Stockport County fan had often struggled with his mental health and previously tried to take his own life on September 15 but had misjudged when it was coming and was taken into hospital
He told the mental health team at Stepping Hill Hospital he was ‘gutted’ by what had happened
During the inquest, Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust were subjected to criticism from George's family, who could not believe the teen was assessed as low risk by the mental health team despite being considered a higher risk just three hours prior

Sergey Protosenya, 55, is suspected of killing his wife Natalya and his daughter, 18, at their villa in Spain but his son Fedor insists his dad is not a killer A Russian millionaire accused of killing his wife, daughter and himself was actually murdered, according to his son
Former gas tycoon Sergey Protosenya, 55, allegedly beat his wife Natalya, 53, and 18-year-old daughter Maria to death with an axe at their luxury Spanish villa before killing himself
It is one of four recent 'suicides' of Russian gas business executives who are believed to be linked to Vladimir Putin's circle, with their deaths widely considered 'suspicious'
Catalan police are still treating the deaths as a double murder-suicide
But Mr Protosenya's son Fedor spoke out on Tuesday insisting that his dad was not a killer and could never harm his family
His comments come amid speculation that the crime could be a triple mafia murder disguised as domestic violence
The 22-year-old university student spoke after arriving at the Costa Brava resort of Lloret de Mar where his relatives were found dead at their holiday home on April 19
My father is not a killer
He loved my mother and especially Maria my sister, Fedor told Mail Online.  She was his princess
He could never do anything to harm them
I don’t know what happened that night but I know that my dad did not hurt them
Josep Milan, the head of the regional Mossos d’Esquadra police force for the province of Girona, which includes Lloret de Mar, gave a recent update on the case
Speaking ahead of Fedor’s comments, he said: Investigators are focusing on a person who has committed suicide and two other people found dead inside a property and that is what we’re looking at
Everything points to it being a domestic violence crime, a double murder and subsequent homicide
The police chief described reports pointing to the possible involvement of the Russian mafia in the crime as speculative
A Mossos source insisted nothing has changed since Mr Milan spoke last week
They added: This is still being treated as a double murder and subsequent suicide
Fedor had stayed behind at the family home in the French city of Bordeaux while his relatives travelled to Lloret de Mar to spend their Easter holiday at their Catalan villa
He raised the alarm through a friend of his father’s last Tuesday morning after his phone calls to the house went unanswered
The friend alerted police who found Mr Protosenya hanging lifeless from a noose tied to a garden railing and the bodies of his wife Natalya, 53, and their 18-year-old daughter Maria inside
Police have been working on the theory Mr Protosenya, who had been deputy chairman of major Russian gas firm Novotek, attacked his daughter with an axe and knife while she slept before murdering his wife in the same way and then taking his own life
Local reports in the aftermath of the gruesome discovery said Fedor was quick to raise the alarm when he could not reach his family by phone because he had been left disturbed by the last phone conversation he had with them last Monday evening
The Spanish Government Delegation for Gender Violence has already registered Sergey’s wife as the 12th person so far this year in Spain killed by her partner or former partner - and the 1,138th since records began in 2003
Spain’s Equality Minister, without waiting for the court investigation into the crime to be concluded, left little doubt she believed Mr Protosenya was to blame in her condemnation of the murders last week by describing them as gender-related killings in a press address
The results of the autopsies have not been made public as is normal in Spain, although the information being released on the ongoing probe into the crimes has been limited by a secrecy order placed over it by the investigating judge

Damilya Jussipaliyeva's boyfriend sent the revenge porn to a friend and threatened to show it to her family - coroner's court heard she was in a 'disturbed state' before taking her own life A business student whose boyfriend shared a revenge porn film of her with a friend took her own life in a disturbed state, a coroner has found
Damilya Jussipaliyeva, 21, plunged 80ft to her death a week after Alessio Bianchi sent the video of her performing a sex act on him in a phone booth to a friend
Alessio, 30, was so angered by her spreading rumours about him he had threatened to show her family the clip and said he would also send them footage of her taking cocaine
Damilya left a suicide note which read: Alessio I love you, sorry
Another said: Mommy and Daddy I'm sorry
Hours before her death, Damilya and Alessio had fought outside his flat and he pushed her into a fountain, Inner West London Coroner's Court heard
Recording a narrative verdict, assistant coroner Bernard Richmond said: This is a tragic case
Her mind was plainly disturbed and in that state she formed an intention to kill herself
Electronic devices showed she had been searching for methods of suicides, terraces and heights, the inquest heard
There had been a rapid deterioration in her mental health in the last few days, the coroner said
She was in a very disturbed state immediately prior to her death
The coroner confirmed Damilya's injuries were consistent with a fall from a great height
He said there were no injuries, indicative of assault or restraint by a third party
The coroner said Damilya had suffered stress, depression and anxiety due to a number if factors, including her relationship with her family, her own drug and alcohol use, difficulties in coping with her degree course and her relationship with her boyfriend
The coroner described how Damilya had tried to take her own life twice before and was stopped from doing so
She said that by June 1, 2017 the student's mental state had significantly deteriorated
Shortly before she died at 1
20am, Damilya's mind was plainly disturbed and in that state she formed that intention to kill herself evidenced by goodbye notes to her parents and partner
Alessio, who was born in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia and Damilya, who was from Kazakhstan, had been in an on-off relationship for two-and-a-half years
They met at Regent's University in 2017 where they were both studying business
Alessio said: She was a sweet girl.  We had similar personalities.  We had similar backgrounds
The couple's friends were aware of their tumultuous relationship and Alessio had reported her to police himself on several occasions, when she had scratched him and she had attempted suicide
He told the inquest he had prevented a suicide attempt by Ms in September 2016
The court heard they were both using drugs, including cocaine, cannabis and ketamine, as well as alcohol
She was sent a video recording on WhatsApp of her in the phone booth in north London, on May 25, 2017
Attached was a message saying: I am going to keep destroying you
One of her friends received the same clip from three different numbers, with one containing the threat: I will f**k you up next, my love
Alessio claimed she had been spreading rumours about him and he sent the sex video to make her stop

Billie Charity hit rock-bottom following the tragic death of her brother Stan
Here, the 47-year-old explains how focusing on her passion for photography helped her grieve and build a new life My most precious memories of my younger brother Stan are of us as kids
He was happy, beautiful and the sweetest boy in the world.  I adored him
We’d spend hours playing Lego and Monopoly together, and remained close into adulthood
I hold these memories close now – the boy he was and the relationship we had before his mental illness took hold in his thirties
Our parents separated when we were little
My dad would travel to an off-grid cottage in a remote valley near our home in Herefordshire to spend time with us
He was a fashion photographer and I still treasure the pictures he took of those sunny days
My mum also took wonderful photos of us, capturing family Christmases and our amazing garden, which she filled with sunflowers one year
Photography was a huge passion for the whole family
When Stan and I grew up, we lived together in London
I loved working at the BBC Learning department doing PR
But Stan never seemed happy and he returned to Herefordshire to live with Mum
I took photos all the time and my now-husband Dave and I would always take our cameras out at weekends
After a few visits back to Herefordshire, Dave fell in love with the area
He got on really well with Stan, which made me happy
I was feeling broody and the countryside felt like a better option, so we moved back and lived with Mum and my brother for a couple of years
I remember that time fondly
We ate together every night and took turns to cook
We played board games and pool, watched family TV favourites
Most importantly, we talked and reminisced
Some time later, unbeknown to any of us, my brother developed a serious mental illness
I’d had my first daughter and was suffering postnatal depression
Mum was also diagnosed with MS – things were pretty heavy
Me and Stan grew apart
I had another daughter shortly afterwards
I know Stan loved them both but I couldn’t understand why he appeared to have little interest in them and I resented this
He once told them they could have his old car as a play den
He once played pool with them, once bounced on the trampoline with them, once invited them to watch Scooby-Doo
But these gestures were few and far between
It became normal that Stan wasn’t very present in our lives
He never opened up to me about his mental illness and his unbearable suffering
Instead, it came out as anger and him not being very nice
Seeing him became deeply upsetting
I desperately missed my brother, my best friend, my confidant
Then, on Easter Sunday 2016, after several years of barely any communication, Stan turned up at my front door.  I was thrilled
We went for a walk but it soon became obvious something was really wrong
He was finally opening up but he was incredibly paranoid
I was happy that he was talking to me again – I was getting my brother back – but I was worried about him
He said he was very anxious and low, and felt something really bad was going to happen but he didn’t know what
I urged him to see a doctor but he convinced me everything was OK
The next weekend, there was a knock on the door in the middle of the night.  It was the police
Stan’s body had been found
He’d taken his life in the cottage where my dad used to take us as children
What happened next is a total blur
The type of grief that comes from sibling suicide is incredibly complex, especially when you’d been as close as Stan and I were
It’s like something outside of you that you have no control of
It hits you over and over, like a tidal wave
Eventually, I found others online who helped me understand what I was going through
Soon after Stan died, Dave and I moved with our daughters (then aged six and nine) back into Mum’s house
Initially, it was hard because there were signs of Stan everywhere
Each anniversary without him – every birthday, Christmas and Easter – brought further tidal waves of grief and I’d spend days in bed
Then, I rediscovered my camera
I had a strong urge to get far away from Herefordshire and took my eldest daughter to Hong Kong to stay with a cousin
I found solace taking photos of the amazing people and places we saw
Back home, photography became one of the ways I learned to live with my grief
A psychotherapist saw the link between my photography and my recovery
I looked up to Stan as a talented photographer – one of our last conversations was about photography
Two days before he died, he said he was happy and proud that I was pursuing my passion – and gave me his camera
Looking back, he obviously knew he wouldn’t be around for much longer.  He was saying goodbye
Six years after Stan’s death, I’m learning to live with the pain
But out of nowhere I can still get a sudden, sharp stabbing in the stomach that’s so powerful I can’t breathe
My physically healthy, handsome, intelligent, sweet, loved and loving brother is dead
And he died by his own hand
Did he realise that he’d never get to drive his beloved Alfa Romeo again, or play pool, or walk up his favourite mountain, or eat bacon sandwiches, sit in the sunshine? I’ll never see him again or hear his voice
Nor will I ever hug him and tell him he was one of the most significant and loved people in my life
Over the years, different emotions have crashed in and out; anger, guilt, hurt, sadness, confusion.  It’s overwhelming
But when Stan died, I suddenly saw life as extremely precious and short
I became fearless and threw myself into my photography
I’m now working full-time as a freelance photographer, have co-run a gallery and published three books
I’m living life for myself – but also for Stan
He’s always, always with me

Popular and well-respected travel manager, Jennifer Joynt, 36, was found dead in her home after the love of a 'toxic partner' who allegedly faked his cancer consumed her A famous businesswoman was found dead after her whole life turned upside down and 'messed up' by a man who allegedly faked having stage four cancer in a bid to control her
Jennifer Joynt, 36, a supply chain manager, was tragically found dead in her bed by her dad, after he forced his way into her home in Manchester on February 26, report Manchester Evening News
Her family became concerned about her after they hadn't heard from her in days
An inquest into her death, held at South Manchester Coroner’s Court, heard the woman - who was born in Stockport - had experienced problems with her mental health in the past
The court heard that family and friends supported her during these difficult periods of her life
The inquest also outlined that while there were signs Ms Joynt was considering suicide, she did not appear to have taken her own life
Notes addressed to her family and friends in notebooks were found by police, scattered around her room
There were also notes on her phone, as well as video messages recorded for her loved ones, in the months before her death
Police found that while some of these notes had been edited on her mobile, there was nothing to indicate they were true indications that she intended to take her own life
Similar notes had also been written on other occasions, which had not led to her attempting to take her own life
There was evidence that Ms Joynt had attempted to purchase a particular drug, which has appeared in several other suicide inquests recently
While police were able to establish that most of the companies the 36-year-old reached out to had declined the sale
There was one purchase attempt that had not been declined, but officers were unable to establish whether the sale had gone through and whether the substance was delivered
Police said they could not find any evidence of packaging or a container for this substance in the home, although when Miss Joynt’s phone was unlocked by officers, they discovered that she had been visiting a site instructing her on what medications to take alongside this substance to take her own life
Traces of these drugs were found within her system
Professor Hunt, the pathologist who performed the post mortem examination of Miss Joynt, gave her cause of death as aspiration of gastric contents
This means that food or fluid she had consumed had caused a blockage in her windpipe or lungs
Toxicology results showed a range of non-lethal levels of various drugs in her system, but these were not highlighted as contributing factors to Miss Joynt’s death
Ms Joynt's mum, Margaret, told the court about her bubbly and strong daughter who embraced life and loved fitness and travelling
However, she also said an extremely toxic relationship in the months before her daughter's death consumed her, with the young woman unable to let go of her partner who allegedly faked having stage four cancer in a bid to control her
After a tough few months of set-backs, things started to look up for Miss Joynt, with the young woman in the process of buying a new house, set to start a new job just weeks after her death, and even taking trips away with friends and making plans to spend time with those around her
Her dad told the court his daughter spoke to people that were struggling and actively tried to help them and just seemed to love life so much, leaving her family feeling like she was finally turning a corner and starting to get better after a horrific ordeal
Senior coroner Alison Mutch recorded a narrative conclusion that Miss Joynt died from complications of asphyxia, as it was impossible to tell on the balance of probabilities whether or not the young woman had ingested something in an attempt to take her own life
Addressing Ms Joynt’s family she said: As a family you were devoted to each other and as parents you had supported her
She was obviously very popular and very successful, and was extremely well thought of at work and she had a very bright future ahead of her
She was extremely fortunate to have such a caring family
Ms Joynt’s family established the Jenni Joynt Foundation, which aims to help others who have faced, or are facing similar mental health challenges to which she succumbed
The 39-year-old was a well-known and hugely popular figure across the business travel industry
She had worked as a travel manager at NatWest Group/RBS since 2016, and was best-known as a long-time member of the Institute of Travel Management (ITM) and as an active and passionate member of its Northern Regional Committee
During her spare time, it is reported that she enjoyed a range of fitness activities, including open water swimming
ITM celebrated her life at its annual conference in Birmingham in April, with its CEO, Scott Davies, paying tribute to her
He said: Jenni was an incredibly special, vibrant and energetic member of the ITM community
Her natural desire to make everyone feel welcome and valued set the tone at our events and struck anyone that she met
Jenni’s warmth, humour, empathy and talent were admired by so many of us
Jenni would simply light up a room and any situation you can imagine – a business meeting, an education session, a conference, a gym class, an evening in a bar – was just infinitely better if Jenni was there
We miss her so much already and we will always remember her, and we will look to find positive ways to help those facing struggles any way we can

Get email updates with the day's biggest stories Popular and well-respected travel manager, Jennifer Joynt, 36, was found dead in her home after the love of a 'toxic partner' who allegedly faked his cancer consumed her A famous businesswoman was found dead after her whole life turned upside down and 'messed up' by a man who allegedly faked having stage four cancer in a bid to control her
Jennifer Joynt, 36, a supply chain manager, was tragically found dead in her bed by her dad, after he forced his way into her home in Manchester on February 26, report Manchester Evening News
Her family became concerned about her after they hadn't heard from her in days
An inquest into her death, held at South Manchester Coroner’s Court, heard the woman - who was born in Stockport - had experienced problems with her mental health in the past
The court heard that family and friends supported her during these difficult periods of her life
The inquest also outlined that while there were signs Ms Joynt was considering suicide, she did not appear to have taken her own life
Notes addressed to her family and friends in notebooks were found by police, scattered around her room
There were also notes on her phone, as well as video messages recorded for her loved ones, in the months before her death
Police found that while some of these notes had been edited on her mobile, there was nothing to indicate they were true indications that she intended to take her own life
Similar notes had also been written on other occasions, which had not led to her attempting to take her own life
There was evidence that Ms Joynt had attempted to purchase a particular drug, which has appeared in several other suicide inquests recently
While police were able to establish that most of the companies the 36-year-old reached out to had declined the sale
There was one purchase attempt that had not been declined, but officers were unable to establish whether the sale had gone through and whether the substance was delivered
Police said they could not find any evidence of packaging or a container for this substance in the home, although when Miss Joynt’s phone was unlocked by officers, they discovered that she had been visiting a site instructing her on what medications to take alongside this substance to take her own life
Traces of these drugs were found within her system
Professor Hunt, the pathologist who performed the post mortem examination of Miss Joynt, gave her cause of death as aspiration of gastric contents
This means that food or fluid she had consumed had caused a blockage in her windpipe or lungs
Toxicology results showed a range of non-lethal levels of various drugs in her system, but these were not highlighted as contributing factors to Miss Joynt’s death
Ms Joynt's mum, Margaret, told the court about her bubbly and strong daughter who embraced life and loved fitness and travelling
However, she also said an extremely toxic relationship in the months before her daughter's death consumed her, with the young woman unable to let go of her partner who allegedly faked having stage four cancer in a bid to control her

Rory Wood's family said he lost his battle with his brain in a heartbreaking tribute, with the University of Manchester addressing upsetting reports about his death A student has been found dead after posting a series of troubling tweets about being unable to afford university
The family of Rory Wood, from Hereford, say he had lost his battle with his brain and hoped that increased awareness of mental illness would be his legacy
His cause of death has not been announced, but a pal claimed in a viral tweet that Rory had taken his own life because of the hopelessness of his situation
Rory, 27, who was a podcaster, gave the University of Manchester a £1000 deposit for a Masters degree but then was unable to afford living expenses
Police said he was first reported missing just after 2am on Monday having failed to return home from work and he died the following day
One of his final tweets said: I lost one grand in a deposit to a university because, while I met the offer requirements, it became clear that I hadn't made nearly enough money to fund the living costs after two years saving in full time work
There were no university fees in this country until 1998 btw
He added on his @thekafkadude account: Everything just feels impossible and unliveable
Rory's friend Phoca Vitulina alleged the university had rejected his application - but the University of Manchester has denied this
She tweeted: So Manchester University took an applicants £1k, rejected their application because they can’t make living costs, and didn’t give the money back
This applicant, a friend, then dies by suicide because of his absolute hopelessness of his situation.  It’s absolutely scandalous
The University of Manchester said records showed the prospective student's application 'is still open' and was 'not rejected by the University'
They added in a statement that they could not find any record suggesting any request for a refund
Rory's family have since shared their heartbreak over his death in a tribute shared on Twitter
They said: Thank you for all your love for our beautiful son, brother, nephew and cousin, Rory
We are completely humbled and overwhelmed by the messages of support on Twitter
We realise that there are people on here that truly loved him and the fact that he made your days just a little bit brighter brings a smile to our faces in these tragic times
Rory may not have mentioned it on here but he has always had loving and supportive friends and family that tried everything to help him but his battle with his brain sadly overcame him
We ask that Rory's legacy is the increased awareness of mental illness - please all look after yourselves and always remember to speak out
Rory completing his bachelors degree in politics, philosophy and economics last week was one of the proudest moments of our lives
We will never stop loving you Rory x

Gaia Pope-Sutherland's was worried about the imminent release from prison of a man she had accused of raping her and her mental health was suffering, an inquest heard A missing teenager had feared she was pregnant days before her death, an inquest heard today
Gaia Pope-Sutherland, 19, was reported missing from her home in Swanage, Dorset on November 7, 2017
Her body was found 11 days later in the undergrowth
Dorset Coroner's Court heard that Gaia's mental health was suffering due to worries about the imminent release from prison of a man she had accused of raping her
She had also recently split up with her boyfriend and had been sent indecent images on social media, the inquest heard
Gaia, who suffered from severe epilepsy and post-traumatic stress disorder, had been experiencing ongoing manic episodes in the weeks before her disappearance, it was said
Forensic pathologist Dr Russell Delaney told the hearing her naked body was found in deep undergrowth and that she had died from hypothermia
Gaia's clothing was found scattered across a field as if she had been removing it as she walked
Dr Delaney said told the hearing at the time of her disappearance she had recently split from her boyfriend and had become convinced she was pregnant, even though a test was negative
He said there was no medical evidence she was pregnant at the time of her death
Gaia had been due to see the GP for an appointment at 5pm the day she vanished
Dr Delaney said the day she disappeared the teen left her aunt's home at about 3
40pm and went to a friend's where she was behaving irrationally and began undressing
Gaia redressed but left without her coat, and the last known sighting of her was a few minutes later
Dr Delaney said the post-mortem examination found no signs of trauma, but there was evidence of Wischnewski spots in the lining of her stomach - a sign of hypothermia
The pathologist said there were several possibilities why Gaia had undressed before her death
It is possible Gaia was suffering from paradoxical undressing - where she thought she was overheating and removed her clothing
Another possibility could have been her declining mental health
He said: It is possible she was undressed because of her deteriorating mental health and that has made her vulnerable to hypothermia
The deterioration of her mental health has led to her being outside, and cold and wet, and led to her becoming more confused with hypothermia
The undressing is typical of paradoxical undressing and hypothermia
She also had minor cuts to her feet and shins, consistent with walking through gorse and brambles while not wearing shoes or socks
Dr Delaney described a condition called hide and die where someone suffering from hypothermia burrows into a closed space
Gaia, who used cannabis and ecstasy, was prescribed medication to treat up to five seizures a day, but Dr Delaney could not be sure she had suffered one before her death
He said: I am certain that hypothermia has made a significant contribution to her death
It is significant to explain her death alone
It could have acted in concert with epilepsy
In the absence of anyone witnessing the seizure, there isn't a way of determining to a significant degree of certainty that someone has had a seizure immediately prior to death
Dr Delaney said he believed Gaia had died a number of days before her body was found but was unable to say exactly when
He said: I would always urge caution by trying to be too specific and narrow the time frame down too much
Research entomologist Martin Hall has previously told the inquest that having examined blowfly larvae recovered from the teenager's body he believed the latest she was alive was November 9

Paula Halliday, 33, worked as an auxiliary nurse and after a number of failings from health services she took her own life as she struggled with a traumatic event where something happened in London A young mum has tragically taken her own life after a number of failings from medical services as she experienced a traumatic event the year before in London
Paula Halliday had struggled with her mental health and hadn’t seen her two young girls since the incident in October 2021
In the time since, on a number of occasions, she took overdoses and said she wanted to kill herself, Lancs Live reported
The 33-year-old from High Wycombe was being seen by mental health services - but a number of failings meant she didn’t receive the care she should have
When she killed herself, her body was found by her then partner and she had left a number of notes including one that simply read: It’s my time
An inquest into her death at Preston Crown Court heard how the auxiliary nurse began seeing Amy Cooper in September 2021
Speaking to the inquest, Miss Cooper said: I rang the crisis team once when she was texting me at night because she was just beside herself and I didn't know what to do
She was drinking a lot, every day
In October 2021 something happened in London and she was quite traumatised by it
She was seeing someone from the mental health team every week and they would ring her every other day to check in on her but she felt let down by them and said they weren't listening to her
She was always seeing someone different so she kept having to go over what happened every time and she found that really distressing
Samantha Ferguson, a matron at Lancashire Care which is part of Lancashire and South Cumbria NHS Foundation Trust which provides mental health services, admitted there had been several failings in Paula's care
The inquest heard that the team had been unwilling to start any psychiatric treatment or medication until Paula managed to reduce her alcohol intake
The matron said: Handovers weren't always fully completed and risks weren't always discussed.  It was sporadic
Some people had to look through the notes to familiarise themselves with her
She saw a number of different people at her face-to-face appointments which isn't ideal
What we would have liked to have been better was not necessarily more face-to-face appointments but better documented telephone calls and the ability to escalate a higher evidence of risk
And more face-to-face contact would have been expected given the high level of risk
What crimes have been reported in your neighbourhood? Check with In Your Area
The inquest, which was attended by a large number of Paula's friends and relatives, heard that a number of changes have been brought in at the trust
This included plans to increase staffing and issuing stricter guidance when handing over patients during morning meetings
Staff have also been trained on the importance of clinical curiosity, documenting clinical history and risk assessments
Claire Gibson, a consultant nurse at LSCFT, apologised to Paula's family for the failings in her care
She added: I want to apologise because there were some failings and I am really sorry
On the morning of January 13 this year Miss Cooper had driven to Paula's house to pick her up and take her to work
Although Paula hadn't replied to any of her texts this was normal given how heavily Paula had been drinking

Amy then went inside the house in Morecambe where she found Paula dead
Returning a conclusion of suicide Area Coroner Richard Taylor said he was satisfied that Paula had done a deliberate act with the intention of ending her life
Of course she was high risk and her frustrations about not getting the treatment she wanted are understandable, he added
In the notes she left she wasn't rambling
It was thought out and considered
The fact that so many people are here today goes to show how much she is missed and loved
A page on GoFundMe set up after Paula's death raised £730 in her name for the NSPCC
Friends posted their tributes to her in the comments with one describing her as a very special person while another said she was a beautiful lady

Nathan Hunt's dad Derek says new evidence found his son - who served with Prince Harry - was deeply traumatised by a Taliban attack that killed and seriously wounded 10 Afghan soldiers The family of a war hero who served alongside Prince Harry claim new evidence shows that their son’s suicide was linked to combat service
Warrant Officer Nathan Hunt’s parents are campaigning to have his name added to the memorial at the National Arboretum in Staffordshire
So far defence chiefs have refused to budge on their ruling that his death was not linked to his service in Afghanistan 10 years before
Now the family have discovered he was deeply traumatised by a Taliban rocket attack which killed and seriously wounded up to 10 Afghan soldiers
The carnage happened in December 2007 during the ferocious battle for the town of Musa Qala in Helmand
The report states that Nathan and another soldier tried and failed to save the lives of Afghan soldiers
Nathan’s dad Derek, himself an Army veteran, said: I received this report last week and it shows beyond doubt that Nathan was seriously traumatised by the war
He had nightmares and was really struggling
He had to deal with Afghan soldiers who had been blown to pieces or who had lost limbs
Anyone who witnessed that sort of thing would be seriously affected by it
This seems to have been ignored by people who decided that Nathan should not have his name on the war memorial
Or, worse still, they had no idea this happened to Nathan
Nathan was found hanged at his home in Lincoln aged 39 on January 2, 2018, after developing PTSD
He left behind a young daughter
An inquest seven months later heard he had suffered nightmares as a result of dealing with Taliban bombs
A recently acquired transcript reveals that his ex-wife Lainey was convinced he had PTSD after returning from Afghanistan in 2008
But he refused to get help because he was fearful of the impact it might have on his promotion chances
Derek added: I will be taking this up with the new Veterans’ Minister Johnny Mercer when I meet with him next month
There is now so much evidence showing that Nathan was obviously in a bad way after he returned from Afghanistan
I just can’t understand why this has all been ignored
Nathan served with Harry in Helmand in 2008 while attached to the Household Cavalry

The report states that Nathan and another soldier tried and failed to save the lives of Afghan soldiers
Nathan’s dad Derek, himself an Army veteran, said: I received this report last week and it shows beyond doubt that Nathan was seriously traumatised by the war
He had nightmares and was really struggling
He had to deal with Afghan soldiers who had been blown to pieces or who had lost limbs
Anyone who witnessed that sort of thing would be seriously affected by it
This seems to have been ignored by people who decided that Nathan should not have his name on the war memorial
Or, worse still, they had no idea this happened to Nathan
Nathan was found hanged at his home in Lincoln aged 39 on January 2, 2018, after developing PTSD
He left behind a young daughter
An inquest seven months later heard he had suffered nightmares as a result of dealing with Taliban bombs
A recently acquired transcript reveals that his ex-wife Lainey was convinced he had PTSD after returning from Afghanistan in 2008
But he refused to get help because he was fearful of the impact it might have on his promotion chances
Derek added: I will be taking this up with the new Veterans’ Minister Johnny Mercer when I meet with him next month
There is now so much evidence showing that Nathan was obviously in a bad way after he returned from Afghanistan
I just can’t understand why this has all been ignored
Nathan served with Harry in Helmand in 2008 while attached to the Household Cavalry

Mental health campaigner Trevor Coult has shared his devastation at losing Pete Carson who served in the Royal Irish Regiment with Trevor in Afghanistan and was found dead in a suspected suicide A decorated war hero is mourning his 13th ­comrade lost to the armed forces mental health crisis
Campaigner Trevor Coult, who won the Military Cross for service in Iraq, was devastated to learn last week of the latest death
Pete Carson, who served in the Royal Irish Regiment with Trevor in Afghanistan, was found dead in a suspected suicide
Anguished Trevor, 47, said: In any other profession there would be calls for a major inquiry – but it seems the Government doesn’t mind if those who served their country kill themselves
He added: I was absolutely devastated to learn that Pete had died
That’s at least six people from my old regiment who have died and at least 13 people who I knew or served with have now taken their own lives
There have been more deaths
I don’t think there is any job in the country where someone would know so many people who have taken their own lives
The 12 others who Trevor knew include fellow Afghan vet Brett Savage, 32, who had taken part in a documentary in which he said the Ministry of Defence was not doing enough to help
Before he died he spoke about combat in Afghanistan and said: My unit was under fire for 55 days.  It was non-stop
I saw good men killed
We lost four in total
I was blown up with an RPG and lost the hearing in my right ear
I was also shot in the chest, the body armour saved my life.  I went crazy
I was on drugs, drinking all the time
Shortly after Brett’s death, Sgt Fraser Stirling, also a member of the Royal Irish Regiment and a one-time colleague of Trevor’s, took his own life aged 30
The other tragedies include Northern Ireland veteran Deane Hart, 53, and Capt Gary Case, a veteran of Iraq, who died weeks after being awarded an MBE
Capt Case, 50, had gained ­promotion from the ranks and was one of the most popular officers in the Rifles regiment
Another of those who died was Jamie Davis, also a former member of the Rifles
The 30-year-old dad-of-two hanged himself in January 2020
He had previously suffered shrapnel wounds and witnessed the deaths of colleagues in both Iraq and Afghanistan
His widow Alicia said he had nightmares night and day and was ashamed of his condition
She added: He was screaming in the middle of the night
He was riddled with guilt
One of his best mates got killed and he said that should have been him
The other soldiers and veterans in confirmed or suspected suicides are Danny Johnston, 35, Mitchell Matthews, 24, James Ross, 30, Paul Cochrane, 18, Eddie Murphy, 50, Andy McFarland, 32 and Paul Brennan
Dad of one Trevor, from Suffolk, added: The MoD says that the deaths have nothing in common and there isn’t a problem with suicide
All of those who died had mental health issues, they had all seen combat and they all served in the armed forces – that’s what they had in common
Since 2017 at least 350 veterans and service personnel are believed to have taken their own lives
At least 22 have died from suspected suicides so far this year
The vast majority had seen combat
The MoD said: There are many ­varied and complex reasons why ­someone may take their own life and we will continue to do all that we can to provide support and mental health ­provision to those who have ­dedicated their lives to the service of this country
The Sunday People ’s Save Our Soldiers campaign is calling for a radical overhaul of the way top brass treat mental health

Kieran, from Walsall, had increasingly isolated himself following relationship problems according to his sister and moved into shared accommodation rather than ask friends for help A sister whose golden-hearted brother took his own life hopes his death will help other men address their own mental health
Kieran Huntington took his own life last week despite appearing to be in good spirits, according to his older sister Danielle
Danielle says that 25-year-old Kieran had been dealing with ongoing mental health issues following the death of his mum when he was 17
She says Kieran, from Walsall, had increasingly isolated himself following relationship problems and moved into shared accommodation rather than seek help from family and friends
And now Danielle, 29, wants to use her family's tragedy to encourage men who are dealing with difficult circumstances to speak out
Birmingham Live reports that the alarm was raised for Kieran's welfare on Sunday, August 14, after his loved ones became concerned for him
Danielle, originally from Walsall but now living in Stafford, said: The ambulance turned up first, they did try resuscitation, the police and ambulance were in attendance
Instead of asking people for a place to stay, he felt like, as a man, he should have the responsibility for himself and moved into a house share
When he was 17, our mother died
He never sought help to move on from our mum's death
He struggled with it for the last few years
He was always just plodding along and carried on
Danielle hopes the death of her brother will shine a light on mental health and encourage other men who are struggling to seek help
Men should be more open and talk more, express their feelings more and don't keep them bottled up, she said
Whether that is to do with relationship problems, work problems, any problem that they have got, no matter how small or big, just talk about it rather than bottle it up inside
Kieran was a boyhood Liverpool fan and supported Walsall, which was his local team
He also played football and enjoyed fishing
He was a plasterer by trade but also played an active role in the family's dog training business DC K9
Danielle said Kieran was a popular young man with hundreds of friends, adding: I have been speaking to lots of people and they were saying he was laughing and joking all the time, even recently
He had hundreds and hundreds of friends
Paying tribute to her brother, she said: He was all-round nice, sometimes too nice
He would give his last penny to anybody that would need it

Indre Razutyte, from Pontefract, West Yorkshire, who was loved by everyone she met, was found dead in her garage on March 22, Wakefield Coroner's Court was told A mother who was loved by everyone she met took her own life at home, an inquest heard
Indre Razutyte, 31, was found unresponsive in her kitchen by her ex-partner on March 22
CPR was performed at the home in Pontefract, West Yorkshire, but Indre was declared dead
Suicide notes were found in the kitchen, Yorkshire Live reports
Indre leaves behind a two-year-old daughter
Wakefield Coroner's Court heard on Friday that Indre was much loved by her colleagues at small transport firm Centika Logistics
The mother was a transport manager there, and made such an impression on me immediately
Colleague Wayne Kearns, who joined the company in September last year, said: We're a small company, more like a family
Because of that I worked closely with Indre and we became good friends
She was like a little sister to me
She did used to sometimes talk about the issues she was facing, but it was such a shock to hear about her death and so heartbreaking
We'd spoken the day before when she was working from home
That day me and the manager had been messaging her because she hadn't come in
Losing Indre has felt like losing a member of the family
She was one of the nicest and kindest people I have ever met, she would help anybody
She was so nice, and I don't think she realised how lovely a person she was and how loved she was
I think she was worried about being left on her own
Indre's heartbroken family live in Lithuania, and are hoping to repatriate her home for a funeral there
Wayne and some of Indre's other colleagues have set up a GoFundMe page to help them pay for the costs of getting Indre home
As of April 8, the page is at £4,795
Any money left over from the fundraising will be put into a trust fund for Indre's two-year-old daughter
When we had drivers at the company who were having a bad day and would snap at anyone else, Indre was the only one who could calm them down
Customers would ask for her specifically
She could relate to anybody and I don't think she realised how great she was, Wayne added
She was really good at her job and just at talking to people
We always had a laugh in the office together
If she was feeling down I'd go to Morrisons and get us cake
Indre made such a big impact on me straight away
I wish I could've had the time to get to know her even better
The full inquest has been adjourned to a later date
Assistant coroner John Hobson did recount in brief the events that preceded Indre's death being recorded

Chris Lam died on April 7 after suffering from with depression since the Hilllsborough disaster in 1989 and had spent his life campaigning tirelessly for justice A daughter has paid tribute to her best friend dad who died at the age of 52 after suffering depression since surviving the Hilllsborough tragedy
Chris Lam died on April 7 this year having spent his life campaigning tirelessly for justice having survived the 1989 Hilllsborough disaster that claimed the lives of 97 people
His daughter Rebecca said he struggled with the tragedy since then
Rebecca told the Liverpool Echo : He was a Hillsborough survivor, he's struggled a lot since then, and always struggled in April in the lead up to the anniversary
She said: We knew he was struggling but we've all said none of us expected he would have done anything like this
Paying tribute to her dad, Rebecca said he was a well known and genuine man, who was part of Widnes Running Club where he was known by the nickname Mr Widnes
Rebecca added: He was genuine, he was full of life, always willing to give a hand to anybody
He was there for anybody to have a chat
He was like my best friend, we just bounced off each other
We kept each other going, he's always been my rock
He was so well known we couldn't go anywhere without him bumping into somebody that he knew
She has now set up a Gofundme page to raise money for the Hillsborough Survivors Support Alliance, who provided counselling to her dad, and Amparo, a charity that offers support to anyone affected by suicide
On the page she says: Chris was a wonderful man who brought happiness wherever he went
He was warm, kind, generous, funny, a sportsman, a supporter, a friend to many, a loved one and a doting father
He was also a massive Liverpool FC supporter and a Hillsborough survivor
He campaigned tirelessly for justice and felt passionately about the work of the HSA
He very sadly ended his own life in April 2022
Amparo have offered invaluable support to his loved ones during this difficult time
We believe that raising money for these two organisations in his name will help leave a positive legacy

An inquest has heard how Bailey Reay, 13, sent a heartbreaking 'final goodbye' voice-note to his crush, before being found unresponsive at his grandmother's home A 13-year-old schoolboy sent a heartbreaking final 'last goodbye' message to a girl he fancied before his tragic death, an inquest has heard
Bailey Reay, from Sunderland, was found unresponsive at his grandmother's home where he lived on 19 December 2020
Emergency services were immediately called, but he was tragically pronounced dead - leaving his family and friends devastated, report Chronicle Live
An inquest - held at City Hall on Wednesday - heard how Bailey resided with his grandmother
On December 18, he was left in the care of his grandmother's aunt and they spent some time together eating pizza
It was also heard how Bailey also spent some time in his room playing on his PlayStation
But, by midday on December 19, Bailey was found unresponsive and the emergency services were called but he tragically passed away
The teenager was found in his room with an empty bottle of medication that was originally prescribed to his grandmother
A post-mortem was carried out and toxicology was taken and it was found that Bailey had alcohol and medication, which was eight times a large therapeutic dose, in his system
The pathologist found that Bailey died as a result of the effects of the medication and alcohol which it was heard can impact the central nervous system
The inquest heard there were a number of things that caused Bailey concern including difficult family dynamics and school though recent records suggested he had got back into school and that it seemed to be going well
Following Bailey's death, some concerns were raised over the issue of bullying and police seized his computer and mobile phone which was protected by a pin
However, the inquest heard that nothing specific was identified
However, they did find a voicemail that Bailey had left a girl who he had a crush on which said: I have had a crush on you for the longest time so I guess this is goodbye
Assistant coroner, Karin Welsh, said Bailey had admitted taking medication in the voicemail he left to his crush and recorded a verdict of suicide
She told his family: Why doesn't fall within the remit of an inquest
There were a number of factors in Bailey's life that must have been causing him concern

Named by grieving friends and family as Kiena Dawes, from Fleetwood, Lancashire, she was killed on the Preston to Lancaster line on Friday afternoon
The 23-year-old hairdresser was pronounced dead at the scene in Garstang by paramedics, reports LancsLive
Her brother Kynan Dawes said she was in such a bad place in her head and took the decision to end what was an awful battle in her life
Kiena leaves her daughter Marnie Blu Dawes and Kynan has pledged to give up his job as a builder to take care of her
A GoFundMe page has been set up by Matthew Sanderson to support Kynan and Marnie and pay towards Kiena's funeral costs
It has already raised more than £8,500 against its £2,500 goal
Writing on the GoFundMe page, Matthew said: This is Marnie and her mummy, Marnie is only 9 months old and recently lost her mummy to a tragic suicide
Marnie is now being cared for by her uncle Kynan
Kynan has promised to be there for Marnie through thick and thin as he struggles to deal with the loss of his sister in such tragic circumstances
Kynan has also had to give up his employment as a builder to take care of Marnie which has already had a significant impact on Kynan’s finances
We are asking people not to let Kynan struggle alone
Please support Kynan so he can get a deposit to rent a house, buy some essentials for Marnie and pay towards his sisters funeral
Any excess funds will be placed in trust for Marnie once she turns 18
Thanks again and thanks for your support
It’s ok not to be ok! Please talk to someone and don’t suffer in silence
Kiena, who was living in Fleetwood but originally from St Annes, went missing on Friday (July 22) and Kynan launched an 'urgent' appeal on social media to help find her
Within hours they received the devastating news that Kiena had died after being hit by a train
Friends said Kiena's mental health had been severely impacted
Four days before her death she posted a picture on Facebook with her dad saying: 2 years ago today you took your last breathe.
hope you stay with me through this nightmare I’m living and I will remember to have the strength you always did
Wish you were here, love you forever and a day dad
Writing on Facebook, Kynan said: We love you more than words can ever say! I’m going to miss you more than you’ll ever have known
You didn’t deserve this! And you will be remembered by everyone
I’ll make sure your baby girl will be looked after and grow up to know how perfect you really was

Responding to the GoFundMe appeal, Kynan said: This is absolutely amazing my family and little Marnie appreciate this so much
My gorgeous niece who now has no mum to grow up with will 100% appreciate what your all doing
I still can’t believe your gone Kiena
But I will make sure I look after Marnie and she will grow up to be the most perfect little girl
Just as you would have wanted.  RIP BEAUTIFUL

A GoFundMe page has been set up by Matthew Sanderson to support Kynan and Marnie and pay towards Kiena's funeral costs
It has already raised more than £8,500 against its £2,500 goal
Writing on the GoFundMe page, Matthew said: This is Marnie and her mummy, Marnie is only 9 months old and recently lost her mummy to a tragic suicide
Marnie is now being cared for by her uncle Kynan
Kynan has promised to be there for Marnie through thick and thin as he struggles to deal with the loss of his sister in such tragic circumstances
Kynan has also had to give up his employment as a builder to take care of Marnie which has already had a significant impact on Kynan’s finances
We are asking people not to let Kynan struggle alone
Please support Kynan so he can get a deposit to rent a house, buy some essentials for Marnie and pay towards his sisters funeral
Any excess funds will be placed in trust for Marnie once she turns 18
Thanks again and thanks for your support
It’s ok not to be ok! Please talk to someone and don’t suffer in silence
Kiena, who was living in Fleetwood but originally from St Annes, went missing on Friday (July 22) and Kynan launched an 'urgent' appeal on social media to help find her
Within hours they received the devastating news that Kiena had died after being hit by a train
Friends said Kiena's mental health had been severely impacted
Four days before her death she posted a picture on Facebook with her dad saying: 2 years ago today you took your last breathe.
hope you stay with me through this nightmare I’m living and I will remember to have the strength you always did
Wish you were here, love you forever and a day dad
Writing on Facebook, Kynan said: We love you more than words can ever say! I’m going to miss you more than you’ll ever have known
You didn’t deserve this! And you will be remembered by everyone
I’ll make sure your baby girl will be looked after and grow up to know how perfect you really was
What is happening where you live? Find out by adding your postcode
Responding to the GoFundMe appeal, Kynan said: This is absolutely amazing my family and little Marnie appreciate this so much
My gorgeous niece who now has no mum to grow up with will 100% appreciate what your all doing
I still can’t believe your gone Kiena
But I will make sure I look after Marnie and she will grow up to be the most perfect little girl
Just as you would have wanted.  RIP BEAUTIFUL
Friends and family have paid tribute on social media and well-wishers have been leaving flowers on railings in Carlyle Avenue, Blackpool, opposite the home of Kiena's mother

Popular and well-respected travel manager, Jennifer Joynt, 36, was found dead in her home after the love of a 'toxic partner' who allegedly faked his cancer consumed her A famous businesswoman was found dead after her whole life turned upside down and 'messed up' by a man who allegedly faked having stage four cancer in a bid to control her
Jennifer Joynt, 36, a supply chain manager, was tragically found dead in her bed by her dad, after he forced his way into her home in Manchester on February 26, report Manchester Evening News
Her family became concerned about her after they hadn't heard from her in days
An inquest into her death, held at South Manchester Coroner’s Court, heard the woman - who was born in Stockport - had experienced problems with her mental health in the past
The court heard that family and friends supported her during these difficult periods of her life
The inquest also outlined that while there were signs Ms Joynt was considering suicide, she did not appear to have taken her own life
Notes addressed to her family and friends in notebooks were found by police, scattered around her room
There were also notes on her phone, as well as video messages recorded for her loved ones, in the months before her death
Police found that while some of these notes had been edited on her mobile, there was nothing to indicate they were true indications that she intended to take her own life
Similar notes had also been written on other occasions, which had not led to her attempting to take her own life
There was evidence that Ms Joynt had attempted to purchase a particular drug, which has appeared in several other suicide inquests recently
While police were able to establish that most of the companies the 36-year-old reached out to had declined the sale
There was one purchase attempt that had not been declined, but officers were unable to establish whether the sale had gone through and whether the substance was delivered
Police said they could not find any evidence of packaging or a container for this substance in the home, although when Miss Joynt’s phone was unlocked by officers, they discovered that she had been visiting a site instructing her on what medications to take alongside this substance to take her own life
Traces of these drugs were found within her system
Professor Hunt, the pathologist who performed the post mortem examination of Miss Joynt, gave her cause of death as aspiration of gastric contents
This means that food or fluid she had consumed had caused a blockage in her windpipe or lungs
Toxicology results showed a range of non-lethal levels of various drugs in her system, but these were not highlighted as contributing factors to Miss Joynt’s death
Ms Joynt's mum, Margaret, told the court about her bubbly and strong daughter who embraced life and loved fitness and travelling
However, she also said an extremely toxic relationship in the months before her daughter's death consumed her, with the young woman unable to let go of her partner who allegedly faked having stage four cancer in a bid to control her
After a tough few months of set-backs, things started to look up for Miss Joynt, with the young woman in the process of buying a new house, set to start a new job just weeks after her death, and even taking trips away with friends and making plans to spend time with those around her
Her dad told the court his daughter spoke to people that were struggling and actively tried to help them and just seemed to love life so much, leaving her family feeling like she was finally turning a corner and starting to get better after a horrific ordeal
Senior coroner Alison Mutch recorded a narrative conclusion that Miss Joynt died from complications of asphyxia, as it was impossible to tell on the balance of probabilities whether or not the young woman had ingested something in an attempt to take her own life
Addressing Ms Joynt’s family she said: As a family you were devoted to each other and as parents you had supported her
She was obviously very popular and very successful, and was extremely well thought of at work and she had a very bright future ahead of her
She was extremely fortunate to have such a caring family
Ms Joynt’s family established the Jenni Joynt Foundation, which aims to help others who have faced, or are facing similar mental health challenges to which she succumbed
The 39-year-old was a well-known and hugely popular figure across the business travel industry
She had worked as a travel manager at NatWest Group/RBS since 2016, and was best-known as a long-time member of the Institute of Travel Management (ITM) and as an active and passionate member of its Northern Regional Committee
During her spare time, it is reported that she enjoyed a range of fitness activities, including open water swimming
ITM celebrated her life at its annual conference in Birmingham in April, with its CEO, Scott Davies, paying tribute to her
He said: Jenni was an incredibly special, vibrant and energetic member of the ITM community
Her natural desire to make everyone feel welcome and valued set the tone at our events and struck anyone that she met
Jenni’s warmth, humour, empathy and talent were admired by so many of us
Jenni would simply light up a room and any situation you can imagine – a business meeting, an education session, a conference, a gym class, an evening in a bar – was just infinitely better if Jenni was there
We miss her so much already and we will always remember her, and we will look to find positive ways to help those facing struggles any way we can

The American retail chain announced plans to close 150 stores out of its roughly 900, and sack 20 per cent of staff just two days before Gustavo Arnal's death in New York City A high-powered chief executive plunged to his death from the 18th floor of a famous tower after his company recorded record losses
Gustavo Arnal, Chief Financial Officer of Bed Bath & Beyond, took his life from the 18th floor of the famous 'Jenga' tower in lower Manhattan's Tribeca neighbourhood, New York City, on Friday
The American retail chain had been hugely struggling following the aftershocks of Covid-19 with high inflation and a sinking economy
The company announced plans to close 150 stores, of its roughly 900, and sack 20 percent of staff just two days before Mr Arnal's death
The announcement cause the business to lose nearly a quarter of its on Wednesday
He reportedly sold over 42,000 shares in the company for $1million just over two weeks ago, according to MarketBeat. com
But at the time of his death he still owned around $6. 5million in shares
Mr Arnal had only been with the company for two years and previously held the same role at British cosmetics giant Avon and had a 20-year career working overseas leading Procter & Gamble
Emergency service calls regarding someone jumping at 56 Leonard Street were recorded at around 12:30pm according to a spokeswoman for the New York Police Department
Beth, Bath & Beyond said it had secured $500 million in new financing but shares continued to plunge and fell as much as 25 percent in one mornings trading
When Mr Arnal joined Bed, Bath & Beyond in April 2020 a company spokesman said in a statement they were bringing in world class talent to offer new perspectives, expertise and experience as we rebuild our business
Gustavo exemplifies this and his experience delivering business transformation at other leading companies, his deep knowledge of the retail and consumer goods space, as well as his energy and drive will help accelerate our transformation plans
He held an undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Universidad Simon Bolivar in Colombia, and a master’s degree in Finance from the Universidad Metropolitana in Venezuela.
National Association of State Emergency Medical Services Officials were seen carrying the man's body in a black body bag
The building has 57 floors and is 243 metres high

Richard Jeavons, 37, was found dead in the living room of his home in Chelmsley Wood, West Midlands - police tried to save his life, but CPR efforts failed to revive him A dad-of-four tragically took his own life after a series of mental health struggles and drug misuse, an inquest heard
Richard Jeavons, 37, was found dead in the living room of his home in Chelmsley Wood, West Midlands, on December 2
He had penned heartfelt notes to his boys and parents before his death
Police tried to save his life, but CPR efforts failed to revive him, Birmingham Live reports
Richard, a Birmingham-born electrician, was struggling after sad news he would no longer be able to see his children after a dangerous driving conviction
He was given the news as he was handed a two-year community order for theft, attempted theft, assault and dangerous driving in September last year
He was told he could not have contact until his sons turned 18, banned from driving for 18 months and ordered to pay £200 compensation alongside a £100 fine
Assistant Coroner Rebecca Ollivere recorded a verdict of suicide as the inquest concluded at Birmingham Coroner's Court on Tuesday, April 19
The inquest heard how he was suffering from emotionally unstable personality disorder, substance misuse, ADHD and drug-related psychotic symptoms
When he was first referred to the early intervention service at Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Trust in 2018, he had been motivated to engage
Miss Ollivere told the court: He struggled with his mental health and substance misuse
He also had a history of various suicide attempts over the years and he had ADHD
Richard was referred to the early intervention service, and he remained with them for three years
It became apparent during this time that his psychosis was not related to a specific mental health condition, but was due to his misuse of drugs
He was discharged into the community and allocated a care coordinator
But over the summer of 2021, he became very unstable and he was added to the waiting list for a hospital bed
While awaiting a bed, his mental state improved and after further review, it was decided it was no longer required, the assistant coroner continued
In September, he received upsetting news that he was no longer going to be able to have contact with his children
However, by November, his mental state had improved somewhat and he was engaging with services
Losing contact with his children led to Richard increasing his substance misuse and suffering from low moods
However, he was trying to engage with the services by attending cycling groups and narcotics anonymous
He managed to reduce his substance misuse and on December 1, he called his care coordinator, Geraldine Avis, to discuss his future
Richard was even humorous as he spoke of plans to go into town and get a job, get fit for the summer, buy a car and obtain a bus pass, she told the inquest
He gave no indication that he would harm himself, the court heard
But within hours, police officers were called to his Birmingham home - where he was sadly found dead alongside two suicide notes for his children and parents
The assistant coroner added: Later that night, officers were called to Richard's address after reports of a male with a knife
Sadly when officers gained entry to the property, they found him in his living room and despite CPR being attempted, sadly he could not be revived
No care or service delivery problems or missed opportunities were found in his care, a root cause analysis concluded

David Hunter is charged with murdering his wife of 52 years Janice in December, but insists it was her wish to die
Now, he has told his daughter he wants to kill himself Retired coal miner David Hunter told his daughter he would kill himself at the first opportunity after failing in a suicide pact with his terminally ill wife in Cyprus
David, 74, is charged with murdering his wife of 52 years Janice in December, but insists it was her wish to die
He is alleged to have suffocated leukaemia-stricken Janice before taking an overdose of prescription pills, however he was found and survived
Daughter Lesley Cawthorne, 49, who is supporting her dad, has revealed his agony as he faces a life sentence unless the charge is reduced to assisted dying
Speaking to her from jail in Cypriot capital Nicosia, he told her last week: I do not know how to live without her
I’m Janice’s husband, and without her, I don’t really know who I am
David, a miner for 40 years in his native Northumberland before the pair moved to retire in Cyprus, says he acted out of love for 75-year-old Janice
Janice had begged David for him to end her pain, Lesley says
When Lesley first spoke to him after events in December – in a tearful call as he lay in a Paphos hospital – he told her: I’m so sorry, I love you, but I want to be with your mum
I’m so sorry but as soon as I get a chance, I will kill myself
Lesley begged him not to, saying she could not lose them both
There are people out there doing bad things, she says
All my dad did was love someone
Janice was diagnosed with blood cancer in 2016, and both she and David had endured heartbreak in the late 1980s that influenced their decision more than 30 years later, Lesley said
Janice’s sister Kath died of leukaemia and Janice had vowed not to endure the same pain should she face a similar fate
While David’s mum Rachel died of ovarian cancer, and Lesley recalls how Rachel had asked her son: Just make it stop David, I’m so tired
Lesley told the Mirror how her dad talks to mum every night from his cell, which he shares with nine other men
He dreams of his wife’s screams of pain as her blood cancer took hold
He adored her, a tearful Lesley tells us
The only thing he really cared about was giving his family a nice life
Now it’s ended like this there’s a real possibility he will die alone in a foreign prison
I cannot bear the thought of anyone thinking badly of my dad, because my dad really is the loveliest of men
Lesley calls David every day and every time she is relieved to hear his voice
Lesley, a compliance consultant, said
He’s sad and very lonely
In his better moments, David tells how he longs to be back in Ashington, Northumberland, and to walk along the beach
He talks about mum all the time
He tries to remember the good times and looks back on family holidays
Janice’s side of the family fully supports David, Lesley said
They just want him home – they love him
Mum begged him for a long time (to assist her death) and was very clear about what she wanted
She was very much of the opinion that we have autonomy over our bodies
David had told Lesley that Janice asked him to help her to die but she says: My dad was very good at reassuring me
They never really let on how bad she was
She says her parents suffered with Covid lockdowns, which she claims made it harder to get medical support
David will face a life sentence in Cyprus for a murder charge, while assisted suicide carries a maximum sentence of 10 years
He pleaded not guilty to murder in a February court hearing in Cyprus
Lesley is raising funds for legal fees via the Crowd Justice website with the total at £14,000 so far
But time is running out, as David’s trial in Paphos begins on April 18
Michael Polak, of UK-based Justice Abroad, is representing David
The group has written to the island’s attorney general to ask for the charge to be downgraded
We will be doing everything we can to get David home, he said
It is in the public interest that he does not spend the rest of his life in prison
Nobody I’ve spoken to in Cyprus believes David Hunter should be on trial for murder
Police turned up at Lesley’s door in Norwich on December 18 to explain the situation in Cyprus
David had called his brother after taking an overdose and asked him to look after Lesley
His brother contacted UK police, who contacted Interpol and David was soon found
It is unclear if a note was left as items taken from the home have not yet been given to the defence
The next day David explained to Lesley that her mum had been in constant agony, and felt she had lost all her dignity – she had continual diarrhoea, was suffering horrific nosebleeds and her sight was going
She was unable to eat, drink or sleep, despite being exhausted
Lesley said David was unable to get her upstairs so they lay in reclining chairs downstairs, holding hands
Lesley, who has a pathological fear of flying, was unable to attend the funeral in Cyprus but helped to organise it

Get email updates with the day's biggest stories David Hunter is charged with murdering his wife of 52 years Janice in December, but insists it was her wish to die
Now, he has told his daughter he wants to kill himself Retired coal miner David Hunter told his daughter he would kill himself at the first opportunity after failing in a suicide pact with his terminally ill wife in Cyprus
David, 74, is charged with murdering his wife of 52 years Janice in December, but insists it was her wish to die
He is alleged to have suffocated leukaemia-stricken Janice before taking an overdose of prescription pills, however he was found and survived
Daughter Lesley Cawthorne, 49, who is supporting her dad, has revealed his agony as he faces a life sentence unless the charge is reduced to assisted dying
Speaking to her from jail in Cypriot capital Nicosia, he told her last week: I do not know how to live without her
I’m Janice’s husband, and without her, I don’t really know who I am
David, a miner for 40 years in his native Northumberland before the pair moved to retire in Cyprus, says he acted out of love for 75-year-old Janice
Janice had begged David for him to end her pain, Lesley says
When Lesley first spoke to him after events in December – in a tearful call as he lay in a Paphos hospital – he told her: I’m so sorry, I love you, but I want to be with your mum
I’m so sorry but as soon as I get a chance, I will kill myself
Lesley begged him not to, saying she could not lose them both
There are people out there doing bad things, she says
All my dad did was love someone
Janice was diagnosed with blood cancer in 2016, and both she and David had endured heartbreak in the late 1980s that influenced their decision more than 30 years later, Lesley said
Janice’s sister Kath died of leukaemia and Janice had vowed not to endure the same pain should she face a similar fate
While David’s mum Rachel died of ovarian cancer, and Lesley recalls how Rachel had asked her son: Just make it stop David, I’m so tired
Lesley told the Mirror how her dad talks to mum every night from his cell, which he shares with nine other men
He dreams of his wife’s screams of pain as her blood cancer took hold
He adored her, a tearful Lesley tells us
The only thing he really cared about was giving his family a nice life
Now it’s ended like this there’s a real possibility he will die alone in a foreign prison
I cannot bear the thought of anyone thinking badly of my dad, because my dad really is the loveliest of men
Lesley calls David every day and every time she is relieved to hear his voice
Lesley, a compliance consultant, said
He’s sad and very lonely
In his better moments, David tells how he longs to be back in Ashington, Northumberland, and to walk along the beach
He talks about mum all the time
He tries to remember the good times and looks back on family holidays
Janice’s side of the family fully supports David, Lesley said
They just want him home – they love him
Mum begged him for a long time (to assist her death) and was very clear about what she wanted
She was very much of the opinion that we have autonomy over our bodies
David had told Lesley that Janice asked him to help her to die but she says: My dad was very good at reassuring me
They never really let on how bad she was
She says her parents suffered with Covid lockdowns, which she claims made it harder to get medical support
David will face a life sentence in Cyprus for a murder charge, while assisted suicide carries a maximum sentence of 10 years
He pleaded not guilty to murder in a February court hearing in Cyprus
Lesley is raising funds for legal fees via the Crowd Justice website with the total at £14,000 so far
But time is running out, as David’s trial in Paphos begins on April 18
Michael Polak, of UK-based Justice Abroad, is representing David
The group has written to the island’s attorney general to ask for the charge to be downgraded
We will be doing everything we can to get David home, he said
It is in the public interest that he does not spend the rest of his life in prison
Nobody I’ve spoken to in Cyprus believes David Hunter should be on trial for murder
Police turned up at Lesley’s door in Norwich on December 18 to explain the situation in Cyprus
David had called his brother after taking an overdose and asked him to look after Lesley
His brother contacted UK police, who contacted Interpol and David was soon found
It is unclear if a note was left as items taken from the home have not yet been given to the defence
The next day David explained to Lesley that her mum had been in constant agony, and felt she had lost all her dignity – she had continual diarrhoea, was suffering horrific nosebleeds and her sight was going
She was unable to eat, drink or sleep, despite being exhausted
Lesley said David was unable to get her upstairs so they lay in reclining chairs downstairs, holding hands
Lesley, who has a pathological fear of flying, was unable to attend the funeral in Cyprus but helped to organise it
Janice would have turned 76 on March 30, and the day after marked the 57th anniversary of when they first met in a pub in Ashington
He thought she was the most beautiful girl in the town, Lesley recalls
She came over and said: ‘You can buy me a drink if you want’

Paula Halliday, 33, worked as an auxiliary nurse and after a number of failings from health services she took her own life as she struggled with a traumatic event where something happened in London A young mum has tragically taken her own life after a number of failings from medical services as she experienced a traumatic event the year before in London
Paula Halliday had struggled with her mental health and hadn’t seen her two young girls since the incident in October 2021
In the time since, on a number of occasions, she took overdoses and said she wanted to kill herself, Lancs Live reported
The 33-year-old from High Wycombe was being seen by mental health services - but a number of failings meant she didn’t receive the care she should have
When she killed herself, her body was found by her then partner and she had left a number of notes including one that simply read: It’s my time
An inquest into her death at Preston Crown Court heard how the auxiliary nurse began seeing Amy Cooper in September 2021
Speaking to the inquest, Miss Cooper said: I rang the crisis team once when she was texting me at night because she was just beside herself and I didn't know what to do
She was drinking a lot, every day
In October 2021 something happened in London and she was quite traumatised by it
She was seeing someone from the mental health team every week and they would ring her every other day to check in on her but she felt let down by them and said they weren't listening to her
She was always seeing someone different so she kept having to go over what happened every time and she found that really distressing
Samantha Ferguson, a matron at Lancashire Care which is part of Lancashire and South Cumbria NHS Foundation Trust which provides mental health services, admitted there had been several failings in Paula's care
The inquest heard that the team had been unwilling to start any psychiatric treatment or medication until Paula managed to reduce her alcohol intake
The matron said: Handovers weren't always fully completed and risks weren't always discussed.  It was sporadic
Some people had to look through the notes to familiarise themselves with her
She saw a number of different people at her face-to-face appointments which isn't ideal
What we would have liked to have been better was not necessarily more face-to-face appointments but better documented telephone calls and the ability to escalate a higher evidence of risk
And more face-to-face contact would have been expected given the high level of risk
What crimes have been reported in your neighbourhood? Check with In Your Area
The inquest, which was attended by a large number of Paula's friends and relatives, heard that a number of changes have been brought in at the trust
This included plans to increase staffing and issuing stricter guidance when handing over patients during morning meetings
Staff have also been trained on the importance of clinical curiosity, documenting clinical history and risk assessments
Claire Gibson, a consultant nurse at LSCFT, apologised to Paula's family for the failings in her care
She added: I want to apologise because there were some failings and I am really sorry
On the morning of January 13 this year Miss Cooper had driven to Paula's house to pick her up and take her to work
Although Paula hadn't replied to any of her texts this was normal given how heavily Paula had been drinking

Amy then went inside the house in Morecambe where she found Paula dead
Returning a conclusion of suicide Area Coroner Richard Taylor said he was satisfied that Paula had done a deliberate act with the intention of ending her life
Of course she was high risk and her frustrations about not getting the treatment she wanted are understandable, he added
In the notes she left she wasn't rambling
It was thought out and considered
The fact that so many people are here today goes to show how much she is missed and loved
A page on GoFundMe set up after Paula's death raised £730 in her name for the NSPCC
Friends posted their tributes to her in the comments with one describing her as a very special person while another said she was a beautiful lady

Matt Lloyd, 54, spent six weeks in ICU and on a burns unit at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, undergoing total of four operations following the self-harming incident last August A dad suffered 70% full body burns as a result of self-harming
Matt Lloyd had suffered a breakdown in a 12-year relationship at the time of the incident - and has thanked hospital staff for saving his life
The 54-year-old was rushed to Glasgow Royal Infirmary last August before spending six weeks in intensive care and then being transferred to the burns unit
He underwent a total of four operations, reports the Daily Record
The first thing he remembers on waking up was asking to speak to his two sons, and admits he feels guilty about what he put them through
Speaking about the heroic medical staff who treated him, Matt said: I really believe that without their help, I wouldn’t be here
They saved me and gave me back to my sons
With 60-70 per cent full-body burns, doctors operated quickly to save Matt’s life and prevent further damage to his muscles
He told his sons and the rest of the family he was in a desperate place prior to the incident
He said: I felt so guilty about what I had put them (his sons) through and explained to them and my family that I didn’t do it because I didn’t love them
I just didn’t love myself at that time
During his time on the burns unit Matt was looked after by physiotherapists, occupational therapists and healthcare support workers, as well as mental health teams who address the impacts of the trauma

Catriona Murray, a senior physiotherapist on the unit, said: A burn injury is often a life-changing injury, not just for the patient, but for their family too
We come together as a team, to help encourage functional tasks, our goal is to help get people back to functioning as they were before their injury
Thanking the nursing team, Matt said: I really believe that without their help, I wouldn’t be here

Pictures of Steffan Rees are not what people expect to see after he took his own life
They show pure joy and happiness as he teaches his baby niece a joyful song The final images of a man before his life ended are what his family want everyone to see
Pictures of Steffan Rees are not what people expect to see after he took his own life
They show pure joy and happiness as he teaches his baby niece If You Are Happy And You Know It
Stefan's sister Sian, from Cardigan, Wales, says her brother was the life and soul of the party and the kind of person who lit up the room when he arrived
Wales On line reports it is why his suicide was such a shock and drives his devastated sister to help others
She said: I couldn't have asked for a better brother
He was only 26, had a loving family, a beautiful girlfriend, and didn't say anything about having any mental health issues
Since his death Sian has tried to find positives
Together with widows Lisa and Ana, who have also been bereaved through suicide, they have set up a support group and taken part in a UK awareness campaign
New research from suicide prevention charity Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) has found that 61% of people would struggle to tell if someone they knew felt suicidal
The charity wants to raise awareness that the ‘face of suicide’ isn’t always crying and being recluse
A person might seem happy on the outside, and to illustrate this, the charity has unveiled an exhibition on London’s Southbank called 'The Last Photo'
The outdoor gallery displays 50 smiling photos taken in the last days of people who died by suicide
It also shares the stories of shock and grief their families and friends experienced
A photograph of Steffan forms part of the moving exhibition, as do the pictures of Peter Hammett, from Swansea, and Lee, from Tenby
Along with Sian, Peter's wife Lisa and Lee's wife Ana have set up a support group - LISS - Living in Suicide Shadow because they felt there was a lack of support for those bereaved by suicide
Ana said: We are a peer-to-peer support group that aims to break the 'isolation' that we often find ourselves in by organising face to face and virtual meet ups, walks, family activities with people that understand the pain of suicide
The latest figures show that 125 people die by suicide every week in the UK, but it can be hard to spot the signs something isn’t okay Just months after Ana's husband died of suicide another CALM's project called 84, which represented the number of people who died every week in the UK in 2018, was launched
Ana, whose children were nine and six when her husband died, said: The 84 project floored me
It had such a powerful message; I couldn't believe 84 men took their lives every week… so many families, friends, and communities heartbroken
Suddenly, my husband's individual act was not so individual anymore
If the suicide average was constant, how can we blame such rates of suicide on one individual's reckless decision? It felt much more like a social issue, and if it was the case, then we could do something about it
Talking about this campaign she said: I will never forget those beautiful smiles of those beautiful people… beautiful children, beautiful women, handsome men, different ages, different genders, different social classes, different ethnicities, proof that suicide can happen to anyone
The shadows of the leaves moving with the wind and the sun created movement in the photos
I kept looking and hoping that they would start moving
And even though it was so comforting to see a life-size picture, I found it so hard to leave the exhibition; I wanted to bring him home with me, we miss Lee so much! The picture of Lee, who was 41 when he died, was taken in Castell Henllys, Pembrokeshire, on a wonderful day out with friends
There were Roman attacks, and Celtic victories, plenty of laughter and at one point Lee had all the kids shoeless crossing the stream in the cold April
Never in a million years would any of us believe that he would be gone less than a couple of months later
Our children were only six and nine when he died
He loved them to bits and was always with them
They would say 'but daddy was always happy with he was with me'
It was not long after Lee's death that Ana met Lisa, through Dr Dai Lloyd, an MS who has been heavily involved in suicide prevention campaigns
Ana added: Things have moved on a lot in recent years, but there is a lot of stigma around suicide
People would say things like he is your husband, you live with him, how did you not see it, some people blame you for it, others don't know what to say
It is said that we lose around 70% of our circle of family and friends as it is difficult for people to understand and support our grief
Being able to talk with other people who have been through the same experience has helped
The group has helped the three form a close bond
We have been on a journey together the last couple of years and it seemed fitting that we should all be taking part in The Last Photo campaign and supporting each other, she said
The exhibition was held on the Southbank somewhere I'd previously visited with my family including Peter with such happy memories
My immediate reaction when I saw the life size photo of Peter was to cry
I placed my hand upon his face in disbelief remembering this photo I had taken on our 33rd wedding anniversary just three months before he died
She added: When Peter died I was determined to make a stand against the stigma associated with suicide and for his death not to be in vein I'm so proud we all took part in CALMs The Last Photo campaign
We hope all our stories make a difference and ultimately save lives

An inquest has heard how Bailey Reay, 13, sent a heartbreaking 'final goodbye' voice-note to his crush, before being found unresponsive at his grandmother's home A 13-year-old schoolboy sent a heartbreaking final 'last goodbye' message to a girl he fancied before his tragic death, an inquest has heard
Bailey Reay, from Sunderland, was found unresponsive at his grandmother's home where he lived on 19 December 2020
Emergency services were immediately called, but he was tragically pronounced dead - leaving his family and friends devastated, report Chronicle Live
An inquest - held at City Hall on Wednesday - heard how Bailey resided with his grandmother
On December 18, he was left in the care of his grandmother's aunt and they spent some time together eating pizza
It was also heard how Bailey also spent some time in his room playing on his PlayStation
But, by midday on December 19, Bailey was found unresponsive and the emergency services were called but he tragically passed away
The teenager was found in his room with an empty bottle of medication that was originally prescribed to his grandmother
A post-mortem was carried out and toxicology was taken and it was found that Bailey had alcohol and medication, which was eight times a large therapeutic dose, in his system
The pathologist found that Bailey died as a result of the effects of the medication and alcohol which it was heard can impact the central nervous system
The inquest heard there were a number of things that caused Bailey concern including difficult family dynamics and school though recent records suggested he had got back into school and that it seemed to be going well
Following Bailey's death, some concerns were raised over the issue of bullying and police seized his computer and mobile phone which was protected by a pin
However, the inquest heard that nothing specific was identified
However, they did find a voicemail that Bailey had left a girl who he had a crush on which said: I have had a crush on you for the longest time so I guess this is goodbye
Assistant coroner, Karin Welsh, said Bailey had admitted taking medication in the voicemail he left to his crush and recorded a verdict of suicide
She told his family: Why doesn't fall within the remit of an inquest
There were a number of factors in Bailey's life that must have been causing him concern

Bailey Reay, from Sunderland, was found unresponsive at his grandmother's home where he lived on 19 December 2020
Emergency services were immediately called, but he was tragically pronounced dead - leaving his family and friends devastated, report Chronicle Live
An inquest - held at City Hall on Wednesday - heard how Bailey resided with his grandmother
On December 18, he was left in the care of his grandmother's aunt and they spent some time together eating pizza
It was also heard how Bailey also spent some time in his room playing on his PlayStation
But, by midday on December 19, Bailey was found unresponsive and the emergency services were called but he tragically passed away
The teenager was found in his room with an empty bottle of medication that was originally prescribed to his grandmother
A post-mortem was carried out and toxicology was taken and it was found that Bailey had alcohol and medication, which was eight times a large therapeutic dose, in his system
The pathologist found that Bailey died as a result of the effects of the medication and alcohol which it was heard can impact the central nervous system
The inquest heard there were a number of things that caused Bailey concern including difficult family dynamics and school though recent records suggested he had got back into school and that it seemed to be going well
Following Bailey's death, some concerns were raised over the issue of bullying and police seized his computer and mobile phone which was protected by a pin
However, the inquest heard that nothing specific was identified
However, they did find a voicemail that Bailey had left a girl who he had a crush on which said: I have had a crush on you for the longest time so I guess this is goodbye
Assistant coroner, Karin Welsh, said Bailey had admitted taking medication in the voicemail he left to his crush and recorded a verdict of suicide
She told his family: Why doesn't fall within the remit of an inquest
There were a number of factors in Bailey's life that must have been causing him concern

WARNING DISTRESSING CONTENT: A mum who plunged to her death searched for the means of taking her own life the day before she did
Raquel Wilkins' death was ruled a murder-suicide A woman who calmly looked her boyfriend in the eye as she fell to her death off a balcony holding their son looked up easy suicide on Google before she died
Raquel Wilkins, 40, was killed with her two-year-old son Denzel Wilkins-Browning when she stepped off a high point of the Petco arena, a baseball stadium in downtown San Diego, California, in the US
The San Diego Police ruled her death on September 29 a murder -suicide after the six-storey fall killed both Raquel and Denzel
The family of Raquel contested the ruling and one witness said that while standing on a bench she again lost her balance and this time, fell over the edge
She had already been seen on the bench and nearly losing her balance
They added: From my vantage point, looking at her back, it was almost like she rolled over the railing
Her sudden decision to fall seemed odd as the pair were seen happy and laughing on the day and the family's attorney claimed the ruling was useful for the owners of the stadium, as reported by the San Diego Tribune
He claimed: The city of San Diego owns that ballpark, it is legally responsible, assuming that what caused her to fall was anything but her intent
The only way the city is not at fault is if she intended to kill herself and her baby
Lieutenant Andra Brown said the police had come to the murder-suicide conclusion after detectives conducted a thorough and comprehensive investigation that included dozens of interviews, reviewing of available video footage, and collecting background information to determine what led to the deaths
The boyfriend of Raquel contests the idea that her death was an accident and said it was very intentional, very planned
Christopher Browning said she all of a sudden stared straight at him with an eerie silence, like in a movie
It was so quick, so fast, he added to the New York Post
Both of them went over.  It was very quiet
I was in complete shock
Another witness backed up Christopher's claims in a police report and argued the act was completely intentional
Her demeanour walking up was so calm
She didn’t even look down
It looked just like she was trying to hop over a fence
Raquel's mental state in the months leading up to her death had reportedly deteriorated and had broken down in front of her boyfriend before
She had searched for tips for taking her own life on her phone the day before
To grieve in a healthy way, you have to honour the truth, Christopher said

A heartbroken family have paid tribute to a 'strong' mother who was tragically found dead by her partner as he returned home from taking their daughter out for food A devastated family have paid tribute to a 'strong' mum who left them shocked after she sadly took her own life
Coroners heard this week how Indre Razutyte, 31, was discovered at her Pontefract home by partner Nathan Price along with police after he returned with their young daughter from a meal
The mother and transport manager was declared dead at the scene by paramedics shortly after, reports YorkshireLive
Her death on March 22 was ruled as a suicide at Wakefield Coroner's Court on Tuesday (July 26)
A statement from Nathan to the coroner confirmed that he and Lithuania-born Indre had split up in the days before the tragic incident, and had since begun discussing how to co-parent their daughter
He recalled having been to Indra's house earlier on the day to take the child out for food, but had received no reply when he texted her on the way back
Discovering the house empty with the lights off upon reaching the house, he took his daughter inside through an unlocked conservatory at the back before noticing written notes on the kitchen worktop
I saw notes on the kitchen counter when I walked in
I was concerned on reading them - I was worried and called the police, he said
Police officers arrived at 7
02pm and the three searched for Indre
PC Barraclough was the first to spot her through the glass doors that led to the garage and an ambulance was called
Nathan and PC Barraclough managed to break the window that led to the garage, where they found Indre
CPR was attempted but paramedics tragically pronounced her dead at 7. 33pm
Indre's mother said a written statement read by Assistant Coroner John Hobson that Indra's death had come as a complete shock, with her strong daughter having made plans to return planning to visit her back home in Lithuania only days before
Recalling their text conversations in the days before her passing, she said: The conversations were quite normal with nothing that caused any worries
It's very difficult for me to believe and understand
Indre was a very strong person and never displayed any signs that would have caused her to take her own life
I last visited her and Nathan in October 2021 - they both did appear different and like they may go their separate ways
I believed they were trying to reconcile
Mr Hobson concluded he was satisfied that Indre's cause of death was suicide
Addressing her mother, he said: I offer my condolences to you and thank you for your endeavours in coming to the country to be here for your daughter today
My condolences to Indre's daughter as well and also to Mr Price

Retired police officer and dad-of-three Haydn Morgan said his beloved daughter Bronwen, 26, suffered a devastating injustice in relation to her mental health care while she trained to be a psychiatric nurse at Cardiff University Parents who camped outside their beloved daughter's room to stop her harming herself have shared their heartbreak after she tragically took her own life
Haydn Morgan and his wife Jayne took it in turns to sleep on a camper bed against the door of their 26-year-old daughteer Bronwen's room so she wouldn't escape, self-harm or take her own life
Dad-of-three Haydn said his daughter - who was studying to be a mental health nurse at Cardiff University - didn't like it, but they couldn't let her out of our sight because of the risk she posed to herself
He added: It was the only way we could keep her safe
Haydn - who says his daughter suffered a devastating injustice in her care - said he and his wife fought for Bronwen to be admitted to a psychiatric war but it was always refused
He said: We just didn't know where to turn
It had all been so different just a few years earlier
Growing up Bronwen Morgan was a talented swimmer, played the piano and was a popular Girl Guide
She also loved working with children and had a natural way of connecting with them
Before long she found herself a job in the behavioural unit at her old primary school where she earned the nickname Bomb-proof Bron as she was always calm and in control under pressure
But during her time in Cardiff University, where she was training to become a mental health nurse, her own bouts of anxiety and depression intensified and she developed an eating disorder
Her problems were further exacerbated by the pandemic when the usual activities she needed to manage her mental health disappeared virtually overnight
This coincided with the services of her community psychiatric nurse (CPN) being taken away without warning
Haydn, a dad-of-three, added that Bronwen would frequently be detained by police under the Mental Health Act and sent to Hafan Y Coed, a specialist psychiatric unit on the grounds of University Hospital Llandough
However he claims she would often be discharged from the unit without the family knowing which led to her going missing
Bronwen began to feel helpless and isolated which meant her mental health spiralled out of control and left her in a place that she felt she could not find a way back from, added Haydn, from Cyncoed, Cardiff
After many months of pain and trauma, Bronwen was allegedly told by medical staff that if she were to find herself in a crisis in the future, the police would arrest her
This decision, her family claims, was the final straw
Haydn, a retired police officer, admitted that he has struggled to shake the memory of the last day he saw Bronwen alive
He recalled: That week she was happy, smiling and in a really good place
We hadn't seen her like that for ages
Unbeknown to us she had this plan to take her own life
In a way she was saying goodbye to us, but nobody knew
She had been trying to do it for a long time
We've been told she was probably feeling a sense of elation and a sense of knowing that 'I'm going to take my life and my family will be able to get on with their lives'
Bronwen was found unresponsive at a hotel in Cardiff and died on Thursday, August 27, 2020
As well as writing to Cardiff and Vale University Health Board in a last-ditch cry for help, she penned a letter to her mum, dad and two younger sisters, Tesni and Cerys
She said she wanted us to know that she had the best childhood ever and that we'd done nothing wrong
It was just heartbreaking, added Haydn
We had literally lost all hope
We couldn't find a way of going forward and her mental health team had locked her in this cocoon and insisted that this was the therapy she should be having
Haydn, who is now seeing a therapist himself, added: Now I'm retired, you see photographs of her around the house all the time and it brings it all back
I've been miserable, tired and angry - I think we all have
Her heartbroken family claims that if they had been given more of a say in her care - which would have led to a more tailored and bespoke approach - she could still be alive today
They said Bronwen experienced a devastating injustice in her care and was treated with a blanket approach which had little effect on improving her mental health
Since the tragedy, Bronwen's family have set up Bronwen's Wish, a charity which aims to provide safe spaces for young people experiencing challenges with their mental health
It aims to provide wellbeing pods in primary and secondary schools which will act as quiet, relaxing and safe places for pupils who want to talk about their mental health
In June, Haydn and his dog Celog plan to walk the entire Pembrokeshire coastal path in one go - the equivalent distance to climbing Everest - to raise money for Bronwen's Wish
To donate to the challenge, dubbed 'Man and Mutt climb Everest', please go here
It'll take three weeks in all as I have arthritis in both knees so I'll likely need some rest days
We'll use a few campsites along the way, do some wild camping and hopefully a night on the sofa halfway around
I know Bron will be in my thoughts the whole time
A full inquest into Bronwen's death is set to take place between May 23 and 25 and the family are making a complaint against Cardiff and Vale University Health Board for failures in her care
A spokeswoman for the health board said: Our thoughts are with the family and friends of Bronwen at this incredibly sad time
An investigation report has been shared with the family and we reiterate the offer for a further meeting to discuss the findings

Police in the US believe prisoner Casey White wasn't smart enough to plan the breakout and said exemplary employee Vicky White was in the perfect position to organise it all A prison guard who took her own life after being on the run with a murderer for 11 days was the mastermind behind the the whole plan, police believe
Hulking 6ft9 prisoner Casey White - alleged to have been officer Vicky White's lover - wasn't smart enough to plan it all, according to Lauderdale County Sheriff Rick Singleton
In an interview with CNN, Singleton said 56-year-old Vicky - who he described as an exemplary employee - was in a position to coordinate the jailbreak, organising a van in the morning and ensuring all the armed deputies were not in the building
She knew that the booking officer wasn’t going to question her, the assistant director, when she told her that she was going to take him to court and drop him off with other employees, Singleton told the network
Not long before she died by suicide, Vicky seemed to be angry at Casey, 38, for deciding to stay at a motel
Some of her last words were recorded by police as officers rammed into the pair's Cadillac into a ditch after a dramatic chase
She's heard saying: Airbags are going off
Let’s get out and run
And then: You had to stay in some f****** motel
Vicky, who had made up a bogus medical appointment for the felon on April 29, shot herself moments later
Singleton said wigs, weapons including an AR-15 rifle, a 9mm handgun and $29,000 worth of cash had also been found
He said Vicky had sold her house to raise the funds
She would have been facing up to 10 years in prison for helping Casey escape
Singleton said Vicky, formerly second command at Alabama's Lauderdale County Jail, was a much liked, respected employee who other staff viewed as a mother figure
She was even about to be awarded Employee of the Year for the fifth time
What in the world provoked her, or prompted her, to pull something like this, I don’t know
I don’t know if we’ll ever know, he said
I had every bit of trust in Vicky White
She had been an exemplary employee
Casey appeared before a judge in Alabama on Tuesday night charged with escaping prison
Previously Vanderburgh County Sheriff Dave Wedding said that because a large number of guns were found inside the car, if Vicky and Casey they had not been rammed off the road the day could have ended with more bloodshed
He told reporters: We later found out that [if they hadn’t rammed the vehicle], the fugitive was going to engage in a shootout with law enforcement
That action may have saved many of my deputies and fellow law enforcement officers’ lives
The couple, who were not related, are said to have been in a jailhouse romance for around two years
Their dramatic escape came on the eve of Vicky’s retirement as a correctional officer
Since their 2020 meeting, Vicky had regularly been driving the two hours to where Casey was incarcerated, at the William E Donaldson Correctional Facility
She gave a false name to prison authorities
Get email updates with the day's biggest stories Police in the US believe prisoner Casey White wasn't smart enough to plan the breakout and said exemplary employee Vicky White was in the perfect position to organise it all A prison guard who took her own life after being on the run with a murderer for 11 days was the mastermind behind the the whole plan, police believe
Hulking 6ft9 prisoner Casey White - alleged to have been officer Vicky White's lover - wasn't smart enough to plan it all, according to Lauderdale County Sheriff Rick Singleton
In an interview with CNN, Singleton said 56-year-old Vicky - who he described as an exemplary employee - was in a position to coordinate the jailbreak, organising a van in the morning and ensuring all the armed deputies were not in the building
She knew that the booking officer wasn’t going to question her, the assistant director, when she told her that she was going to take him to court and drop him off with other employees, Singleton told the network
Not long before she died by suicide, Vicky seemed to be angry at Casey, 38, for deciding to stay at a motel
Some of her last words were recorded by police as officers rammed into the pair's Cadillac into a ditch after a dramatic chase
She's heard saying: Airbags are going off
Let’s get out and run
And then: You had to stay in some f****** motel
Vicky, who had made up a bogus medical appointment for the felon on April 29, shot herself moments later
Singleton said wigs, weapons including an AR-15 rifle, a 9mm handgun and $29,000 worth of cash had also been found
He said Vicky had sold her house to raise the funds
She would have been facing up to 10 years in prison for helping Casey escape
Singleton said Vicky, formerly second command at Alabama's Lauderdale County Jail, was a much liked, respected employee who other staff viewed as a mother figure
She was even about to be awarded Employee of the Year for the fifth time
What in the world provoked her, or prompted her, to pull something like this, I don’t know
I don’t know if we’ll ever know, he said
I had every bit of trust in Vicky White
She had been an exemplary employee
Casey appeared before a judge in Alabama on Tuesday night charged with escaping prison
Previously Vanderburgh County Sheriff Dave Wedding said that because a large number of guns were found inside the car, if Vicky and Casey they had not been rammed off the road the day could have ended with more bloodshed
He told reporters: We later found out that [if they hadn’t rammed the vehicle], the fugitive was going to engage in a shootout with law enforcement

A dad in Orlando, in the US, is believed to have killed his wife and three daughters in a suspected murder-suicide
Donovan Michael Ramirez and his family were found dead at their home A dad is accused of brutally executing his family before turning the gun on himself in a murder-suicide
Donovan Michael Ramirez, 45, allegedly murdered his three daughters and wife in a disturbing murder-suicide in Orlando, Florida, in the US
Victims of the attack were daughters Alyssa Berumen, 22, Sunny Ramirez, 11, and Shelby Rose Ramirez, 7, and they were killed alongside their mum, 39-year-old Renee Ramirez
The family was found dead on Tuesday after they were called to conduct a welfare check on Tuesday, August 4
Police have not yet confirmed the cause of death of the victims and one of the officers is said to have stepped outside the house after he became sick when he saw the grisly scene on Lake District Lane in Lake Nona
They have, however, admitted the incident was likely a domestic abuse case
Local law enforcement said: At this time, it appears this is a domestic violence-related incident
Investigators worked overnight to gather as much information as possible
As this is still an active and ongoing investigation, no further updates will be provided at this time
It was confirmed a gun was recovered from the scene, but police are still waiting on reports from medical examiners to release more information
The family were killed at the home they had moved into in 2020 and locals have expressed their complete shock over what took place
Nearby residents said they suspected nothing out of the ordinary or anything strange was going on before the killings occurred
Sunny's friends Katelyn Rampersad and Amarie Padovani attended Northlake Park Community School
Both 11, they said she made them feel at home in Florida
Neighbour Heather Collins told WESH: I think it's like a worst nightmare truly
I don't even know what happened exactly
My heart goes out to the family
I can't even begin to wrap my mind around any of this, especially if there were family involved
Justin Rossilini said: They seemed like they were a normal family
I seen the dad, seen the mom, and two little girls
I didn't hear anything, I wish I did
I definitely would have liked to have been that concerned neighbour that did something in this situation
According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 45,222 people died from gun-related injuries in the US in 20202 alone

Nine family members have been found dead after a suspected suicide pact due to financial problems
They have been described as caring and animal loving by locals A 15-year-old girl was among nine members of a caring and animal loving family who have been found dead in what appears to have been a suicide pact over financial debts
The bodies were found in two separate houses that belonged to two brothers from the family in the Sangli district of Maharashtra, India
Only two cats remain alive at one of the homes with the family described as caring and animal loving by locals with a vet, Dr Manik Vanmore, among the dead
Police believe that the nine people died after consuming poison and that the family was going through financial problems, reported Indian Express
Suicide notes refer to repeated and public harassment that the family suffered from money lenders which was both mental and physical, it is reported
The ages of the family range from a girl aged 15, to a 72-year-old woman
The brothers have been named as Popat Yallapa Vanmore, 52, and Dr Manik Yallapa Vanmore, 49
The seven other bodies were identified as Sangeeta Popat Vanmore, 48, Archana Popat Vanmore, 30, Shubham Popat Vanmore, 28, Rekha Manik Vanmore, 45, Aditya Manik Vanmore, 15, Anita Manik Vanmore, 28, and Akkatai Vanmore, 72
Footage taken at the scene shows the corpses lying inside rooms
They were found by locals who noticed the front doors had not been opened for some time
Sangli's District Superintendent of Police Dixit Kumar Gedam said: Nine dead bodies have been recovered in Mhaisal village of Sangli district, out of which three bodies have been recovered from one house and six dead bodies from the other house
The forensic team is present on the spot
A police investigation is currently under way, with officers registering an unnatural cause of death
The bodies will be sent for autopsies
Fifteen people from the region, who have allegedly lent money to the brothers, have been arrested and the police are searching for 10 more suspects, reported Indian Express
A family friend Ashwini Sawant said that they were a caring family
I literally grew up in their home, he said, All of them were very caring and considered me as one of them
From all the special dishes cooked at their home to all the major events, I have been there
Less than a week ago, I came to their house for a paani-puri party
They were a happy family and loved animals
But I also know that over the past few years, they have been under stress because of debt
But we had never imagined this

Murder victim Stephen Cameron's dad Kenneth Cameron, who had been fighting depression since his wife Toni passed away, took his own life just hours after his dog died The dad of a man stabbed to death by road-rage gangster Kenneth Noye killed himself just hours after his dog died, an inquest has found
Kenneth Cameron, 75, grief-stricken by the murder of Stephen, 21, and the death of wife Toni, 73, downed paracetamol and whisky
The overdose was triggered by the death of his dog
Mr Cameron’s brother, Gary, had spoken to him on the night the pet died
But 24 hours later Gary found Mr Cameron, who lived alone, on the floor of his retirement home flat
He died on March 15 in hospital in Ashford, Kent
A coroner said Mr Cameron had been racked with depression since the 2016 death of retired nurse Toni
He was also haunted by the 2019 release of Noye, 75, 19 years into a life sentence for murdering Stephen on a M25 sliproad in Swanley, Kent
Recording a verdict of suicide, coroner Katrina Hepburn said: Mr Cameron’s mental health had been deteriorating since the death of his wife
He had been particularly hit by the death of his dog
When his brother went to see him he was found unconscious in his flat
Mr Cameron suffered a cardiac shock and had been diagnosed with heart disease, asthma and prostate cancer, the inquest heard
He had a heart attack in 2017 and said he was upset that he had survived it
In a statement to the inquest, consultant Dr Debkuma Pandit said he gathered Mr Cameron’s family together as his condition worsened
Dr Pandit said: His family mentioned that he was depressed for many years and that the death of his dog was the trigger for his suicide attempt
Toni died in 2016 after catching her arm on a bush in the garden and contracting a superbug
Her ashes were interred at Stephen’s grave
Ken said: They were so close in life that it seemed right to put them together in death
The couple had campaigned to keep their son’s killer behind bars
Noye became Britain’s most wanted man when he went on the run after the 1996 murder
Get all the latest news sent to your inbox
Sign up for the free Mirror newsletter It sparked an international manhunt and he was arrested two years later when Stephen’s fiancee, Danielle Cable, helped identify Noye in a Spanish restaurant
In 2020 he was seen at the spot where he stabbed Stephen
Mr Cameron said: It’s like Noye’s walking on Stephen’s grave
I feel sickened he has gone back to the place where he took my son’s life
Noye previously served a 14-year sentence for handling gold bullion from the £26
3million Brink’s-Mat robbery in 1983
Danielle, who was just 17 at the time of the murder, is still under the witness protection scheme

WARNING, DISTURBING CONTENT: Semina Halliwell took her own life after an interview with police and her distraught mum has raised concerns about how her daughter's rape allegation was handled A heartbroken mum who raised concerns about how police handled her daughter's rape allegation has shared a haunting final photo taken days before she took her own life
Semina Halliwell, 12, died after spending four nights in hospital days after a police interview where she was made to feel like an inconvenience
Her grieving mum Rachel wants everyone to see the harrowing last picture of her little girl taken just days before her death last year, the Liverpool Echo reports
The Year 7 pupil from Southport, Merseyside, told police she was raped by an older boy who she said had groomed her over Snapchat
Rachel has now released a photograph of Semina taken in hospital just days before she died, as she raised concerns over how the youngster was treated after coming forward
The parent said Merseyside Police officers investigating the alleged rape made Semina feel like an 'inconvenience' and has complained to the Independent Office for Police Conduct
Rachel reached out to police after Semina broke down and told her about the alleged rape following a severe incident of self-harm
She says she wants the image released today to act as a warning to others on the devastating impact bullying can have on others
Rachel said a detective started talking about all the forms he'd have to fill in and how long it would take him to fill those forms in
The mother's aunt Clare Halliwell says the detective then told Semina: It's your word against his and do you really want this hanging over your head for 18 months, because it wouldn't go to court for 18 months to two years
Rachel says she believes police failed her daughter
Merseyside Police today said it was not appropriate to comment on the issues raised ahead of a planned inquest into Semina's death
A spokesperson for the force said: The matter is currently being considered by the Sefton, Knowsley and St Helens coroner and as such it is not appropriate for Merseyside Police to comment on any of the substantive issues raised at this time, as we would not wish to prejudice the coronial investigation
However, we have, and are, co-operating fully with the coroner in this matter
A spokesperson for the coroners' office also said they were unable to comment on this or any case that is under investigation
The spokesperson added: The date of inquest will be published in due course
Semina's tragic case was raised at a parliamentary committee on June 23, 2021, when Labour MP Apsana Begum asked then-Education Secretary Gavin Williamson what more could be done to help protect children from sexual harassment and abuse
Ms Begum said: I wanted to highlight the case of Semina who was 12 years old who disclosed that she'd been raped, and has committed suicide last week
Following her death, Rachel feared Semina's bullies would gatecrash her funeral
Rachel had initially said everyone is invited to celebrate Semina's short life, but she later received some horrifying messages
Screenshots seen by the publication appeared to show someone who knew Semina telling Rachel they had been told they'd get battered at the funeral if they attended

Police officers were in attendance at the funeral, which went ahead without incident
But less than three months later, Rachel was left devastated after the grave of her 12-year-old daughter was trashed by yobs
In September, a family friend found Semina's grave had been completely desecrated
Rachel told the ECHO: It was covered in bricks and rocks and there was dog mess all over it
It was clearly done on purpose
At the time, Community Inspector Graham Fisher said the force and the community shared the family's shock and revulsion over the desecration of Semina's grave
He said This is the final resting place of a beloved family member, and I can only imagine how upsetting it must have been for their loved ones to find that the grave had been treated in this way
While thankfully no permanent damage has been caused, it will have caused lasting distress to the family
Merseyside Police today confirmed no charges or arrests have been made in relation to the attack on Semina's grave

Get email updates with the day's biggest stories WARNING, DISTURBING CONTENT: Semina Halliwell took her own life after an interview with police and her distraught mum has raised concerns about how her daughter's rape allegation was handled A heartbroken mum who raised concerns about how police handled her daughter's rape allegation has shared a haunting final photo taken days before she took her own life
Semina Halliwell, 12, died after spending four nights in hospital days after a police interview where she was made to feel like an inconvenience
Her grieving mum Rachel wants everyone to see the harrowing last picture of her little girl taken just days before her death last year, the Liverpool Echo reports
The Year 7 pupil from Southport, Merseyside, told police she was raped by an older boy who she said had groomed her over Snapchat
Rachel has now released a photograph of Semina taken in hospital just days before she died, as she raised concerns over how the youngster was treated after coming forward
The parent said Merseyside Police officers investigating the alleged rape made Semina feel like an 'inconvenience' and has complained to the Independent Office for Police Conduct
Rachel reached out to police after Semina broke down and told her about the alleged rape following a severe incident of self-harm
She says she wants the image released today to act as a warning to others on the devastating impact bullying can have on others
Rachel said a detective started talking about all the forms he'd have to fill in and how long it would take him to fill those forms in
The mother's aunt Clare Halliwell says the detective then told Semina: It's your word against his and do you really want this hanging over your head for 18 months, because it wouldn't go to court for 18 months to two years
Rachel says she believes police failed her daughter
Merseyside Police today said it was not appropriate to comment on the issues raised ahead of a planned inquest into Semina's death
A spokesperson for the force said: The matter is currently being considered by the Sefton, Knowsley and St Helens coroner and as such it is not appropriate for Merseyside Police to comment on any of the substantive issues raised at this time, as we would not wish to prejudice the coronial investigation
However, we have, and are, co-operating fully with the coroner in this matter
A spokesperson for the coroners' office also said they were unable to comment on this or any case that is under investigation
The spokesperson added: The date of inquest will be published in due course
Semina's tragic case was raised at a parliamentary committee on June 23, 2021, when Labour MP Apsana Begum asked then-Education Secretary Gavin Williamson what more could be done to help protect children from sexual harassment and abuse
Ms Begum said: I wanted to highlight the case of Semina who was 12 years old who disclosed that she'd been raped, and has committed suicide last week
Following her death, Rachel feared Semina's bullies would gatecrash her funeral
Rachel had initially said everyone is invited to celebrate Semina's short life, but she later received some horrifying messages
Screenshots seen by the publication appeared to show someone who knew Semina telling Rachel they had been told they'd get battered at the funeral if they attended

Ian Chapman called the police after greeting a young man on a Lancashire bridge as he walked past with his dog and realising he was looking straight through him A passerby prevented a young man from taking his own life after spotting an eerie clue in his face
Ian Chapman, from Padiham, Lancashire, was walking over a bridge as he crossed paths with the stranger but after saying hello he realised there was something off
The 61-year-old noticed an absence of emotion in the man's eyes, as though he was looking straight through him
He realised he was going to take his own life and called the police, reports LancsLive
Ian said: I was walking past this gentleman who didn't reply to me
When I said hello and I turned around and he was climbing over the edge of the bridge
I offered him my phone, to see if there was anyone he wanted to ring
Then I thought, what am I doing? He could have just lost a family member and that could be really triggering for him
So, I turned away and called the police
Have you been affected by this story? Let us know at webnews@mirror. co
uk By the time Ian got to the end of the bridge, the police had already arrived
However, the dad-of-two didn't want to stay at the scene much longer and set off home
Ian said: I was just walking and my dog scared this lady who was tending to her garden
She saw me crying and asked if I was OK and if I wanted to come into her house
I just told her that I needed to get back home to my wife and I explained what had just happened
Her house was next door to a halfway house type place, so she came to tell me later on that the man had been saved
Although the gentleman was saved, Ian has no further update about him
The experience has stuck with him and a year on, Ian recognises that charities, particularly local ones, rely on funding which they often have to fight hard to get
Now, off the back of the incident he witnessed and his previous love of fundraising, Ian will be doing a walk, completely barefooted from Burnley to Bacup - a total of seven miles
Burnley born and bred, Ian decided he wanted to do the barefoot walk after brainstorming words that begin with the letter B, choosing the starting point, destination and how he'd go about it
His love for raising money came after the coronavirus pandemic which saw employees at his work laid of for one week every month
He said: Since April this year, one week a month we get laid off due to a shortage in the supply chain
So, I decided I needed another focus and I was thinking, what can I do? I was contemplating things beginning with a B for Burnley and it went from there, my wife thinks I'm off my head
Ian will be raising money for Casual Minds Matter CIC, a Burnley based charity that help to provide professional support and counselling to men who are struggling with their mental health
I've never really seen anyone who's had to battle with depression or alcohol or drug abuse or anything like that, Ian continued
It's just never really been something that the people around me have suffered with
What is happening where you live? Find out by adding your postcode
I obviously knew people were living with it but I didn't fully appreciate to what degree people lived with it
When I do my walks, I carry my trainers with me and it's like a safety net if I decide I want to give up
People that are suffering don't always have those safety nets though and that's why I'm raising money for the charity
I just want to make people aware that if you need help, there's always someone just a phone call away
Ian has been gearing himself up for his walk, which will take place on Saturday, August 20 from St
Catherine's Community Centre to the Cornerstones pub in Bacup

David Marsden, 22, was said to 'light up the darkest rooms' by his sister but the young man tragically took his own life after struggling with insomnia which began when a family holiday was cut short A young man who lit up the darkest rooms took his own life after he fell into a mental health spiral during struggles with insomnia
David Marsden first began suffering with the condition when a family holiday in 2019 was cut short
But following that the 22-year-old fell into a vicious cycle of becoming increasingly anxious at his normal life slipping away as his insomnia took over, the Manchester Evening News reports
The lab worker at Stepping Hill hospital suffered episodes of depression and anxiety and spent time on a psychiatric ward in the hospital where he worked
However, on November 21, 2019, months after the family holiday that was cut short, he was found dead in his family home in Stockport
His death triggered PTSD and insomnia in his older sister Charlene Marsden who has since opened up about his death
David's death turned the world of his sister, 33-year-old Charlene Marsden, and she said they had been like twins
She continued: We shared the same interests, the gym, Game of Thrones, all sorts of things
We would literally do everything together, and watch all the shows and movies together
He was literally my best friend
He was loved by so many people
And it's sad because my brother was the person who all his friends, family, and colleagues, including myself, would go to for advice and help when we were feeling low
He knew exactly what to say
His smile would light up the darkest of rooms, but unfortunately, when he found himself in a dark place there was just no way of getting him out of it
I don't think there's a lot of awareness of sibling grief and what it does to you, Charlene added
She said: They are the ones you think will be there when your parents pass
They are your past, your present, and your future so when you lose them at such a young age it's just so tragic and upsetting
I think I'll be dealing with this for the rest of my life
I probably cry most days about him to be fair
There will always be something that will remind you and you'll suddenly be in tears
But it's something I guess you learn to live with as hard as that sounds
You carry it around with you, and after a while, it gets lighter, but it's always there
Charlene struggled so much that she said she suffered from PTSD and her own bout of insomnia
She said: Last year before the inquest it happened to me
I can't even put into words what it was like
But I understood completely what he must have been going through
I had to have three months off work as my mum was terrified it was going to happen to me
I think it was just to do with the grief and the mental issues it had caused
I went three weeks without sleeping.  It was horrendous
Once you get up having not slept all night you become terrified of the evening that's coming next because you think 'am I going to lie there awake all night again
' Your appetite completely goes and you feel sick
You're running on empty, you're like a zombie
I had hypnotherapy, counselling, the lot
But I'm just pushing through as for me it's like I owe it to my brother
Just to show him that I can do it
Obviously it destroyed my brother and I'm not going to let it destroy me
I'm proving it to him, that it doesn't matter how bad things get, you can push through it
Charlene and her and David’s mum, Fiona Marsden, have set up a local support group for those bereaved by suicide
They hold monthly meetings and have now decided they are all going to climb Snowdon to raise funds for four charities close to their hearts
David’s much-loved niece 13-year-old Chantae is also taking part and his cousin Adrian, a former Royal Marine, is acting as a guide and support during the climb
Charlene said: We just want to spread awareness and raise as much as we can for these charities and I think that funding is vital at the minute as demand has gone up massively and there just isn't enough funding there
The climb will be a challenge but also really symbolic as I'm still climbing a mountain with my grief
But I truly believe it's helping
That's why it means so much to all of us
Charlene intends to sprinkle some of her brother's ashes at the summit
I know the views will be beautiful and he loved nature, she said
I am in awe of all the members
I'm in my thirties but several of them are older and have health issues
But we'll just take it at the pace of the slowest climber and if we reach the top we've done our bit for those who need our help the most
With mental health being paramount I go through life now with the motto 'in a world where you can be anything, be kind
' One small act of kindness could save a life and that's what will be driving us on the day

Friends of Mehlika Derici watched in horror as her boyfriend clasped his arms round her waist and flung himself from the cliff in Turkey, dragging her with him to their deaths The chilling final words of a jealous boyfriend who threw himself off a cliff, dragging his beautiful girlfriend with him have been revealed by horrified witnesses
Police are investigating the suspected murder-suicide after the couple fell 82ft to their deaths, in Marmara Ereglisi, Tekirdag Province, Turkey, on August 6
Landowner, Selcuk Cetiner, 41, and beautician Mehlika Derici, 35, had been enjoying a meal with another couple to celebrate their friend's birthday, just hours before the tragic incident
After the meal the pair had gone with the other couple to a nearby lookout point known as Asiklar Tepesi, or Lovers' Hill
But a row broke out between them and Cetiner pushed Mehlika to the ground before friend, Merve Y, 32, and her boyfriend, Arda Tolunay Y, 26, picked her back up
Merve and her boyfriend Arda claim they heard Cetiner then shout if we die, we die together as clasped his arms round Mehlika's waist and dragged her over the edge, before she had time to react
Paramedics were called to the scene but were only able to declare them dead
The group had been drinking in the restaurant and had carried on at the viewpoint
The couple's bodies were taken to the morgue at Marmara Ereglisi Public Hospital, while police seized their mobile phones for analysis

Daryl McWilliam, 24, was found dead in his hotel room after drunkenly texting his girlfriend of 12 months that he didn't want to 'be with her anymore' An amazing 24-year-old dad took his own life after splitting up with his girlfriend during a weekend away in Blackpool
An inquest heard Daryl McWilliam had travelled to the seaside resort with his girlfriend of 12 months, Natalie Jones
The couple, from Kilmarnock, Scotland, visited Wetherspoons for something to eat before returning to their room at Garvey's Promenade Hotel on Saturday February 26
The pair then decided to go back out and visit three pubs in Blackpool town centre, Lancs Live reports
Towards the end of the night, it is reported that Daryl, 24, became increasingly intoxicated and, after becoming separated from Natalie, he sent her a text saying: I don't want to be with you anymore
Shocked at this, Natalie then made several attempts to contact Daryl who eventually returned to the hotel at around midnight
The couple had an argument, during which Daryl damaged Natalie's phone and other belongings in the room, before she started to pack her things into their car
When Natalie went back to the room, Daryl wasn't there, and so she went downstairs to the bar to look for him
A short while later Natalie went back up to the room where she found Daryl unconscious
Paramedics and police were called but despite extensive resuscitation efforts Daryl was pronounced dead at 1. 37am on February 27
The cause of death was given as hanging
An inquest at Blackpool Town Hall today (Tuesday July 19) heard that Daryl, a pipe-fitter at Kilmaurs engineering firm A&L Mechanical Installations, had no history of mental health issues
He had visited the GP with his mum in 2020 for help with low mood but he was not known to the community mental health team
The content of the messages sent by Daryl indicate he was intoxicated
This tragic incident would appear to have stemmed from the breakdown of the relationship on a night which involved alcohol consumption
Assistant Coroner Louise Rae returned a conclusion of suicide
She said: Daryl McWilliam was on holiday in Blackpool with his partner
Following an argument she returned to the room to find him hanging
He was not known to mental health services
I agree this was a tragic incident which stemmed from the breakdown of a relationship
In terms of the evidence. .
I don't believe anybody could have acted sooner
It is difficult to find any conclusion other than suicide. .
I am therefore satisfied that the only conclusion possible and the one that I reach is the short-form conclusion of suicide
A fundraiser launched after Daryl's death, to help his parents Heather and John pay for the funeral, raised more than £2,200
Daryl's girlfriend Natalie paid tribute to him after his death, as reported by the Daily Record, in which she described him as the most amazing person she had ever known
She added: You showed me what true love actually is
I will always love you Daryl
I really wish I had gotten more time with you and got to do everything we planned on
You never failed to make me smile whenever I felt down and I can’t thank you enough for how happy you made me

Nick Phillips, 39, was working the night shift on Tuesday, August 30, when he was alerted by a member of staff that a woman had reportedly locked herself in the toilets in the Winter Gardens in an apparent attempt to take her own life and was unresponsive An ex-army man turned Morrisons manager saved a woman's life inside the store toilets
Nick Phillips, 39, was working the night shift on Tuesday, August 30, at the Southport branch when he was alerted by a member of staff that something serious had happened
A woman had reportedly locked herself in the toilets in the Winter Gardens in an apparent attempt to take her own life and was unresponsive
After knocking on the door, Mr Phillips broke down the door to get to the woman
He performed emergency CPR on the woman and she began breathing again, reports the Liverpool Echo
Both the police and ambulance services were called, and the woman was taken to hospital where she would receive further treatment
As an ex-army and former prison officer, Mr Phillips knew exactly what to do
His previous training meant that he knew compact CPR, and he has a history of tending to people in need
His wife, Catherine Phillips, said: Because of his experience, his brain goes into this mode where he does exactly what he needs to do to get stuff done, I’ve never known anyone like him
He gets the job done, so when this happened, I don’t know who the girl is, but she couldn't have wished for anyone better to come and save her life
He is the most resilient person I’ve ever met in my life
Catherine said her husband stayed on shift for hours after the incident to ensure that his staff were okay and felt supported
A spokesperson for North West Ambulance Service said: I can confirm an ambulance attended and took a patient to hospital

Craig Murray was found dead at Etherow Country Park in Stockport two years ago but his wife Jade believes he should have received better support from mental health services A heartbroken wife has shared her grief after her husband killed himself in the same park where he had proposed to her
Craig Murray had asked his wife Jade to marry him at Etherow Country Park in Stockport, where he was found dead in 2020
The 41-year-old, who had a long history of mental health problems, had only been married for 18 months when he died
Craig had been working as a car salesman at a local dealership prior to his death on May 23, 2020
Two years on Jade, 39, says she is still struggling to come to terms with what happened
She hopes that by sharing her story, mental health services can provide better for those that are struggling
Jade said in quotes reported by the Manchester Evening News : It’s more than two years since I lost Craig and it’s still incredibly difficult to come to terms with the fact he’s no longer here
We had only been married 18 months when he died
Craig’s mental illness was putting a strain on our relationship, but I believe that with the correct treatment Craig would have recovered and we would have spent the rest of our lives together
It devastates me that this won’t happen
Craig had suffered from mental illness since 2013 and in 2019 his health deteriorated again when he developed psychosis and paranoia, as well as delusions and low mood
He was placed under the care of Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust's Access Team and Community Health Team (CMHT), before being referred to the Home Treatment Team in January 2020
He remained under the care of the CMHT and HMT until his death four months later
During this time, he took a number of overdoses
Jade, a bank business manager, said: When his mental health began to deteriorate, he began thinking he was in danger and that people were following him
He moved in with his mum just before lockdown as he kept saying he thought I was also in danger and that our home security was being hacked
It was awful and I kept pleading with him not to do anything stupid
To this day, I still have so many questions over Craig’s death and whether more could have been done to help him
I hope that by sharing my story it will highlight the devastating effects that the lack of appropriate support for loved ones with mental health problems can have
After an inquest in December 2020 highlighted issues in the care provided to Craig, his widow instructed medical negligence experts at Irwin Mitchell to investigate her husband’s care under the Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust
She is joining with her legal team marked World Suicide Prevention Day this month by speaking out on her loss and to help raise awareness around mental illness

Margaret Ryan, the specialist medical negligence lawyer at Irwin Mitchell representing Jade, said: Craig’s family remain devastated by what’s happened and his son, who was 15 years old at the time, is now without a father
Sadly, the inquest into Craig’s death highlighted issues in the care provided to him in the lead up to his death
We’re now investigating this and will continue to support Jade however we can
Clare Parker, director of nursing, healthcare professionals and quality governance at Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust, said: Our deepest sympathies are with Craig Murray’s family
Our own investigation supported the findings of the coroner
The Covid pandemic meant that we had to rapidly change the way our teams worked and we accepted that a lack of face-to-face contact was a missed opportunity to reassess Mr Murray
We are very sorry this did not happen
World Suicide Prevention Day was on 10 September

Pictures of Steffan Rees are not what people expect to see after he took his own life
They show pure joy and happiness as he teaches his baby niece a joyful song The final images of a man before his life ended are what his family want everyone to see
Pictures of Steffan Rees are not what people expect to see after he took his own life
They show pure joy and happiness as he teaches his baby niece If You Are Happy And You Know It
Stefan's sister Sian, from Cardigan, Wales, says her brother was the life and soul of the party and the kind of person who lit up the room when he arrived
Wales On line reports it is why his suicide was such a shock and drives his devastated sister to help others
She said: I couldn't have asked for a better brother
He was only 26, had a loving family, a beautiful girlfriend, and didn't say anything about having any mental health issues
Since his death Sian has tried to find positives
Together with widows Lisa and Ana, who have also been bereaved through suicide, they have set up a support group and taken part in a UK awareness campaign
New research from suicide prevention charity Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) has found that 61% of people would struggle to tell if someone they knew felt suicidal
The charity wants to raise awareness that the ‘face of suicide’ isn’t always crying and being recluse
A person might seem happy on the outside, and to illustrate this, the charity has unveiled an exhibition on London’s Southbank called 'The Last Photo'
The outdoor gallery displays 50 smiling photos taken in the last days of people who died by suicide
It also shares the stories of shock and grief their families and friends experienced
A photograph of Steffan forms part of the moving exhibition, as do the pictures of Peter Hammett, from Swansea, and Lee, from Tenby
Along with Sian, Peter's wife Lisa and Lee's wife Ana have set up a support group - LISS - Living in Suicide Shadow because they felt there was a lack of support for those bereaved by suicide
Ana said: We are a peer-to-peer support group that aims to break the 'isolation' that we often find ourselves in by organising face to face and virtual meet ups, walks, family activities with people that understand the pain of suicide
The latest figures show that 125 people die by suicide every week in the UK, but it can be hard to spot the signs something isn’t okay Just months after Ana's husband died of suicide another CALM's project called 84, which represented the number of people who died every week in the UK in 2018, was launched
Ana, whose children were nine and six when her husband died, said: The 84 project floored me
It had such a powerful message; I couldn't believe 84 men took their lives every week… so many families, friends, and communities heartbroken
Suddenly, my husband's individual act was not so individual anymore
If the suicide average was constant, how can we blame such rates of suicide on one individual's reckless decision? It felt much more like a social issue, and if it was the case, then we could do something about it
Talking about this campaign she said: I will never forget those beautiful smiles of those beautiful people… beautiful children, beautiful women, handsome men, different ages, different genders, different social classes, different ethnicities, proof that suicide can happen to anyone
The shadows of the leaves moving with the wind and the sun created movement in the photos
I kept looking and hoping that they would start moving
And even though it was so comforting to see a life-size picture, I found it so hard to leave the exhibition; I wanted to bring him home with me, we miss Lee so much! The picture of Lee, who was 41 when he died, was taken in Castell Henllys, Pembrokeshire, on a wonderful day out with friends
There were Roman attacks, and Celtic victories, plenty of laughter and at one point Lee had all the kids shoeless crossing the stream in the cold April
Never in a million years would any of us believe that he would be gone less than a couple of months later
Our children were only six and nine when he died
He loved them to bits and was always with them
They would say 'but daddy was always happy with he was with me'
It was not long after Lee's death that Ana met Lisa, through Dr Dai Lloyd, an MS who has been heavily involved in suicide prevention campaigns
Ana added: Things have moved on a lot in recent years, but there is a lot of stigma around suicide
People would say things like he is your husband, you live with him, how did you not see it, some people blame you for it, others don't know what to say
It is said that we lose around 70% of our circle of family and friends as it is difficult for people to understand and support our grief
Being able to talk with other people who have been through the same experience has helped
The group has helped the three form a close bond
We have been on a journey together the last couple of years and it seemed fitting that we should all be taking part in The Last Photo campaign and supporting each other, she said
The exhibition was held on the Southbank somewhere I'd previously visited with my family including Peter with such happy memories
My immediate reaction when I saw the life size photo of Peter was to cry
I placed my hand upon his face in disbelief remembering this photo I had taken on our 33rd wedding anniversary just three months before he died
She added: When Peter died I was determined to make a stand against the stigma associated with suicide and for his death not to be in vein I'm so proud we all took part in CALMs The Last Photo campaign
We hope all our stories make a difference and ultimately save lives

Ana added: Things have moved on a lot in recent years, but there is a lot of stigma around suicide
People would say things like he is your husband, you live with him, how did you not see it, some people blame you for it, others don't know what to say
It is said that we lose around 70% of our circle of family and friends as it is difficult for people to understand and support our grief
Being able to talk with other people who have been through the same experience has helped
The group has helped the three form a close bond
We have been on a journey together the last couple of years and it seemed fitting that we should all be taking part in The Last Photo campaign and supporting each other, she said
The exhibition was held on the Southbank somewhere I'd previously visited with my family including Peter with such happy memories
My immediate reaction when I saw the life size photo of Peter was to cry
I placed my hand upon his face in disbelief remembering this photo I had taken on our 33rd wedding anniversary just three months before he died
She added: When Peter died I was determined to make a stand against the stigma associated with suicide and for his death not to be in vein I'm so proud we all took part in CALMs The Last Photo campaign
We hope all our stories make a difference and ultimately save lives

Matt Lloyd, 54, spent six weeks in ICU and on a burns unit at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, undergoing total of four operations following the self-harming incident last August A dad suffered 70% full body burns as a result of self-harming
Matt Lloyd had suffered a breakdown in a 12-year relationship at the time of the incident - and has thanked hospital staff for saving his life
The 54-year-old was rushed to Glasgow Royal Infirmary last August before spending six weeks in intensive care and then being transferred to the burns unit
He underwent a total of four operations, reports the Daily Record
The first thing he remembers on waking up was asking to speak to his two sons, and admits he feels guilty about what he put them through
Speaking about the heroic medical staff who treated him, Matt said: I really believe that without their help, I wouldn’t be here
They saved me and gave me back to my sons
With 60-70 per cent full-body burns, doctors operated quickly to save Matt’s life and prevent further damage to his muscles
He told his sons and the rest of the family he was in a desperate place prior to the incident
He said: I felt so guilty about what I had put them (his sons) through and explained to them and my family that I didn’t do it because I didn’t love them
I just didn’t love myself at that time
During his time on the burns unit Matt was looked after by physiotherapists, occupational therapists and healthcare support workers, as well as mental health teams who address the impacts of the trauma

Catriona Murray, a senior physiotherapist on the unit, said: A burn injury is often a life-changing injury, not just for the patient, but for their family too
We come together as a team, to help encourage functional tasks, our goal is to help get people back to functioning as they were before their injury
Thanking the nursing team, Matt said: I really believe that without their help, I wouldn’t be here

Billie Charity hit rock-bottom following the tragic death of her brother Stan
Here, the 47-year-old explains how focusing on her passion for photography helped her grieve and build a new life My most precious memories of my younger brother Stan are of us as kids
He was happy, beautiful and the sweetest boy in the world.  I adored him
We’d spend hours playing Lego and Monopoly together, and remained close into adulthood
I hold these memories close now – the boy he was and the relationship we had before his mental illness took hold in his thirties
Our parents separated when we were little
My dad would travel to an off-grid cottage in a remote valley near our home in Herefordshire to spend time with us
He was a fashion photographer and I still treasure the pictures he took of those sunny days
My mum also took wonderful photos of us, capturing family Christmases and our amazing garden, which she filled with sunflowers one year
Photography was a huge passion for the whole family
When Stan and I grew up, we lived together in London
I loved working at the BBC Learning department doing PR
But Stan never seemed happy and he returned to Herefordshire to live with Mum
I took photos all the time and my now-husband Dave and I would always take our cameras out at weekends
After a few visits back to Herefordshire, Dave fell in love with the area
He got on really well with Stan, which made me happy
I was feeling broody and the countryside felt like a better option, so we moved back and lived with Mum and my brother for a couple of years
I remember that time fondly
We ate together every night and took turns to cook
We played board games and pool, watched family TV favourites
Most importantly, we talked and reminisced
Some time later, unbeknown to any of us, my brother developed a serious mental illness
I’d had my first daughter and was suffering postnatal depression
Mum was also diagnosed with MS – things were pretty heavy
Me and Stan grew apart
I had another daughter shortly afterwards
I know Stan loved them both but I couldn’t understand why he appeared to have little interest in them and I resented this
He once told them they could have his old car as a play den
He once played pool with them, once bounced on the trampoline with them, once invited them to watch Scooby-Doo
But these gestures were few and far between
It became normal that Stan wasn’t very present in our lives
He never opened up to me about his mental illness and his unbearable suffering
Instead, it came out as anger and him not being very nice
Seeing him became deeply upsetting
I desperately missed my brother, my best friend, my confidant
Then, on Easter Sunday 2016, after several years of barely any communication, Stan turned up at my front door.  I was thrilled
We went for a walk but it soon became obvious something was really wrong
He was finally opening up but he was incredibly paranoid
I was happy that he was talking to me again – I was getting my brother back – but I was worried about him
He said he was very anxious and low, and felt something really bad was going to happen but he didn’t know what
I urged him to see a doctor but he convinced me everything was OK
The next weekend, there was a knock on the door in the middle of the night.  It was the police
Stan’s body had been found
He’d taken his life in the cottage where my dad used to take us as children
What happened next is a total blur
The type of grief that comes from sibling suicide is incredibly complex, especially when you’d been as close as Stan and I were
It’s like something outside of you that you have no control of
It hits you over and over, like a tidal wave
Eventually, I found others online who helped me understand what I was going through
Soon after Stan died, Dave and I moved with our daughters (then aged six and nine) back into Mum’s house
Initially, it was hard because there were signs of Stan everywhere
Each anniversary without him – every birthday, Christmas and Easter – brought further tidal waves of grief and I’d spend days in bed
Then, I rediscovered my camera
I had a strong urge to get far away from Herefordshire and took my eldest daughter to Hong Kong to stay with a cousin
I found solace taking photos of the amazing people and places we saw
Back home, photography became one of the ways I learned to live with my grief
A psychotherapist saw the link between my photography and my recovery
I looked up to Stan as a talented photographer – one of our last conversations was about photography
Two days before he died, he said he was happy and proud that I was pursuing my passion – and gave me his camera
Looking back, he obviously knew he wouldn’t be around for much longer.  He was saying goodbye
Six years after Stan’s death, I’m learning to live with the pain
But out of nowhere I can still get a sudden, sharp stabbing in the stomach that’s so powerful I can’t breathe
My physically healthy, handsome, intelligent, sweet, loved and loving brother is dead
And he died by his own hand
Did he realise that he’d never get to drive his beloved Alfa Romeo again, or play pool, or walk up his favourite mountain, or eat bacon sandwiches, sit in the sunshine? I’ll never see him again or hear his voice
Nor will I ever hug him and tell him he was one of the most significant and loved people in my life
Over the years, different emotions have crashed in and out; anger, guilt, hurt, sadness, confusion.  It’s overwhelming
But when Stan died, I suddenly saw life as extremely precious and short
I became fearless and threw myself into my photography
I’m now working full-time as a freelance photographer, have co-run a gallery and published three books
I’m living life for myself – but also for Stan
He’s always, always with me

WARNING DISTRESSING CONTENT Eve Lewis, 15, was a popular and bright student but had struggled with anorexia in the latter part of 2020 in her quest for perfection A teenage girl who dreamed of becoming a lawyer went out for a walk with her dog but sadly never returned
Eve Lewis, 15, was hit by a train after going for a wander with her pet instead of out with her family on September 26 last year
The Lancashire schoolgirl dreamed of becoming a lawyer and was predicted top grades in her GCSEs
A popular pupil, Eve's family say she tried her best in everything and had recently discovered a new passion for both art and drama
They were not worried when she told them she would head out to walk the dog instead of joining them on a trip out last year and, while she battled anorexia, at times becoming painfully thin, relatives thought that she was over the worst of it and had her spark back
There was nothing to suggest that when she went out to walk the dog that day, that she wouldn't be coming home again, her family told LancsLive
There were no cries for help
Eve had so many things to look forward to and so many plans for the future
We don’t believe Eve wanted to die; she wanted to put an end to the torment she was in.  That torment was anorexia
Eve died after being hit by a train and her dog was later found running free in a nearby field by a passer-by
The talented youngster, who was in her final year at Burscough Priory Academy, had developed the eating disorder in the latter part of 2020 in her quest for perfection
Her mum Paula noticed she had lost a considerable amount of weight but, initially, Eve still appeared to be eating normal meals at home in Burscough
However, as 2021 started, and Eve was forced to home-school because of lockdown, she became obsessed with her food intake
By the Easter holidays she wouldn't even allow herself to enjoy the Sunday lunch her mum had made and her weight plummeted to less than six stone
By April 2021 mum Paula, a retired police officer, had become so concerned that she took Eve to see the GP who recorded her weight as just 37kg, or five stone eight pounds
The following day she was called by the eating disorder clinic who advised Eve's parents to not allow her to eat low fat food but after that she just refused to eat at all, her mum said
At an inquest at Preston Coroner's Court today, Paula said: We were told to persevere and we would spend hours every day trying to get her to eat
She would be crying, I would be crying and it was absolutely horrendous
It got to the stage where she was terrified of food
She would hold a fork up to her mouth and her hand would be shaking
In May 2021, as Eve's physical condition deteriorated and she became painfully thin, she attended an appointment with the eating disorder service's practitioners and a GP
The doctor was so worried about Eve's low heart rate, caused by starvation, that he sent her to A&E with her family advised to pack a bag as it was likely she would be admitted
Dr Johnstone told the inquest: I was particularly struck by the terrific efforts of mum and dad who had done everything to try and help her
They spoke of spending six hours a day trying to get her to eat
It was a very clear decision to admit her to hospital because despite all of that she was becoming more and more unwell
When she was admitted to Southport and Ormskirk District General Hospital, 15-year-old Eve weighed 36
55kg - five and a half stone
She was only allowed out of bed in a wheelchair because of her frailty and she told medics that she was worried she would lose control in hospital and become fat
She still had a sense of humour though, mum Paula told the inquest
I remember at one point they asked if she had any allergies and she said 'oil, fat, butter, sugar. . . . ' and was joking
After being warned that she would have to have a nasal feeding tube inserted if she continued to refuse food, Eve slowly began to eat while in hospital
By the time she was discharged, four weeks later, she had gained over 5kg
By September Eve, who was born in Ormskirk, had managed to gain more weight and she was deemed well enough to return to school
She asked her mum if she could have highlights put in her hair and her eyebrows tinted so that if anyone says I look different I can say that's why, Eve told Paula
Headteacher Lucy MacLaren described Eve as a beautiful girl' who loved netball and who contributed in every way possible to the school
See what’s happening near you by entering your postcode below or visit InYourArea The bright student, who could recite Pi to 40 digits, was part of a lovely group of friends who were very supportive
Eve was desperate to get better and had written a list of fear foods such as Ben & Jerry's ice cream and McDonald's, which she and her mum were ticking off one-by-one as she managed to try them
On the morning of Sunday September 26, the family were due to go out but Eve had stayed at home because she was worried a food situation would present itself and she would feel embarrassed
At lunchtime, Eve took the family dog out for a walk near to the train line close to their home in Ainscough Drive and spent 20 minutes talking to a friend on the phone
Emergency services raced to the scene shortly after 1. 35pm
Hayley Bevan was walking over the same trainline crossing and spotted a dog's lead and dog poo bags placed on the ground
She then walked on and saw the Lewis family dog running free

Just before Eve ran across the tracks she posted a heartbreaking message to her friends on Snapchat in which she thanked them for their support, the inquest heard
Assistant Coroner Laura Nash, who cried as she summarised the evidence, returned a conclusion of suicide
She also requested to see the family after the inquest to speak to them privately
After the inquest, Eve's family said in a statement that she had been tormented by anorexia
They said: Eve was just 15 years, one month and eight days’ old when her life ended
All of the superlatives we could come up with would still not do her justice
She was the most caring, loving, funny little girl who was an absolute pleasure to be around
She brought joy into the lives of everyone lucky enough to know her.  Eve was a perfectionist
She did everything to the best of her ability
She should have been taking her GCSEs this year and her grades were predicted to be 8s and 9s
She wanted to be a lawyer
Eve loved sports and exercise, and she was especially good at gymnastics
She enjoyed drama too, and had recently discovered that she was a talented artist
She had a great network of friends and was very popular at school
Unfortunately, in her quest to be perfect, she became anorexic
She was receiving treatment and improving daily
We thought that she was over the worst of it and had her spark back
There was nothing to suggest that when she went out to walk the dog that day, that she wouldn't be coming home again
There were no cries for help
Eve had so many things to look forward to and so many plans for the future
We don’t believe Eve wanted to die; she wanted to put an end to the torment she was in.  That torment was anorexia
Looking back, we believe that as Eve reached a normal weight range, rather than having her appointments with the eating disorder clinic reduced to once a month, she should have continued to be seen and given the opportunity for counselling without a parent present
Medication should also have been considered to help Eve’s mind cope with the changes, as we were told the brain is the last to recover
What is going wrong in our society that makes children and young adults feel they aren't good enough? They are
We wish Eve knew how wonderful she was
She was loved so much, by so many
We believe that Eve didn't tell us how she was feeling as she didn't want to worry or upset us
In her right frame of mind, she would never, ever have done anything to hurt any of us
We wish things could be different
We wish that we could have saved her

We believe that Eve didn't tell us how she was feeling as she didn't want to worry or upset us
In her right frame of mind, she would never, ever have done anything to hurt any of us
We wish things could be different
We wish that we could have saved her

Suzanne Drinkwater woke up in summer last year to find her boyfriend dead in the bed beside her and she decided to take her own life- the couple's bodies would eventually be found there A woman tragically killed herself after waking up to find her boyfriend dead in their bed beside her
Suzanne Drinkwater woke up one morning in the summer last year and was horrified when she found her boyfriend 35-year-old Gavin Massey, was dead next to her
The heartbroken 32-year-old from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, took her own life that morning in the very same bed
When the couple were finally found after police bashed down their front door, one of the bodies was decomposing
She had been receiving help for a number of psychiatric conditions at the time of her death, the inquest into their deaths heard
Coroner Tom Osborne, sitting at Milton Keynes, heard how Gavin likely died from cardiomegaly, an enlarged heart, and left ventricular hypertrophy, worsened by the steroids he had been taking
His death was also exacerbated by a mixture of alcohol and drugs found in his system
The alarm was raised after Suzanne’s sister had been unable to contact her from August 4, and on August 7, she raised her fears with police
One day after that, they discovered the couple dead after police were forced to break into their home
There was no criticism of the agencies which had been helping both patients, during the joint inquest

Chloe Barber, of Driffield, East Yorkshire, was bullied at school, self-harmed and eventually took her own life at home in November last year
Her mum has shared her grief A devastated mother has shared her grief after her teenage daughter was found hanged at the family home
Kirsten Barber said Chloe Barber, 18, fell through the cracks of the mental health system after several stays in psychiatric hospitals
Her brother Reece Barber, 15, discovered Chloe unresponsive and, though her called 999 and gave Chloe CPR, the teenager was pronounced dead at the home in Driffield, East Yorkshire
Speaking today, grief-stricken Kirsten said Chloe struggled after being diagnosed with unstable personality disorder
She told Hull Live : You know when people say they’re heartbroken? This is heartbroken
When you split up with your boyfriend and stuff like that you think you know heartbreak.  But this is heartbreak
Anyone who is able to can donate to Kirsten's JustGiving page for their Three Peaks challenge for Chloe here
There are times when I just want to tell Chloe something, like when our dogs have done something daft and then you remember you can’t
But I know she’s still here
I had Covid last month and the worst thing about it was losing my sense of smell
I went into her bedroom because I just go in there every so often to be near her, and I couldn’t smell her
The family had first noticed signs Chloe was struggling in 2017 when she was a victim of bullying at school
She also self-harmed as her condition deteriorated over the following years
On one occasion, Chloe didn't return to Mill Lodge Hospital in York after going for a walk
And in early 2021, the teenager was hospitalised at Cygnet Health Care where her problems with self harm became worse
It was at Cygnet where she also met friend Chelsea Blue Mooney, a teenager from Bridlington, North Yorkshire, who shortly later died while in the unit's care
Chloe was left devastated by 17-year-old Chelsea’s death in April last year
Kirsten continued: Mental health is an invisible killer
If someone’s got cancer or a broken leg you can physically see it and you can physically mend it
We still don’t know exactly what Chloe was going through
She was a very secretive person
Chloe took her own life in November last year
Kirsten is taking on the Yorkshire Three Peaks later this spring to raise cash for young suicide charity Papyrus
Figures released by the Office of National Statistics (ONS) this week show 587 people in Yorkshire & the Humber took their lives in 2021 - of which 419 were men or boys and 168 women or girls
Data suggests suicide figures did not rise during the pandemic, although have slowly risen over the past 10 years
And while suicide remains the biggest killer of young men, the number of female suicides has been insidiously creeping up in recent years
Papyrus supports young people affected by suicide and suicidal thoughts, and has seen a 25% increase in calls, texts and emails to its confidential HOPELINEUK service
In 2020 and 2021 at least one in every three contacts was from a child under the age of 18
Anyone who is able to can donate to Kirsten's JustGiving page for their Three Peaks challenge for Chloe here
A spokesperson from Humber Teaching NHS Foundation Trust, said: It is the position of the Trust that we do not comment on individual cases, as we prefer to discuss directly with the families who are affected

David Hunter is charged with murdering his wife of 52 years Janice in December, but insists it was her wish to die
Now, he has told his daughter he wants to kill himself Retired coal miner David Hunter told his daughter he would kill himself at the first opportunity after failing in a suicide pact with his terminally ill wife in Cyprus
David, 74, is charged with murdering his wife of 52 years Janice in December, but insists it was her wish to die
He is alleged to have suffocated leukaemia-stricken Janice before taking an overdose of prescription pills, however he was found and survived
Daughter Lesley Cawthorne, 49, who is supporting her dad, has revealed his agony as he faces a life sentence unless the charge is reduced to assisted dying
Speaking to her from jail in Cypriot capital Nicosia, he told her last week: I do not know how to live without her
I’m Janice’s husband, and without her, I don’t really know who I am
David, a miner for 40 years in his native Northumberland before the pair moved to retire in Cyprus, says he acted out of love for 75-year-old Janice
Janice had begged David for him to end her pain, Lesley says
When Lesley first spoke to him after events in December – in a tearful call as he lay in a Paphos hospital – he told her: I’m so sorry, I love you, but I want to be with your mum
I’m so sorry but as soon as I get a chance, I will kill myself
Lesley begged him not to, saying she could not lose them both
There are people out there doing bad things, she says
All my dad did was love someone
Janice was diagnosed with blood cancer in 2016, and both she and David had endured heartbreak in the late 1980s that influenced their decision more than 30 years later, Lesley said
Janice’s sister Kath died of leukaemia and Janice had vowed not to endure the same pain should she face a similar fate
While David’s mum Rachel died of ovarian cancer, and Lesley recalls how Rachel had asked her son: Just make it stop David, I’m so tired
Lesley told the Mirror how her dad talks to mum every night from his cell, which he shares with nine other men
He dreams of his wife’s screams of pain as her blood cancer took hold
He adored her, a tearful Lesley tells us
The only thing he really cared about was giving his family a nice life
Now it’s ended like this there’s a real possibility he will die alone in a foreign prison
I cannot bear the thought of anyone thinking badly of my dad, because my dad really is the loveliest of men
Lesley calls David every day and every time she is relieved to hear his voice
Lesley, a compliance consultant, said
He’s sad and very lonely
In his better moments, David tells how he longs to be back in Ashington, Northumberland, and to walk along the beach
He talks about mum all the time
He tries to remember the good times and looks back on family holidays
Janice’s side of the family fully supports David, Lesley said
They just want him home – they love him
Mum begged him for a long time (to assist her death) and was very clear about what she wanted
She was very much of the opinion that we have autonomy over our bodies
David had told Lesley that Janice asked him to help her to die but she says: My dad was very good at reassuring me
They never really let on how bad she was
She says her parents suffered with Covid lockdowns, which she claims made it harder to get medical support
David will face a life sentence in Cyprus for a murder charge, while assisted suicide carries a maximum sentence of 10 years
He pleaded not guilty to murder in a February court hearing in Cyprus
Lesley is raising funds for legal fees via the Crowd Justice website with the total at £14,000 so far
But time is running out, as David’s trial in Paphos begins on April 18
Michael Polak, of UK-based Justice Abroad, is representing David
The group has written to the island’s attorney general to ask for the charge to be downgraded
We will be doing everything we can to get David home, he said
It is in the public interest that he does not spend the rest of his life in prison
Nobody I’ve spoken to in Cyprus believes David Hunter should be on trial for murder
Police turned up at Lesley’s door in Norwich on December 18 to explain the situation in Cyprus
David had called his brother after taking an overdose and asked him to look after Lesley
His brother contacted UK police, who contacted Interpol and David was soon found
It is unclear if a note was left as items taken from the home have not yet been given to the defence
The next day David explained to Lesley that her mum had been in constant agony, and felt she had lost all her dignity – she had continual diarrhoea, was suffering horrific nosebleeds and her sight was going
She was unable to eat, drink or sleep, despite being exhausted
Lesley said David was unable to get her upstairs so they lay in reclining chairs downstairs, holding hands
Lesley, who has a pathological fear of flying, was unable to attend the funeral in Cyprus but helped to organise it
Janice would have turned 76 on March 30, and the day after marked the 57th anniversary of when they first met in a pub in Ashington
He thought she was the most beautiful girl in the town, Lesley recalls
She came over and said: ‘You can buy me a drink if you want’
He bought her a Bacardi and Coke, and that was it.  They adored each other

Forklift driver Barry Douglas, 44, and friend Claire Vickers, 46, appeared on ITV's This Morning in wheelchairs to talk about the accident which left them with life-changing injuries A man left in a wheelchair after a drunken waterpark accident took his own life just six months later, an inquest heard
Forklift driver Barry Douglas, 44, broke both his legs after sneaking into the lido with a friend at 2am and crashing into the barrier of a closed flume tube
The life-changing injuries left Barry, from Dundee, unable to work as he could not drive, forcing him to move house
The hearing in Winchester, heard that Barry, had moved to Aldershot with his stepfather at the age of 20 and had set up a stable life for himself
Despite some signs his condition was improving, Scottish-born Douglas took his own life in his studio flat in February of this year, the inquest was told
The Glasgow Rangers fan had been working as a forklift truck driver up until the time of his accident on the water slide
The inquest heard that in August 2021 having consumed a considerable amount of alcohol, Barry made the impulsive decision with Claire to break into Aldershot Lido
When the pair went down the water slide they slammed into a steel barrier that was blocking the end and sustained serious injuries
Reports at the time said they were then trapped for two hours before being rescued
Both Barry and friend, Claire Vickers, 46, appeared on ITV's This Morning in wheelchairs to talk about the incident
The inquest was also told that Douglas had a history of taking recreational drugs including cocaine and heroine
He had also spent a short time drug dealing and was stabbed in 2011, the inquest heard
Barry began experiencing a low mood and was known to drink between 500ml-1L of vodka a day, the inquest was told
His GP told the hearing that he had been prescribed anti-depressants following his lido accident
His mother, Ruth Douglas told the inquest that he had been desperate to get back to work after the accident
She added that doctors had told Barry that it might take up to two years to get his mobility back and that he was worried about being crippled
Barry's friends, having not heard from him for several days, contacted his tenant welfare officer who found him hanged in his flat in Aldershot in February 2022, the inquest heard
A post-mortem report read to the court stated that Barry had consumed a significant amount of alcohol before his death
Senior Coroner for Hampshire Christopher Wilkinson said that there was 'no clear explanation' for why Barry took his own life
Mr Wilkinson: He set himself up here in the UK
He started to consume alcohol to a greater extent and had been using street drugs
His [water slide] injuries were, in my opinion, life-changing
In his last few days there had been some hope that he was returning to work and was driving again
There was also a possibility that he was moving to other accommodation
It's regrettable that I cannot establish what he was thinking
He took his own life impulsively under the influence of alcohol, Mr Wilkinson added
The coroner recorded a conclusion of suicide

Suzanne Drinkwater woke up in summer last year to find her boyfriend dead in the bed beside her and she decided to take her own life- the couple's bodies would eventually be found there A woman tragically killed herself after waking up to find her boyfriend dead in their bed beside her
Suzanne Drinkwater woke up one morning in the summer last year and was horrified when she found her boyfriend 35-year-old Gavin Massey, was dead next to her
The heartbroken 32-year-old from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, took her own life that morning in the very same bed
When the couple were finally found after police bashed down their front door, one of the bodies was decomposing
She had been receiving help for a number of psychiatric conditions at the time of her death, the inquest into their deaths heard
Coroner Tom Osborne, sitting at Milton Keynes, heard how Gavin likely died from cardiomegaly, an enlarged heart, and left ventricular hypertrophy, worsened by the steroids he had been taking
His death was also exacerbated by a mixture of alcohol and drugs found in his system
The alarm was raised after Suzanne’s sister had been unable to contact her from August 4, and on August 7, she raised her fears with police
One day after that, they discovered the couple dead after police were forced to break into their home
There was no criticism of the agencies which had been helping both patients, during the joint inquest

Ian Chapman called the police after greeting a young man on a Lancashire bridge as he walked past with his dog and realising he was looking straight through him A passerby prevented a young man from taking his own life after spotting an eerie clue in his face
Ian Chapman, from Padiham, Lancashire, was walking over a bridge as he crossed paths with the stranger but after saying hello he realised there was something off
The 61-year-old noticed an absence of emotion in the man's eyes, as though he was looking straight through him
He realised he was going to take his own life and called the police, reports LancsLive
Ian said: I was walking past this gentleman who didn't reply to me
When I said hello and I turned around and he was climbing over the edge of the bridge
I offered him my phone, to see if there was anyone he wanted to ring
Then I thought, what am I doing? He could have just lost a family member and that could be really triggering for him
So, I turned away and called the police
Have you been affected by this story? Let us know at webnews@mirror. co
uk By the time Ian got to the end of the bridge, the police had already arrived
However, the dad-of-two didn't want to stay at the scene much longer and set off home
Ian said: I was just walking and my dog scared this lady who was tending to her garden
She saw me crying and asked if I was OK and if I wanted to come into her house
I just told her that I needed to get back home to my wife and I explained what had just happened
Her house was next door to a halfway house type place, so she came to tell me later on that the man had been saved
Although the gentleman was saved, Ian has no further update about him
The experience has stuck with him and a year on, Ian recognises that charities, particularly local ones, rely on funding which they often have to fight hard to get
Now, off the back of the incident he witnessed and his previous love of fundraising, Ian will be doing a walk, completely barefooted from Burnley to Bacup - a total of seven miles
Burnley born and bred, Ian decided he wanted to do the barefoot walk after brainstorming words that begin with the letter B, choosing the starting point, destination and how he'd go about it
His love for raising money came after the coronavirus pandemic which saw employees at his work laid of for one week every month

So, I decided I needed another focus and I was thinking, what can I do? I was contemplating things beginning with a B for Burnley and it went from there, my wife thinks I'm off my head
Ian will be raising money for Casual Minds Matter CIC, a Burnley based charity that help to provide professional support and counselling to men who are struggling with their mental health
I've never really seen anyone who's had to battle with depression or alcohol or drug abuse or anything like that, Ian continued
It's just never really been something that the people around me have suffered with

I obviously knew people were living with it but I didn't fully appreciate to what degree people lived with it
When I do my walks, I carry my trainers with me and it's like a safety net if I decide I want to give up
People that are suffering don't always have those safety nets though and that's why I'm raising money for the charity
I just want to make people aware that if you need help, there's always someone just a phone call away
Ian has been gearing himself up for his walk, which will take place on Saturday, August 20 from St

Get email updates with the day's biggest stories Ian Chapman called the police after greeting a young man on a Lancashire bridge as he walked past with his dog and realising he was looking straight through him A passerby prevented a young man from taking his own life after spotting an eerie clue in his face
Ian Chapman, from Padiham, Lancashire, was walking over a bridge as he crossed paths with the stranger but after saying hello he realised there was something off
The 61-year-old noticed an absence of emotion in the man's eyes, as though he was looking straight through him
He realised he was going to take his own life and called the police, reports LancsLive
Ian said: I was walking past this gentleman who didn't reply to me
When I said hello and I turned around and he was climbing over the edge of the bridge
I offered him my phone, to see if there was anyone he wanted to ring
Then I thought, what am I doing? He could have just lost a family member and that could be really triggering for him
So, I turned away and called the police
Have you been affected by this story? Let us know at webnews@mirror. co
uk By the time Ian got to the end of the bridge, the police had already arrived
However, the dad-of-two didn't want to stay at the scene much longer and set off home
Ian said: I was just walking and my dog scared this lady who was tending to her garden
She saw me crying and asked if I was OK and if I wanted to come into her house
I just told her that I needed to get back home to my wife and I explained what had just happened
Her house was next door to a halfway house type place, so she came to tell me later on that the man had been saved
Although the gentleman was saved, Ian has no further update about him
The experience has stuck with him and a year on, Ian recognises that charities, particularly local ones, rely on funding which they often have to fight hard to get
Now, off the back of the incident he witnessed and his previous love of fundraising, Ian will be doing a walk, completely barefooted from Burnley to Bacup - a total of seven miles
Burnley born and bred, Ian decided he wanted to do the barefoot walk after brainstorming words that begin with the letter B, choosing the starting point, destination and how he'd go about it
His love for raising money came after the coronavirus pandemic which saw employees at his work laid of for one week every month
He said: Since April this year, one week a month we get laid off due to a shortage in the supply chain

Edward Lake's three children, as well as their grandfather, were killed in a crash in September 2015 by a drunk driver who was then granted full parole last year A dad-of-three whose kids were killed in a horror car crash took his own life after Father's Day so they can all play together forever
Edward Lake, from Ontario, US, was found dead on Monday, the day after Father's Day
On Sunday, Edward’s wife Jennifer Neville-Lake shared a moving photo on social media showing their children’s grave
Then, late on Monday, she also tweeted the tragic news about her husband’s death
The couple’s three children were killed in a crash in September 2015 in Vaughan, caused by drunk driver Marco Muzzo, Global News reports
Daniel Neville-Lake, nine, Harrison, five, and Milly, two, as well as the children’s grandfather, Gary Neville, 65, were killed in the collision
The children’s grandmother and great-grandmother were also badly injured
During Muzzo’s sentencing, Edward said he had suffered from suicidal thoughts and anxiety since the crash
In February 2021, Muzzo was granted full parole
Sharing the devastating news about her husband's death, Jennifer tweeted: The eyes he shared with Harry are forever closed Daniel's curls will never shine in the sunlight again I will never see Milly's shy smile creep across his lips anymore
My children's father, Edward Lake, has joined our kids so they can play together, forever
Just the day before, she had tweeted after visiting their children's graves, writing: Father’s Day 2022.  This shouldn’t be real.  It can’t be
After Edward's death, Chief of York Regional Police Jim MacSween paid tribute after the tragedy, adding: This evening I was very saddened to learn of the tragic death of Ed Lake

Nick Phillips, 39, was working the night shift on Tuesday, August 30, when he was alerted by a member of staff that a woman had reportedly locked herself in the toilets in the Winter Gardens in an apparent attempt to take her own life and was unresponsive An ex-army man turned Morrisons manager saved a woman's life inside the store toilets
Nick Phillips, 39, was working the night shift on Tuesday, August 30, at the Southport branch when he was alerted by a member of staff that something serious had happened
A woman had reportedly locked herself in the toilets in the Winter Gardens in an apparent attempt to take her own life and was unresponsive
After knocking on the door, Mr Phillips broke down the door to get to the woman
He performed emergency CPR on the woman and she began breathing again, reports the Liverpool Echo
Both the police and ambulance services were called, and the woman was taken to hospital where she would receive further treatment
As an ex-army and former prison officer, Mr Phillips knew exactly what to do
His previous training meant that he knew compact CPR, and he has a history of tending to people in need
His wife, Catherine Phillips, said: Because of his experience, his brain goes into this mode where he does exactly what he needs to do to get stuff done, I’ve never known anyone like him
He gets the job done, so when this happened, I don’t know who the girl is, but she couldn't have wished for anyone better to come and save her life
He is the most resilient person I’ve ever met in my life
Catherine said her husband stayed on shift for hours after the incident to ensure that his staff were okay and felt supported
A spokesperson for North West Ambulance Service said: I can confirm an ambulance attended and took a patient to hospital

Jade Wilcott's family, from Plymouth, are campaigning for more awareness around mental health and say the mum was failed after losing her best friend and asking for help A heartbroken mum decided to end her own life after the sudden death of her best friend
Jade Wilcott's family told how defeated she must have felt to leave behind her daughter and most previous possession in life
She died overnight after a heart-to-heart with her granddad during which she had appeared to calm down, reports Plymouth Live
The 24-year-old struggled with her mental health which took a turn for the worst during lockdown after her friend and grandparents had to shield, and she felt extremely isolated
Despite her pleas for help, the young mum was failed, according to relatives who believe her death sends a clear message about the urgent need for mental health treatment
Jade was described as an intelligent, lovable and hardworking woman by family during her inquest at Plymouth Coroner's Court on Monday
Relatives said in a statement: Jade Elizabeth Wilcott was a beautiful, caring and thoughtful woman and mother
She was deeply loved by everyone who knew her
She struggled tremendously with her mental health from a young age and despite many times asking for help, she was failed
To take her own life, all must understand how defeated she must have felt leaving behind her most precious possession in life, her daughter Neveah
She will forever be missed
Jade's father told how his daughter had begged for help, which she should have received that same day
She messaged me that night and was saying that she needed help, he recalled
We ended up paying for private counselling because of the wait

The other thing that was affecting her was the Covid lockdown
Her grandparents had to shield and her friend
She felt very, very, very isolated
And then the sudden death of her friend, all these things drove her to it
Jade, of Southway in Plymouth, took her own life in June last year and her family are now raising awareness following their devastating loss
Our message is that mental health treatment needs to be there for people, her dad added
Senior coroner Ian Arrow noted evidence gathered from a number of witnesses, including Jade's GP
In his report, he highlighted how Jade had a history of depression and that her last attendance at the surgery in January 2021 saw her state she was feeling anxious all the time

She was prescribed medication to tackle her depression and help her sleep
A report from Livewell Southwest noted it received a referral to their Liaison Psychiatry team on May 14, weeks before Jade's death
One mental health nurse noted that Jade had admitted to taking a quantity of pills after recently suffering a bereavement
But a risk assessment considered her to be a low risk of self harm and that she did not wish to end her life
The mum had told medical staff that she had acted on impulse
Her grandfather Robert Wilcott said in a statement how Jade and her sister regularly visited and stayed at his home

May 30 was one such occasion, when she stayed over after a night out with friends for a birthday party
Upon returning, she joined her granddad in the summer house and Robert recalled her clearly feeling down and despondent at one point saying she had had enough
The pair continued to talk about how she was feeling and Jade eventually appeared to calm down
The inquest heard how Jade told Robert she was going for a cigarette before he fell asleep
Robert's wife found her unresponsive the following morning and Robert made attempts to revive her
Paramedics and police were also called but Jade sadly died during the night

Toxicologists confirmed Jade had taken a combination of alcohol and a 'non-toxic' level of cocaine while a post mortem gave the cause of death as ligature compression of the neck
Robert told in his statement how her death was a terrible loss to her family and described her as a fantastic girl and an amazing mother to her daughter
Civilian investigator Phil Trevains told the inquest it was clear Jade had been upset following the death of her mother a few years previously, compounded with the death of a close friend just a few weeks before her suicide
He said medical reports showed she had struggled with her mental health and noted that counselling suggestions offered to Jade had come a little too late
The expert further highlighted the difficulties of accessing counselling during the coronavirus lockdown
Mr Arrow concluded that Jade had sadly taken her own life and expressed his profound condolences to her family of which many attended the inquest
He said: She was clearly a young lady who had a lot to offer friends, family and society

Jade Roberts, 26, took her own life just hours after taking a video laughing and playing with her kids in the garden and was described as a woman with a 'heart of gold' A young mum was found dead just hours after laughing with her children in the garden as she faced a hidden battle behind her brave facade
Jade Roberts, 26, from Liverpool, has been described as a woman who would do anything for anyone and had a heart of gold, but was suffering with anxiety and depression underneath her smiles
Now, her heartbroken mum Tracey says she is dedicated to ending the stigma over the silent killer, and said she had two choices when her beautiful daughter died suddenly and just hours after she was captured on video laughing with her children
Tracey described her daughter as an unbelievable mum as every minute of the day was dedicated to her children, but she never realised the true extent of what her daughter was going through behind the scenes
As Tracey herself spiralled deeper into a depression after Jade took her own life in April last year, she told the ECHO she could either spiral further and give up or make a positive change and help others
With the help of her loved ones, the trained psychotherapist began the process of setting up a project in her daughter's name
The Jade Roberts Project will soon be opening its building at Merseyside's 109 Rocky Lane which will help them provide workshops on anxiety, depression, suicide prevention and coping techniques as well as providing a counselling service
Those in suicidal crisis can access the project through a referral
After losing Jade to suicide last year, I've never experienced depression like it, said Tracey
I was stuck in my bedroom, crying all the time, no motivation
I was suffering PTSD, I wasn't sleeping
My daughter had to basically look after me
I have a lot of resilience and I had two choices
I could either go further and give up, but I went with the other choice, to help
I don't want anyone to go through the pain that myself and my family have gone through
The pain will never go away, I'm just learning to live with it
With the hope of ending the stigma and spreading the message that it's okay to not be okay, the family say it feels like Jade is still here as they create a legacy in her memory and for her children
Tracey added: After that I lived in the library, I did a lot of research
There's no help out there for people
I thought I have to change this
I truly believe everything I've learnt about the signs, all the knowledge I now have, Jade would still be here
A fundraising page was set up last year to kickstart the charity with the money going towards the renting of the building so people can attend when they are referred, as well as allowing the volunteers to get the relevant training
But more needs to be raised to ensure the help can continue, and more training can be undertaken to help save lives
The fundraiser, which will go towards training such as ASIST (Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training), can be found here
More information about ASIST can be found by clicking here

*In an emergency, dial 999 for urgent help Tracey added: The more people trained in ASIST the more lives can be saved, but it's over £100 per person
There's a five-day course in October that's £3,000 each but I truly believe with these skills, we can reach out to more
With the hopes of an open day on October 1 and the official launch of the project on October 3, Tracey is reaching out for more volunteers who are willing to help as well as support workers and counsellors
Those that are can email enquiries@thejaderobertsproject. co. uk
As well as a 10-week project focusing on mental health and a counselling service, Tracey has high hopes for the future in the form of a befriending service, yoga classes, walks in the park and hiring a minibus for days out
A billboard outside of their building will also spread the message that it's okay to not be okay
She said: Suicide is a silent killer, you can't see what's going on in someone's head
You can see a black eye or a broken leg and breaking that stigma, to me, is about more people coming forward and talking about how they are really feeling
It's about making people feel listened to and giving them hope
See what’s happening near you by entering your postcode below or visit InYourArea After Jade's death, tributes came pouring in for her, with the devoted mum described as a caring and compassionate woman
Having this charity in her name is an honour, her family said, with Tracey adding: It isn't just a random project, it's emotional because of what it stands for
But it's in honour of my beautiful daughter to help people and save lives and while I'm doing this, it's like she's still here, her name is being mentioned all the time
In the hope of spreading awareness and raising further funds towards the project, Jade's siblings Danni and Jake will be bravely taking to the skies on September 24 at 2pm for a skydive
Having already raised over £1,000, the fundraiser can be found by clicking here

She said: Suicide is a silent killer, you can't see what's going on in someone's head
You can see a black eye or a broken leg and breaking that stigma, to me, is about more people coming forward and talking about how they are really feeling
It's about making people feel listened to and giving them hope

Having this charity in her name is an honour, her family said, with Tracey adding: It isn't just a random project, it's emotional because of what it stands for
But it's in honour of my beautiful daughter to help people and save lives and while I'm doing this, it's like she's still here, her name is being mentioned all the time
In the hope of spreading awareness and raising further funds towards the project, Jade's siblings Danni and Jake will be bravely taking to the skies on September 24 at 2pm for a skydive

Chris Lam died on April 7 after suffering from with depression since the Hilllsborough disaster in 1989 and had spent his life campaigning tirelessly for justice A daughter has paid tribute to her best friend dad who died at the age of 52 after suffering depression since surviving the Hilllsborough tragedy
Chris Lam died on April 7 this year having spent his life campaigning tirelessly for justice having survived the 1989 Hilllsborough disaster that claimed the lives of 97 people
His daughter Rebecca said he struggled with the tragedy since then
Rebecca told the Liverpool Echo : He was a Hillsborough survivor, he's struggled a lot since then, and always struggled in April in the lead up to the anniversary
She said: We knew he was struggling but we've all said none of us expected he would have done anything like this
Paying tribute to her dad, Rebecca said he was a well known and genuine man, who was part of Widnes Running Club where he was known by the nickname Mr Widnes
Rebecca added: He was genuine, he was full of life, always willing to give a hand to anybody
He was there for anybody to have a chat
He was like my best friend, we just bounced off each other
We kept each other going, he's always been my rock
He was so well known we couldn't go anywhere without him bumping into somebody that he knew
She has now set up a Gofundme page to raise money for the Hillsborough Survivors Support Alliance, who provided counselling to her dad, and Amparo, a charity that offers support to anyone affected by suicide
On the page she says: Chris was a wonderful man who brought happiness wherever he went
He was warm, kind, generous, funny, a sportsman, a supporter, a friend to many, a loved one and a doting father
He was also a massive Liverpool FC supporter and a Hillsborough survivor
He campaigned tirelessly for justice and felt passionately about the work of the HSA
He very sadly ended his own life in April 2022
Amparo have offered invaluable support to his loved ones during this difficult time
We believe that raising money for these two organisations in his name will help leave a positive legacy

Police officer David Loudon left a family holiday in Wales early and killed himself and son Harrison while his wife and step-children were still away in a tragic set of events A police sergeant who was driven mad by the coronavirus lockdown gassed his three-year-old autistic son to death before killing himself
David Loudon, an officer with West Mercia police, was suffering from depression and anxiety, an inquest heard today
The bodies of the sergeant and his son Harrison were found at their Kidderminster home in August 2021 while the rest of their family were away on holiday
Mr Loudon left a suicide note for his wife saying she'd be better off without him
The court heard how the boy had recently been diagnosed with suspected autism and his behaviour was proving challenging
Covid and the subsequent lockdowns and restrictions had also led to Mr Loudon being unable to get the face-to-face medical attention he felt he and Harrison needed
He left the family holiday in Wales early and killed himself and Harrison while his wife and step-children were still away, Stourport Coroner's Court heard
Mr Loudon had meticulously planned the deaths and also left notes for his family and sent letters to his friends, explaining that he had decided to take his own life and the reasons why
Worcestershire Coroner, David Reid, returned conclusions that Mr Loudon had taken his own life while Harrison Loudon had been unlawfully killed
The inquest had heard how in the various letters and notes he left, he said he was now with Harrison and the angels in heaven, Birmingham Live reports
The tragedy happened at the Loudon's home in Cairndhu Drive, Kidderminster, on August 13 last year
Mr Loudon's wife, Sam, who is also a West Mercia Police officer, told how they had been at a caravan park in Rhyl with her two children and also her in-laws
She told how her husband had made it clear that he didn't want to be there as he was feeling very low in his mood and also felt physically unwell
Harrison was also having frequent meltdowns, the hearing was told
Three days into the holiday, it was decided that Mr Loudon would take Harrison home
In her statement read to the inquest, Mrs Loudon said she had lots of phone calls and text messages with her husband in the following days and everything seemed fine
But on the morning of August 13 she couldn't get hold of her husband on the phone
She also noticed on the camera the family had installed in Harrison's bedroom that he was in bed but hadn't changed position for several hours
I got a knot in my stomach - I knew something was not right, her statement said
I knew Dave was low but I had no idea that suicide was being contemplated, it was never discussed and wasn't a concern
She said a few months previously Mr Loudon had told her I think you and Harrison would be better off without me
She said she thought he meant he was going to leave them and never for a second imagined he was planning suicide
Mrs Loudon rang the police and they forced an entry into the house and found the body of Mr Loudon and Harrison in their respective bedrooms
A post mortem examination for both of them concluded they had died of asphyxiation
The inquest had heard how Mr Loudon went to his GP the year before this happened and said he was feeling low, depressed and anxious, but not suicidal
He was prescribed anti-depressants, but didn't take them, and also had six counselling sessions which were arranged by West Mercia Police
Detective Inspector Mark Walters from West Mercia Police, who carried out an investigation into the double-death, said they were well planned
He said an examination of his phone revealed extensive searches
Several notes and letters were found
One was for his wife, Sam, in which he spoke about his fears for Harrison’s future
I can’t watch Harrison regress and become scared and confused with the world around him
I can’t let that destroy us, the pressure and my diseased mind won out I couldn’t see that this would get anything than worse
He also wrote: The only way is to die, I couldn’t leave you with Harrison, it would be too much
I did it out of love and desperation
In her most recent statement, which was read out to the inquest, Mrs Loudon said: I felt devastated that he didn’t tell me how he was feeling - he had lost hope in everything
I loved him very much but it was an unforgivable decision, I wished he had told me
I will never be able to forgive David for taking the life of our little boy Harrison - he had no right to take my son’s life, regardless of how he was feeling

Benjamin Davis, from Greater Manchester, was given the reference in the context that his autism diagnosis was. .
part of him but not all of him, a court heard A 22-year-old took his own life after being given a gravestone reference during a therapy session, a court heard
Benjamin Davis, also known as Binyomin Chaim Davis, took his own life only a few months after the session, having never got over that experience, his dad said
The young man was found at his home in Prestwich, Greater Manchester, and died at Salford Royal Hospital in November five days later
An inquest was held at Bolton Coroner's Court on Wednesday where private counsellor Avremi Rosenberg admitted that he should have used different wording in his session with Benjamin, who was 21 at the time
He also accepted that the language was inappropriate, reports Manchester Evening News
Mr Davis, Benjamin's dad, told the court that his son had a charming smile and was a special person
Speaking at the inquest, he said: We really miss him
He had a kind nature with a charming smile
He was a great student, he enjoyed photography, walking, and spending time with his family
He was a real pleasure to be with and he’s missed by family and friends
Despite his academic prowess, Benjamin struggled initially to fit in at school but eventually made a close knit group of friends
His challenges at school meant Benjamin was diagnosed with depression and anxiety in 2018, Mr Davis continued
The youngster was also diagnosed with autism in 2021, assistant coroner Rachel Syed heard
After this diagnosis, Benjamin had five counselling sessions with Mr Rosenberg in spring last year
And it was during these sessions in which Mr Rosenberg referenced a gravestone, Mr Davis said
He added: I asked Mr Rosenberg about it and he confirmed he did [say it]
When asked why used the imagery, Mr Rosenberg said he said 'in the context that his autism diagnosis was… part of him but not all of him'
He added: Benjamin approached me because he knew I was a counsellor with experience with working with people on the autism spectrum
In hindsight, this would have been better dealt with by the NHS
I did apologise to Benjamin for the way it came over
It was definitely not said in a blunt way
It was very much in the context that his autism diagnosis was very important and it was part of him but not all of him, and in that context what would be written on his gravestone
In the future whatever I can do to help you to come to terms about what has happened, I would properly arrange it
I express my sincerest, sincerest condolences
When asked by the coroner if his choice of words was inappropriate, Mr Rosenberg replied: Definitely, yes
Ms Syed said at the conclusion of the hearing that she would be writing a letter of concern to Mr Rosenberg’s organisation
She also will be writing letters of concern to Benjamin’s GP surgery Whittaker Lane Medical Centre and Greater Manchester Mental Health Trust (GMMH)
The coroner explained: A formal letter of concern will be written to the GP, GMMH, and the private organisation, highlighting the need to ensure a more collaborative working approach between these organisations and sharing information such as diagnoses of autism
I will also reference the need to have more training on autism as a condition
Earlier in the hearing, Benjamin’s GP in the final months of his life, Dr Rebecca-Ann Sheppard-Hickey, said she could not find a record of a formal autism diagnosis in his notes
Dr Ruth Watson, from GMMH, carried out an internal review of Benjamin’s care, and also admitted mistakes were made with clinical staff now receiving more in-depth training on autism
She said: The main focus is that staff need additional training on autism
It is going to be added to our clinical risk training as an additional focus point
Dr Watson did however add it was difficult to say if Benjamin’s death was preventable from the perspective of mental health services, as his last involvement with the service came around two months before his passing
Recording a verdict of suicide, Ms Syed confirmed that Benjamin’s medical cause of death was hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy
She concluded: I am sadly satisfied to the relevant legal threshold [Benjamin] intended to take his own life
I am therefore in law required to record a verdict of suicide
I hope you can focus on the wonderful memories you have of Benjamin

Craig Cambridge, 51, saw his life spiralling downwards after his daughter, Leah, died following a botched Brazilian butt lift in 2018 and tragically took his own life A dad took his own life after his daughter died following a botched Brazilian butt lift operation in Turkey
Craig Cambridge, 51, found his life spiralling downwards after his 29-year-old daughter Leah Cambridge died following a 2018 operation in Turkey that went wrong
The dad was tragically found dead at his home in Leeds and an inquest has found how he had never been able to get over Leah’s awful death
On the day he died, he had tried to ring doctors three times before his death but they had been closed because it was a bank holiday, Leeds Live reports
After an investigation into his death, senior coroner Kevin McLoughlin said he would be contacting the surgeon who botched Leah’s operation
Craig struggled with alcohol dependency and depression after his daughter’s tragic death, Wakefield Coroners' Court heard
On April, 5, 2021, his daughter's partner found Craig dead in his loft
This came nearly three years after Leah died in Izmir, Turkey, in August 2018
She died from a pulmonary embolism after Dr Ali Uckan accidentally injected fat into her veins
Leah had three heart attacks at the operating table
Mr McLoughlin conducted the inquests for the dad and daughter and said he wanted to let Dr Ali Uckan know the damage his surgery caused
He said to Craig's daughters Hayley and Chelsea and ex-partner Theresa Hall: Normally I am quite detached and hard-hearted about inquests, but when I saw another tragedy had befallen your family, I felt quite grievous
Having conducted the inquest into Leah all those years ago, I was incensed that the surgeon in Turkey stood well clear
I am proposing to send the report to the surgeon to make him aware of the tentacles of this
I am intending to send it to the medical authorities in Turkey to make them aware of how a tragedy manifests itself years later
I feel dreadfully sorry for you as a family
Chelsea and her partner had gone to see him on April 5, 2021, but when they were unable to get in, Chelsea’s partner ended up climbing through a window
What is happening where you live? Find out by adding your postcode
It was then he found the body of the former personal trainer and called paramedics
Craig was tragically pronounced dead at 7:50pm that evening
He had left notes for both his daughters
Craig had a history of depression and anxiety that became much worse after Leah’s death
He had been on medication and turned to alcohol and was under the care of a community mental health team
Police also found that the morning he took his own life he had tried to call doctors three times, but they were closed because it was a bank holiday
Dr Uckan did speak at Leah's inquest, where he called the operation a guessing game, speaking to Leah's widower Scott
Mr McLoughlin branded the surgeon a coward back in 2019 for not answering her family's questions
The coroner said that he had written to the doctor eight times since to ask him to give evidence at Craig's inquest - but got no response
As he returned a verdict of suicide today, Mr McLoughlin said: I am reliant upon on the pathologist for the cause of death, which in this case is hanging
This was a suicide attributed in part to the death of his daughter who died in surgery in Turkey

Why he ended up in the Devon seafront hotel where Agatha Christie spent her wedding night and why he apparently ended his life there has never been established A chilling death that was compared to an Agatha Christie novel remains unsolved twenty-five years later
The man was found dead in a seafront hotel room in Torquay, Devon - the same town where the thriller writer was born
Mr Patel was found dead at the Grand Hotel and, next to his naked body, there was a glass of Coke which contained the poison cyanide
It turned out the room had been booked under a false name, with Mr Patel giving a fake home address in London
Mr Patel checked into the landmark hotel in September 1997 after having stayed for three days in the modest Lee's Hotel and Cantonese Restaurant, reports DevonLive
The mystery guest, in his mid-thirties, ordered room service and ate a meal of roast lamb, washed down with a glass of Frascati, an Italian white wine
His body was found by a chambermaid the next day, on the 24
His black suit, white shirt and multi-coloured tie were neatly folded on his bed, and on the bedside table was £94
12 in cash and an empty wine glass
But when the authorities were called in and tried to identify him, the lines of inquiry carried out the investigators found a series of dead ends
It was only due to a coincidence that a tantalising clue emerged
Two marks were seen on his shoulder, a sign that he was a member of the Tamil Tigers, a rebel group in Sri Lanka, an island state in the Indian Ocean
But why he ended up in the Devon seafront hotel where Agatha Christie spent her wedding night, and why he apparently ended his life there, has never been established
What did your local area use to look like? Find out with InYourArea's tool which takes you on a trip down Memory Lane
When the body was removed to the mortuary, coroner’s officer Robin Little spotted the marks on Mr Patel’s shoulder
The then South Devon coroner Hamish Turner later recalled: We spent a year trying to find out who this chap was
We even photographed his face and sent that photo around the country hoping someone would recognise him, but had no luck
It was perhaps a grim thing to do – but we had nothing else to go on because he carried nothing to identify himself
It was a lucky coincidence that the local forensic pathologist, Dr Guyan Fernando, is from Sri Lanka
He was told of these marks in a chance conversation with Mr Little and was able to tell us that the dead man must be from his country because these marks were the tribal sign of the Tamil Tigers, a rebel group in Sri Lanka

The cyanide was another clue that the dead man was a Tamil Tiger because, Mr Fernando said, they always carried a cyanide pill with them in case they were caught
Then there was a courteous note, penned by Mr Patel
It read: I am very sorry for what I have done here but this is the place I had to carry out the deed
To the chef, the food was magnificent – fit for the gods – for a final meal.  Thank you
Mr Turner said: I could only remark at the inquest that his reference to this place might be because he had read some Agatha Christie story and knew of her connection with the Grand Hotel
The dead man’s clothing was examined for clues to his identity but there were no laundry tags or marks that might help
He had a rather nice Parker pen which might have suggested he was an educated man, Mr Turner added, but despite months of investigation by the police we never discovered his real name or what he was doing in Torquay
It was, he added, the most baffling case of his career, and he could only now surmise that the dead man must have been running away from someone he feared, which was why he chose to end his life when he did
As to exactly why he died, and whether he was a devotee of Agatha Christie, I suppose we will never know

Get email updates with the day's biggest stories Why he ended up in the Devon seafront hotel where Agatha Christie spent her wedding night and why he apparently ended his life there has never been established A chilling death that was compared to an Agatha Christie novel remains unsolved twenty-five years later
The man was found dead in a seafront hotel room in Torquay, Devon - the same town where the thriller writer was born
Mr Patel was found dead at the Grand Hotel and, next to his naked body, there was a glass of Coke which contained the poison cyanide
It turned out the room had been booked under a false name, with Mr Patel giving a fake home address in London
Mr Patel checked into the landmark hotel in September 1997 after having stayed for three days in the modest Lee's Hotel and Cantonese Restaurant, reports DevonLive
The mystery guest, in his mid-thirties, ordered room service and ate a meal of roast lamb, washed down with a glass of Frascati, an Italian white wine
His body was found by a chambermaid the next day, on the 24
His black suit, white shirt and multi-coloured tie were neatly folded on his bed, and on the bedside table was £94
12 in cash and an empty wine glass
But when the authorities were called in and tried to identify him, the lines of inquiry carried out the investigators found a series of dead ends
It was only due to a coincidence that a tantalising clue emerged
Two marks were seen on his shoulder, a sign that he was a member of the Tamil Tigers, a rebel group in Sri Lanka, an island state in the Indian Ocean
But why he ended up in the Devon seafront hotel where Agatha Christie spent her wedding night, and why he apparently ended his life there, has never been established

When the body was removed to the mortuary, coroner’s officer Robin Little spotted the marks on Mr Patel’s shoulder
The then South Devon coroner Hamish Turner later recalled: We spent a year trying to find out who this chap was
We even photographed his face and sent that photo around the country hoping someone would recognise him, but had no luck
It was perhaps a grim thing to do – but we had nothing else to go on because he carried nothing to identify himself
It was a lucky coincidence that the local forensic pathologist, Dr Guyan Fernando, is from Sri Lanka
He was told of these marks in a chance conversation with Mr Little and was able to tell us that the dead man must be from his country because these marks were the tribal sign of the Tamil Tigers, a rebel group in Sri Lanka

The cyanide was another clue that the dead man was a Tamil Tiger because, Mr Fernando said, they always carried a cyanide pill with them in case they were caught
Then there was a courteous note, penned by Mr Patel
It read: I am very sorry for what I have done here but this is the place I had to carry out the deed
To the chef, the food was magnificent – fit for the gods – for a final meal.  Thank you
Mr Turner said: I could only remark at the inquest that his reference to this place might be because he had read some Agatha Christie story and knew of her connection with the Grand Hotel
The dead man’s clothing was examined for clues to his identity but there were no laundry tags or marks that might help
He had a rather nice Parker pen which might have suggested he was an educated man, Mr Turner added, but despite months of investigation by the police we never discovered his real name or what he was doing in Torquay
It was, he added, the most baffling case of his career, and he could only now surmise that the dead man must have been running away from someone he feared, which was why he chose to end his life when he did

Police in the US believe prisoner Casey White wasn't smart enough to plan the breakout and said exemplary employee Vicky White was in the perfect position to organise it all A prison guard who took her own life after being on the run with a murderer for 11 days was the mastermind behind the the whole plan, police believe
Hulking 6ft9 prisoner Casey White - alleged to have been officer Vicky White's lover - wasn't smart enough to plan it all, according to Lauderdale County Sheriff Rick Singleton
In an interview with CNN, Singleton said 56-year-old Vicky - who he described as an exemplary employee - was in a position to coordinate the jailbreak, organising a van in the morning and ensuring all the armed deputies were not in the building
She knew that the booking officer wasn’t going to question her, the assistant director, when she told her that she was going to take him to court and drop him off with other employees, Singleton told the network
Not long before she died by suicide, Vicky seemed to be angry at Casey, 38, for deciding to stay at a motel
Some of her last words were recorded by police as officers rammed into the pair's Cadillac into a ditch after a dramatic chase
She's heard saying: Airbags are going off
Let’s get out and run
And then: You had to stay in some f****** motel
Vicky, who had made up a bogus medical appointment for the felon on April 29, shot herself moments later
Singleton said wigs, weapons including an AR-15 rifle, a 9mm handgun and $29,000 worth of cash had also been found
He said Vicky had sold her house to raise the funds
She would have been facing up to 10 years in prison for helping Casey escape
Singleton said Vicky, formerly second command at Alabama's Lauderdale County Jail, was a much liked, respected employee who other staff viewed as a mother figure
She was even about to be awarded Employee of the Year for the fifth time
What in the world provoked her, or prompted her, to pull something like this, I don’t know
I don’t know if we’ll ever know, he said
I had every bit of trust in Vicky White
She had been an exemplary employee
Casey appeared before a judge in Alabama on Tuesday night charged with escaping prison
Previously Vanderburgh County Sheriff Dave Wedding said that because a large number of guns were found inside the car, if Vicky and Casey they had not been rammed off the road the day could have ended with more bloodshed
He told reporters: We later found out that [if they hadn’t rammed the vehicle], the fugitive was going to engage in a shootout with law enforcement
That action may have saved many of my deputies and fellow law enforcement officers’ lives
The couple, who were not related, are said to have been in a jailhouse romance for around two years
Their dramatic escape came on the eve of Vicky’s retirement as a correctional officer
Since their 2020 meeting, Vicky had regularly been driving the two hours to where Casey was incarcerated, at the William E Donaldson Correctional Facility
She gave a false name to prison authorities

Mental health campaigner Trevor Coult has shared his devastation at losing Pete Carson who served in the Royal Irish Regiment with Trevor in Afghanistan and was found dead in a suspected suicide A decorated war hero is mourning his 13th ­comrade lost to the armed forces mental health crisis
Campaigner Trevor Coult, who won the Military Cross for service in Iraq, was devastated to learn last week of the latest death
Pete Carson, who served in the Royal Irish Regiment with Trevor in Afghanistan, was found dead in a suspected suicide
Anguished Trevor, 47, said: In any other profession there would be calls for a major inquiry – but it seems the Government doesn’t mind if those who served their country kill themselves
He added: I was absolutely devastated to learn that Pete had died
That’s at least six people from my old regiment who have died and at least 13 people who I knew or served with have now taken their own lives
There have been more deaths
I don’t think there is any job in the country where someone would know so many people who have taken their own lives
The 12 others who Trevor knew include fellow Afghan vet Brett Savage, 32, who had taken part in a documentary in which he said the Ministry of Defence was not doing enough to help
Before he died he spoke about combat in Afghanistan and said: My unit was under fire for 55 days.  It was non-stop
I saw good men killed
We lost four in total
I was blown up with an RPG and lost the hearing in my right ear
I was also shot in the chest, the body armour saved my life.  I went crazy
I was on drugs, drinking all the time
Shortly after Brett’s death, Sgt Fraser Stirling, also a member of the Royal Irish Regiment and a one-time colleague of Trevor’s, took his own life aged 30
The other tragedies include Northern Ireland veteran Deane Hart, 53, and Capt Gary Case, a veteran of Iraq, who died weeks after being awarded an MBE
Capt Case, 50, had gained ­promotion from the ranks and was one of the most popular officers in the Rifles regiment
Another of those who died was Jamie Davis, also a former member of the Rifles
The 30-year-old dad-of-two hanged himself in January 2020
He had previously suffered shrapnel wounds and witnessed the deaths of colleagues in both Iraq and Afghanistan
His widow Alicia said he had nightmares night and day and was ashamed of his condition
She added: He was screaming in the middle of the night
He was riddled with guilt
One of his best mates got killed and he said that should have been him
The other soldiers and veterans in confirmed or suspected suicides are Danny Johnston, 35, Mitchell Matthews, 24, James Ross, 30, Paul Cochrane, 18, Eddie Murphy, 50, Andy McFarland, 32 and Paul Brennan
Dad of one Trevor, from Suffolk, added: The MoD says that the deaths have nothing in common and there isn’t a problem with suicide
All of those who died had mental health issues, they had all seen combat and they all served in the armed forces – that’s what they had in common
Since 2017 at least 350 veterans and service personnel are believed to have taken their own lives
At least 22 have died from suspected suicides so far this year
The vast majority had seen combat
The MoD said: There are many ­varied and complex reasons why ­someone may take their own life and we will continue to do all that we can to provide support and mental health ­provision to those who have ­dedicated their lives to the service of this country
The Sunday People ’s Save Our Soldiers campaign is calling for a radical overhaul of the way top brass treat mental health

Police, coastguard and RNLI teams conducted a search of the North Wales coast over several days and eventually recovered the body of Garry Jones after he left his family home in Stoke-on-Trent A man sent a heartbreaking final text to his wife before his body was tragically found in the sea
Garry Jones, 55, had left his family home in Stoke-on-Trent on January 5 to stay at a Travelodge in Cheshire
However, the following day, the warehouse worker sent a text to his wife of 19 years, Christine, which caused his family concern
The devastating message read: Please tell everyone that I love them and that I am so so sorry
He gave details of the location of his belongings, before signing off with a final message, sorry for everything, love you, reported North Wales Live
Garry was reported missing shortly afterwards - with his body found the sea in March by a catamaran crew five miles from Rhyl
Senior coroner for North Wales east and central, John Gittins, heard details of the police investigation that followed Gary's disappearance
North Wales Police used number plate recognition software and traced his car travelling towards Towyn on January 6
Later that day officers found Gary's car parked on St Asaph Avenue in Colwyn Bay
Whilst he was not present, officers discovered a note inside the vehicle, signed by Garry, which contained the message: I am so sorry for any heartbreak or upset that I have caused or will cause by my actions
Police, coastguard and RNLI teams conducted a search of the North Wales coast over several days but no trace of him was found.  At 3
22pm on March 3, 2022, Rhyl Coastguard received a call from the crew of windfarm crew transfer vessel, Mareel Onyx, who reported they had found a man's body in the water around five miles from the Rhyl coast
A DNA sample confirmed it was Garry as the inquest was told he had visited his GP before his death with concerns for his mental health and had been signed off work
In a statement, Garry's wife said an accident at work and the declining health of his father had affected his mood, and he had started crying more
Mr Gittins gave the cause of death as drowning and recorded a conclusion of suicide
Addressing his family, the coroner said: I suspect that some of the not knowing is worse than the knowing
The only comfort that I can offer is that he was found
It is little degree of solace but I hope it can provide some closure for you

Robert Needham, 42, killed his wife Kelly Fitzgibbons, 40, and his two daughters, Ava, four, Lexi, two, and their dog at their £600,000 home before taking his own life in March 2020 A distraught uncle has described his moment of terror when he found his niece and her daughters slaughtered by her husband
Robert Needham, 42, killed his wife Kelly Fitzgibbons, 40, and his two daughters, Ava, four, Lexi, two, and their dog at their £600,000 home before taking his own life
The tragedy happened in the quiet village of Woodmancote in West Sussex just a week into lockdown in March 2020
Kelly’s uncle, Ronald Peacock, told an inquest in Horsham, West Sussex, on Tuesday about the moment he found their bodies after climbing through an open window into the couple's bedroom
Mr Peacock added: I realised I could see Ava’s head on the bed, under the duvet
Both girls laying side by side in the bed
I could see Kelly on the floor, near the door
Rob was on the floor in the hallway
I climbed through the window
The TV was on and I could see blood on the pillows
I could tell they were both dead.  Kelly was dead
It was obvious from the position and the amount of blood there was nothing I could do for her
He also said he found Needham lying in the hallway with the shotgun pointed at his head.  He then called 999
The Sun reports he said: I could feel the cold on the back of my head
Kelly was cold, Ava was cold and Lexi too was cold
The inquest was also told Needham was a secret cocaine user and, in the days leading up to the tragedy, had tried to get hold of the drug from a supplier without success
The inquest heard toxicology tests also showed he had not taken any cocaine at the time of the tragedy, but a hair sample test showed he had been a cocaine user
It was also said that in the past he had been forced to see a doctor over the damage the drug had caused to his nose
It was also said Needham had been suffering financial problems in the run-up to the Covid lockdown in March 2020
The family had earlier moved into his family home to help care for his mother, Maureen, 77, after his father Rex, who suffered from Parkinson's disease, died in 2017
They lived upstairs rent-free while his mother lived in a granny flat downstairs
He was building an extension to the house but the family had run into financial problems and had stopped contributing to the bills
The builder had also been forced to take out a loan of £20,000 from his mother to cover his family's day-to-day living
When Covid struck, Needham found it difficult getting hold of building supplies and had to put the work extension on hold, it was said
In a statement to the hearing, Kelly's twin sister, Emma Ambler, said she did not believe the couple had any serious money worries
The inquest heard how Needham had a history of mental illness and an official caution for theft but omitted it when applying for a firearms licence in 2016
He was issued with a firearms licence despite admitting the lies to a police officer, a coroner was told
He then used the certificate to buy a semi-automatic shotgun shortly before killing his family
Needham declared on the application he had never had a criminal conviction and had no history of mental health problems
However, he had previously suffered at least two bouts of mental health problems in 2003 and 2013 and had been treated for depression, it was said
He had also previously been issued with a caution from police for stealing a bicycle going back many years
At the time of his application, a firearms enquiry officer from Hampshire Police questioned Needham at this home, the inquest heard
When Needham was told his GP would be contacted in relation to the application he then told the cop about his mental health problems and admitted having a criminal conviction
The hearing was told he told the officer he did not think they were relevant because they were a long time ago
Chief Inspector Nigel Lecointe of Hampshire said he would have expected greater scrutiny of the application
He said the omissions should have been a cause for concern and raised a red flag
Guidance for firearms licensing in 2016 stated: Whether the applicant is found to have made a false statement is of particular relevance
Deliberate failure to declare relevant convictions, medical conditions or medical history tends to show unfitness regardless of whether the certificate would have been refused if the appropriate declaration had been made
The firearms licence was approved by Sussex Police after Needham and the family moved to the county
The hearing was told Hampshire Police was minded to grant the firearms certificate but Mr Needham moved home and the decision to grant final approval was transferred to the Sussex force
Firearms licences are valid for five years
Mr Lecointe told the court: We should never be complacent about what we do
Our job is to try and do the right thing but we will make judgements with the best intentions
We won’t always get it right but we will try.  The inquest continues

Retired police officer and dad-of-three Haydn Morgan said his beloved daughter Bronwen, 26, suffered a devastating injustice in relation to her mental health care while she trained to be a psychiatric nurse at Cardiff University Parents who camped outside their beloved daughter's room to stop her harming herself have shared their heartbreak after she tragically took her own life
Haydn Morgan and his wife Jayne took it in turns to sleep on a camper bed against the door of their 26-year-old daughteer Bronwen's room so she wouldn't escape, self-harm or take her own life
Dad-of-three Haydn said his daughter - who was studying to be a mental health nurse at Cardiff University - didn't like it, but they couldn't let her out of our sight because of the risk she posed to herself
He added: It was the only way we could keep her safe
Haydn - who says his daughter suffered a devastating injustice in her care - said he and his wife fought for Bronwen to be admitted to a psychiatric war but it was always refused
He said: We just didn't know where to turn
It had all been so different just a few years earlier
Growing up Bronwen Morgan was a talented swimmer, played the piano and was a popular Girl Guide
She also loved working with children and had a natural way of connecting with them
Before long she found herself a job in the behavioural unit at her old primary school where she earned the nickname Bomb-proof Bron as she was always calm and in control under pressure
But during her time in Cardiff University, where she was training to become a mental health nurse, her own bouts of anxiety and depression intensified and she developed an eating disorder
Her problems were further exacerbated by the pandemic when the usual activities she needed to manage her mental health disappeared virtually overnight
This coincided with the services of her community psychiatric nurse (CPN) being taken away without warning
Haydn, a dad-of-three, added that Bronwen would frequently be detained by police under the Mental Health Act and sent to Hafan Y Coed, a specialist psychiatric unit on the grounds of University Hospital Llandough
However he claims she would often be discharged from the unit without the family knowing which led to her going missing
Bronwen began to feel helpless and isolated which meant her mental health spiralled out of control and left her in a place that she felt she could not find a way back from, added Haydn, from Cyncoed, Cardiff
After many months of pain and trauma, Bronwen was allegedly told by medical staff that if she were to find herself in a crisis in the future, the police would arrest her
This decision, her family claims, was the final straw
Haydn, a retired police officer, admitted that he has struggled to shake the memory of the last day he saw Bronwen alive
He recalled: That week she was happy, smiling and in a really good place
We hadn't seen her like that for ages
Unbeknown to us she had this plan to take her own life
In a way she was saying goodbye to us, but nobody knew
She had been trying to do it for a long time
We've been told she was probably feeling a sense of elation and a sense of knowing that 'I'm going to take my life and my family will be able to get on with their lives'
Bronwen was found unresponsive at a hotel in Cardiff and died on Thursday, August 27, 2020
As well as writing to Cardiff and Vale University Health Board in a last-ditch cry for help, she penned a letter to her mum, dad and two younger sisters, Tesni and Cerys
She said she wanted us to know that she had the best childhood ever and that we'd done nothing wrong
It was just heartbreaking, added Haydn
We had literally lost all hope
We couldn't find a way of going forward and her mental health team had locked her in this cocoon and insisted that this was the therapy she should be having
Haydn, who is now seeing a therapist himself, added: Now I'm retired, you see photographs of her around the house all the time and it brings it all back
I've been miserable, tired and angry - I think we all have
Her heartbroken family claims that if they had been given more of a say in her care - which would have led to a more tailored and bespoke approach - she could still be alive today
They said Bronwen experienced a devastating injustice in her care and was treated with a blanket approach which had little effect on improving her mental health
Since the tragedy, Bronwen's family have set up Bronwen's Wish, a charity which aims to provide safe spaces for young people experiencing challenges with their mental health
It aims to provide wellbeing pods in primary and secondary schools which will act as quiet, relaxing and safe places for pupils who want to talk about their mental health
In June, Haydn and his dog Celog plan to walk the entire Pembrokeshire coastal path in one go - the equivalent distance to climbing Everest - to raise money for Bronwen's Wish
To donate to the challenge, dubbed 'Man and Mutt climb Everest', please go here
It'll take three weeks in all as I have arthritis in both knees so I'll likely need some rest days
We'll use a few campsites along the way, do some wild camping and hopefully a night on the sofa halfway around
I know Bron will be in my thoughts the whole time
A full inquest into Bronwen's death is set to take place between May 23 and 25 and the family are making a complaint against Cardiff and Vale University Health Board for failures in her care
A spokeswoman for the health board said: Our thoughts are with the family and friends of Bronwen at this incredibly sad time
An investigation report has been shared with the family and we reiterate the offer for a further meeting to discuss the findings

Craig Cambridge, 51, saw his life spiralling downwards after his daughter, Leah, died following a botched Brazilian butt lift in 2018 and tragically took his own life A dad took his own life after his daughter died following a botched Brazilian butt lift operation in Turkey
Craig Cambridge, 51, found his life spiralling downwards after his 29-year-old daughter Leah Cambridge died following a 2018 operation in Turkey that went wrong
The dad was tragically found dead at his home in Leeds and an inquest has found how he had never been able to get over Leah’s awful death
On the day he died, he had tried to ring doctors three times before his death but they had been closed because it was a bank holiday, Leeds Live reports
After an investigation into his death, senior coroner Kevin McLoughlin said he would be contacting the surgeon who botched Leah’s operation
Craig struggled with alcohol dependency and depression after his daughter’s tragic death, Wakefield Coroners' Court heard
On April, 5, 2021, his daughter's partner found Craig dead in his loft
This came nearly three years after Leah died in Izmir, Turkey, in August 2018
She died from a pulmonary embolism after Dr Ali Uckan accidentally injected fat into her veins
Leah had three heart attacks at the operating table
Mr McLoughlin conducted the inquests for the dad and daughter and said he wanted to let Dr Ali Uckan know the damage his surgery caused
He said to Craig's daughters Hayley and Chelsea and ex-partner Theresa Hall: Normally I am quite detached and hard-hearted about inquests, but when I saw another tragedy had befallen your family, I felt quite grievous
Having conducted the inquest into Leah all those years ago, I was incensed that the surgeon in Turkey stood well clear
I am proposing to send the report to the surgeon to make him aware of the tentacles of this
I am intending to send it to the medical authorities in Turkey to make them aware of how a tragedy manifests itself years later
I feel dreadfully sorry for you as a family
Chelsea and her partner had gone to see him on April 5, 2021, but when they were unable to get in, Chelsea’s partner ended up climbing through a window
What is happening where you live? Find out by adding your postcode
It was then he found the body of the former personal trainer and called paramedics
Craig was tragically pronounced dead at 7:50pm that evening
He had left notes for both his daughters
Craig had a history of depression and anxiety that became much worse after Leah’s death
He had been on medication and turned to alcohol and was under the care of a community mental health team
Police also found that the morning he took his own life he had tried to call doctors three times, but they were closed because it was a bank holiday
Dr Uckan did speak at Leah's inquest, where he called the operation a guessing game, speaking to Leah's widower Scott
Mr McLoughlin branded the surgeon a coward back in 2019 for not answering her family's questions
The coroner said that he had written to the doctor eight times since to ask him to give evidence at Craig's inquest - but got no response
As he returned a verdict of suicide today, Mr McLoughlin said: I am reliant upon on the pathologist for the cause of death, which in this case is hanging
This was a suicide attributed in part to the death of his daughter who died in surgery in Turkey

Damilya Jussipaliyeva's boyfriend sent the revenge porn to a friend and threatened to show it to her family - coroner's court heard she was in a 'disturbed state' before taking her own life A business student whose boyfriend shared a revenge porn film of her with a friend took her own life in a disturbed state, a coroner has found
Damilya Jussipaliyeva, 21, plunged 80ft to her death a week after Alessio Bianchi sent the video of her performing a sex act on him in a phone booth to a friend
Alessio, 30, was so angered by her spreading rumours about him he had threatened to show her family the clip and said he would also send them footage of her taking cocaine
Damilya left a suicide note which read: Alessio I love you, sorry
Another said: Mommy and Daddy I'm sorry
Hours before her death, Damilya and Alessio had fought outside his flat and he pushed her into a fountain, Inner West London Coroner's Court heard
Recording a narrative verdict, assistant coroner Bernard Richmond said: This is a tragic case
Her mind was plainly disturbed and in that state she formed an intention to kill herself
Electronic devices showed she had been searching for methods of suicides, terraces and heights, the inquest heard
There had been a rapid deterioration in her mental health in the last few days, the coroner said
She was in a very disturbed state immediately prior to her death
The coroner confirmed Damilya's injuries were consistent with a fall from a great height
He said there were no injuries, indicative of assault or restraint by a third party
The coroner said Damilya had suffered stress, depression and anxiety due to a number if factors, including her relationship with her family, her own drug and alcohol use, difficulties in coping with her degree course and her relationship with her boyfriend
The coroner described how Damilya had tried to take her own life twice before and was stopped from doing so
She said that by June 1, 2017 the student's mental state had significantly deteriorated
Shortly before she died at 1
20am, Damilya's mind was plainly disturbed and in that state she formed that intention to kill herself evidenced by goodbye notes to her parents and partner
Alessio, who was born in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia and Damilya, who was from Kazakhstan, had been in an on-off relationship for two-and-a-half years
They met at Regent's University in 2017 where they were both studying business
Alessio said: She was a sweet girl.  We had similar personalities.  We had similar backgrounds
The couple's friends were aware of their tumultuous relationship and Alessio had reported her to police himself on several occasions, when she had scratched him and she had attempted suicide
He told the inquest he had prevented a suicide attempt by Ms in September 2016
The court heard they were both using drugs, including cocaine, cannabis and ketamine, as well as alcohol
She was sent a video recording on WhatsApp of her in the phone booth in north London, on May 25, 2017
Attached was a message saying: I am going to keep destroying you
One of her friends received the same clip from three different numbers, with one containing the threat: I will f**k you up next, my love
Alessio claimed she had been spreading rumours about him and he sent the sex video to make her stop

Richard Farquhar, 61 - who murdered his wife in a jealous rage over an affair - took his own life after his release from prison was stalled and he was suspended from his charity shop job A murderer who killed his wife after discovering she was having an affair later took his own life in jail
Richard Farquhar became depressed about the possibility of delaying his release and after losing his prison placement at a charity shop
The 61-year-old was being held in HMP Greenock, in Inverclyde, Scotland, and, nearing the end of his sentence, had been moved to less restrictive procedures, including being given the new job
But he was suspended after his placement supervisor began to feel increasingly uncomfortable, according to a sheriff's report
Farquhar's mental health started to deteriorate after prison chiefs stopped moves to prepare him for release
A fatal accident inquiry was held virtually at the town’s sheriff court, with submissions made in February
Sheriff Andrew McIntyre issued a judgement in relation to the inmate's death on March 14, 2019
The determination was published earlier this month
Mr McIntyre said Farquhar died at 1am at Inverclyde Royal Hospital as a result of an injury sustained within a cell between 3
30pm and 4pm on March 13
Mr Farquhar’s death did not result from an accident, he added
The killer was sentenced to life with a minimum of 12 years for the murder of wife Anne in 2008 on the A90 road near Aberdeen, Scotland
The High Court in Edinburgh heard how she had kicked him out of their home in Cove Bay, Aberdeenshire, after she discovered he was having an affair with her friend
Anne then began seeing the same woman's husband and Farquhar stabbed her to death
Mr McIntyre said officials failed to provide him with detailed plans on what he needed to do to work towards his release or on how to access sessions with a psychologist
He concluded that if these actions had been taken the inmate's death may have been avoided
He said: I have found that Mr Farquhar committed suicide following a decline in his mental health contributed to by his suspension from a community placement
I have found that in the days and weeks prior to his death his imminent risk of suicide could not have been detected
I have also found that, as a result of the systems of working in place within HMP Greenock, and as a result of certain other factors, opportunities to safeguard Mr Farquhar’s mental wellbeing in the period before his death were missed
In particular I have found that: delay, a lack of joined-up working, and insufficient communication with Mr Farquhar, all contributed to him becoming distressed by his lack of progress, and to opportunities to avert that distress being missed
What crimes have been reported in your neighbourhood? Check with In Your Area
I find that those omissions contributed to his death
I find no cause for criticism of any of the professionals involved; it has only been possible to identify how things could have been done differently with the benefit of hindsight
I have made recommendations which I believe, if implemented, might realistically prevent other deaths in similar circumstances
The sheriff recommended several new guidelines for dealing with prisoners before release

He said: I have found that Mr Farquhar committed suicide following a decline in his mental health contributed to by his suspension from a community placement
I have found that in the days and weeks prior to his death his imminent risk of suicide could not have been detected
I have also found that, as a result of the systems of working in place within HMP Greenock, and as a result of certain other factors, opportunities to safeguard Mr Farquhar’s mental wellbeing in the period before his death were missed
In particular I have found that: delay, a lack of joined-up working, and insufficient communication with Mr Farquhar, all contributed to him becoming distressed by his lack of progress, and to opportunities to avert that distress being missed

I find that those omissions contributed to his death
I find no cause for criticism of any of the professionals involved; it has only been possible to identify how things could have been done differently with the benefit of hindsight
I have made recommendations which I believe, if implemented, might realistically prevent other deaths in similar circumstances
The sheriff recommended several new guidelines for dealing with prisoners before release

Richard Jeavons, 37, was found dead in the living room of his home in Chelmsley Wood, West Midlands - police tried to save his life, but CPR efforts failed to revive him A dad-of-four tragically took his own life after a series of mental health struggles and drug misuse, an inquest heard
Richard Jeavons, 37, was found dead in the living room of his home in Chelmsley Wood, West Midlands, on December 2
He had penned heartfelt notes to his boys and parents before his death
Police tried to save his life, but CPR efforts failed to revive him, Birmingham Live reports
Richard, a Birmingham-born electrician, was struggling after sad news he would no longer be able to see his children after a dangerous driving conviction
He was given the news as he was handed a two-year community order for theft, attempted theft, assault and dangerous driving in September last year
He was told he could not have contact until his sons turned 18, banned from driving for 18 months and ordered to pay £200 compensation alongside a £100 fine
Assistant Coroner Rebecca Ollivere recorded a verdict of suicide as the inquest concluded at Birmingham Coroner's Court on Tuesday, April 19
The inquest heard how he was suffering from emotionally unstable personality disorder, substance misuse, ADHD and drug-related psychotic symptoms
When he was first referred to the early intervention service at Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Trust in 2018, he had been motivated to engage
Miss Ollivere told the court: He struggled with his mental health and substance misuse
He also had a history of various suicide attempts over the years and he had ADHD
Richard was referred to the early intervention service, and he remained with them for three years
It became apparent during this time that his psychosis was not related to a specific mental health condition, but was due to his misuse of drugs
He was discharged into the community and allocated a care coordinator
But over the summer of 2021, he became very unstable and he was added to the waiting list for a hospital bed
While awaiting a bed, his mental state improved and after further review, it was decided it was no longer required, the assistant coroner continued
In September, he received upsetting news that he was no longer going to be able to have contact with his children
However, by November, his mental state had improved somewhat and he was engaging with services
Losing contact with his children led to Richard increasing his substance misuse and suffering from low moods
However, he was trying to engage with the services by attending cycling groups and narcotics anonymous
He managed to reduce his substance misuse and on December 1, he called his care coordinator, Geraldine Avis, to discuss his future
Richard was even humorous as he spoke of plans to go into town and get a job, get fit for the summer, buy a car and obtain a bus pass, she told the inquest
He gave no indication that he would harm himself, the court heard
But within hours, police officers were called to his Birmingham home - where he was sadly found dead alongside two suicide notes for his children and parents
The assistant coroner added: Later that night, officers were called to Richard's address after reports of a male with a knife
Sadly when officers gained entry to the property, they found him in his living room and despite CPR being attempted, sadly he could not be revived
No care or service delivery problems or missed opportunities were found in his care, a root cause analysis concluded

Child poverty charity The Childhood Trust today revealed how children have been impacted by the ongoing cost of living crisis - being left having self-harming and suicidal thoughts due to money worries Children are having suicidal thoughts because of the cost of living crisis, a report found
Britain is facing a ­humanitarian crisis on our doorsteps with children self-harming and unable to sleep because of money worries
Child poverty charity The Childhood Trust has today released a 33-page report into the effect the crisis is having on disadvantaged youngsters
They are warning millions of children are at breaking point
One little girl said she watches telly to try to forget her hunger
Laura, seven, of London, said: I ask my mother if we’ve any food and she’ll tell me if there’s enough money
If there isn’t then I just go in the cupboards and see if there’s something
If there’s a snack, I’ll eat it and try to go to bed
Tomorrow she might have more money
Another girl said: My mum was trying to pay for the electricity and we didn’t really have enough.  I felt really sad
It was really cold and I was really scared because the heater wasn’t working
The research by the Childhood Trust involved 1,468 parents, some to people aged over 18, with a third saying their children had been affected by the crisis
Of these 483 parents, nearly half said their kids are stressed, and a fifth said they smile less now
Nearly one in 10 reported children who have started self-harming while 8% said their kids have displayed suicidal tendencies
The Childhood Trust is aiming to raise £3
5million to help ­those in need
Chief executive Laurence ­Guinness said: It’s only thanks to donors and the thousands of ­charities supporting children that we aren’t facing a humanitarian crisis on our own doorsteps.  Donate at: championsforchildren. childhoodtrust. org

Daryl McWilliam, 24, was found dead in his hotel room after drunkenly texting his girlfriend of 12 months that he didn't want to 'be with her anymore' An amazing 24-year-old dad took his own life after splitting up with his girlfriend during a weekend away in Blackpool
An inquest heard Daryl McWilliam had travelled to the seaside resort with his girlfriend of 12 months, Natalie Jones
The couple, from Kilmarnock, Scotland, visited Wetherspoons for something to eat before returning to their room at Garvey's Promenade Hotel on Saturday February 26
The pair then decided to go back out and visit three pubs in Blackpool town centre, Lancs Live reports
Towards the end of the night, it is reported that Daryl, 24, became increasingly intoxicated and, after becoming separated from Natalie, he sent her a text saying: I don't want to be with you anymore
Shocked at this, Natalie then made several attempts to contact Daryl who eventually returned to the hotel at around midnight
The couple had an argument, during which Daryl damaged Natalie's phone and other belongings in the room, before she started to pack her things into their car
When Natalie went back to the room, Daryl wasn't there, and so she went downstairs to the bar to look for him
A short while later Natalie went back up to the room where she found Daryl unconscious
Paramedics and police were called but despite extensive resuscitation efforts Daryl was pronounced dead at 1. 37am on February 27
The cause of death was given as hanging
An inquest at Blackpool Town Hall today (Tuesday July 19) heard that Daryl, a pipe-fitter at Kilmaurs engineering firm A&L Mechanical Installations, had no history of mental health issues
He had visited the GP with his mum in 2020 for help with low mood but he was not known to the community mental health team
The content of the messages sent by Daryl indicate he was intoxicated
This tragic incident would appear to have stemmed from the breakdown of the relationship on a night which involved alcohol consumption
Assistant Coroner Louise Rae returned a conclusion of suicide
She said: Daryl McWilliam was on holiday in Blackpool with his partner
Following an argument she returned to the room to find him hanging
He was not known to mental health services
I agree this was a tragic incident which stemmed from the breakdown of a relationship
In terms of the evidence. .
I don't believe anybody could have acted sooner
It is difficult to find any conclusion other than suicide. .
I am therefore satisfied that the only conclusion possible and the one that I reach is the short-form conclusion of suicide
A fundraiser launched after Daryl's death, to help his parents Heather and John pay for the funeral, raised more than £2,200
Daryl's girlfriend Natalie paid tribute to him after his death, as reported by the Daily Record, in which she described him as the most amazing person she had ever known
She added: You showed me what true love actually is
I will always love you Daryl
I really wish I had gotten more time with you and got to do everything we planned on
You never failed to make me smile whenever I felt down and I can’t thank you enough for how happy you made me

Local police in France have said that John Boyes, 63, hit his wife with a baseball bat before strangling her, then he hung himself but his family dispute the prosecutors account of events A British family has disputed the account of French police saying that a husband beat his wife with a baseball bat and strangled her before hanging himself
John Boyes and his wife Kathryn were discovered dead at their home in the Pyrenees
Local French police said that the 63-year-old British marathon champion beat his wife to a grisly death with a baseball bat before he took his own life
Officers claimed their idyllic life in France, where they ran a retreat while 65-year-old Kathryn worked as an artist, was a front for deeper issues
They said the couple, originally from Bournemouth, was experiencing financial difficulties because of a suicide note written on a computer
The couple had been dead for some time when police found them
But John’s brother, Robert, dismissed the murder-suicide theory
He said he spoke to his brother every Sunday and that he had never mentioned any issues with his marriage or money
Talking to The Times, he said: When I first heard they had died I assumed they were victims of a robbery because their house is in a remote area
I want the police to carry out a full investigation and not assume John killed Kath
John was a well-known long distance runner in the 1980s and combined a career in the Royal Mail with his athletics where he won marathons across the world
Him and Kathryn, who worked at Barclays bank in Southampton, met during a running camp in Lanzarote and the pair moved to France in 2004
They ran a specialised retreat for runners and cyclists and had guests included Steve Wray, the British 100km record-holder, and Chris Boardman, the Olympic gold-medal winning cyclist
Robert said that two years ago the couple found maintaining the five acre property too difficult so decided to retire
They sold up and retired to a smaller property nearby in Boudrac
Robert said that they both had their work pensions and were not far off claiming their state pensions as well
He added he couldn’t imagine his brother murdering his sister-in-law and said they had had a wonderful life in France
He also dismissed reports they had run out of money converting the house into holiday accommodation
After two weeks of not hearing anything from his brother, Robert became concerned and a friend, who was due to go cycling with John, discovered their bodies last Sunday
John’s Stava account showed that as recently as April 12 he completed a 3. 6mile run
The local prosecutor Christophe Amunzateguy said the John had hit his wife with a baseball bat before he strangled her
He then went into an annexe and hung himself, they said

Kiena Dawes, from Fleetwood, Lancashire, was pronounced dead at the scene after being struck by a train in Garstang, with her devastated brother saying she was in such a bad place A young mum with a nine-month-old baby died after being hit by a train
Named by grieving friends and family as Kiena Dawes, from Fleetwood, Lancashire, she was killed on the Preston to Lancaster line on Friday afternoon
The 23-year-old hairdresser was pronounced dead at the scene in Garstang by paramedics, reports LancsLive
Her brother Kynan Dawes said she was in such a bad place in her head and took the decision to end what was an awful battle in her life
Kiena leaves her daughter Marnie Blu Dawes and Kynan has pledged to give up his job as a builder to take care of her
A GoFundMe page has been set up by Matthew Sanderson to support Kynan and Marnie and pay towards Kiena's funeral costs
It has already raised more than £8,500 against its £2,500 goal
Writing on the GoFundMe page, Matthew said: This is Marnie and her mummy, Marnie is only 9 months old and recently lost her mummy to a tragic suicide
Marnie is now being cared for by her uncle Kynan
Kynan has promised to be there for Marnie through thick and thin as he struggles to deal with the loss of his sister in such tragic circumstances
Kynan has also had to give up his employment as a builder to take care of Marnie which has already had a significant impact on Kynan’s finances
We are asking people not to let Kynan struggle alone
Please support Kynan so he can get a deposit to rent a house, buy some essentials for Marnie and pay towards his sisters funeral
Any excess funds will be placed in trust for Marnie once she turns 18
Thanks again and thanks for your support
It’s ok not to be ok! Please talk to someone and don’t suffer in silence
Kiena, who was living in Fleetwood but originally from St Annes, went missing on Friday (July 22) and Kynan launched an 'urgent' appeal on social media to help find her
Within hours they received the devastating news that Kiena had died after being hit by a train
Friends said Kiena's mental health had been severely impacted
Four days before her death she posted a picture on Facebook with her dad saying: 2 years ago today you took your last breathe.
hope you stay with me through this nightmare I’m living and I will remember to have the strength you always did
Wish you were here, love you forever and a day dad
Writing on Facebook, Kynan said: We love you more than words can ever say! I’m going to miss you more than you’ll ever have known
You didn’t deserve this! And you will be remembered by everyone
I’ll make sure your baby girl will be looked after and grow up to know how perfect you really was

But I will make sure I look after Marnie and she will grow up to be the most perfect little girl
Just as you would have wanted.  RIP BEAUTIFUL

Kiena leaves her daughter Marnie Blu Dawes and Kynan has pledged to give up his job as a builder to take care of her
A GoFundMe page has been set up by Matthew Sanderson to support Kynan and Marnie and pay towards Kiena's funeral costs
It has already raised more than £8,500 against its £2,500 goal
Writing on the GoFundMe page, Matthew said: This is Marnie and her mummy, Marnie is only 9 months old and recently lost her mummy to a tragic suicide
Marnie is now being cared for by her uncle Kynan
Kynan has promised to be there for Marnie through thick and thin as he struggles to deal with the loss of his sister in such tragic circumstances
Kynan has also had to give up his employment as a builder to take care of Marnie which has already had a significant impact on Kynan’s finances
We are asking people not to let Kynan struggle alone
Please support Kynan so he can get a deposit to rent a house, buy some essentials for Marnie and pay towards his sisters funeral
Any excess funds will be placed in trust for Marnie once she turns 18
Thanks again and thanks for your support
It’s ok not to be ok! Please talk to someone and don’t suffer in silence
Kiena, who was living in Fleetwood but originally from St Annes, went missing on Friday (July 22) and Kynan launched an 'urgent' appeal on social media to help find her
Within hours they received the devastating news that Kiena had died after being hit by a train
Friends said Kiena's mental health had been severely impacted
Four days before her death she posted a picture on Facebook with her dad saying: 2 years ago today you took your last breathe.
hope you stay with me through this nightmare I’m living and I will remember to have the strength you always did
Wish you were here, love you forever and a day dad
Writing on Facebook, Kynan said: We love you more than words can ever say! I’m going to miss you more than you’ll ever have known
You didn’t deserve this! And you will be remembered by everyone
I’ll make sure your baby girl will be looked after and grow up to know how perfect you really was

Responding to the GoFundMe appeal, Kynan said: This is absolutely amazing my family and little Marnie appreciate this so much

I still can’t believe your gone Kiena
But I will make sure I look after Marnie and she will grow up to be the most perfect little girl
Just as you would have wanted.  RIP BEAUTIFUL
Friends and family have paid tribute on social media and well-wishers have been leaving flowers on railings in Carlyle Avenue, Blackpool, opposite the home of Kiena's mother

Kiena Dawes, 23, asked the police for help just weeks before she left her nine-month-old daughter with a close friend and took her own life, with Lancashire Constabulary referring itself to a police watchdog An alleged domestic abuse victim and mum of-one who tragically killed herself on train tracks was let down by the police, her family have claimed today
Kiena Dawes, 23, had left her nine-month-old daughter, Marnie, with a close friend just hours before she was hit by a train and pronounced dead at the scene last Friday
The tragedy happened 11 days after she was allegedly assaulted by a man who her family said she should have been protected from by the police
In a touching tribute, her brother, Kynan, 29, called Kiena an amazing young girl and said that the bubbly mum had just wanted a happy life
But he also revealed shocking new photos showing her looking bloodied and bruised following an alleged assault after police had fitted panic alarms in her home
Speaking today, Kynan blasted Lancashire Constabulary after it emerged the force had referred itself to a police watchdog due to their contact with Kiena before her death
The builder from Blackpool, Lancs, said: The police have let my sister down
They did not do enough
The head of CID is going to go through everything with a toothpick
They're going to find out why nothing happened, and why it got to the point where she felt she wasn't being looked after by the service, which she should be, and decided to take her life
She had panic alarms fitted in her house and a panic alarm fitted around her neck
My sister left a note before she killed herself, on her phone
The facts why she killed herself are stated in that note
In time, that may get shared but not now
He added: The girl was very, very well loved
She never said a bad word about anybody
She just wanted to live a happy little life
Kiena's body was recovered from train tracks near the town of Garstang, Lancs, as friends and family conducted a frantic search for her in nearby streets and alleyways
But before they could locate the missing 23-year-old, they got the terrible news that her body had been found on a rail line just after 1pm, on Friday
Kynan claimed the young woman had sought the help of police roughly five weeks earlier, following allegations that she'd been assaulted on multiple occasions
He said Lancashire Police had fitted her home with a panic alarm and given her a special neckless that had a button she could press if she felt like she was in danger
But Kynan said this hadn't stop her attacker coming to her home on July 11, before he allegedly split her head open, leaving her completely traumatised
And he said the local police should have done more to help her as she attempted to bring her alleged attacker to court
He said: The police have let my sister down, they have
She wanted to go through the legal route to get justice
The girl is dead now, but it should have gone to CPS ages ago
She didn't want to live a life the way she was living, so she ended it
Kynan said his sister had spent her early life growing up in Cyprus before moving to the UK, and later settling in Fleetwood, Lancs
He said she had then trained as a hairdresser and began working at a local shop and had absolutely loved her job
He said: Kiena was the most amazing little girl from when she was first born
She was very bubbly, very nice.  We moved to Cyprus
She used to speak fluent Greek
She had loads of friends in Cyprus
And then we moved back to the UK as my dad had an accident, which did knock her.  She was a hairdresser
She used to work at Rory Blair in Fleetwood
She absolutely loved her job, she was really good at it
She loved having a tan
She would go on the sun beds all the time
All the sun bed shops have been in touch saying, 'We'll miss her, she used to come in
' She was just amazing
A spokesperson for British Transport Police confirmed that Kiena had passed away on a train line and added that they were not treating the death as suspicious

Gaia Pope-Sutherland's was worried about the imminent release from prison of a man she had accused of raping her and her mental health was suffering, an inquest heard A missing teenager had feared she was pregnant days before her death, an inquest heard today
Gaia Pope-Sutherland, 19, was reported missing from her home in Swanage, Dorset on November 7, 2017
Her body was found 11 days later in the undergrowth
Dorset Coroner's Court heard that Gaia's mental health was suffering due to worries about the imminent release from prison of a man she had accused of raping her
She had also recently split up with her boyfriend and had been sent indecent images on social media, the inquest heard
Gaia, who suffered from severe epilepsy and post-traumatic stress disorder, had been experiencing ongoing manic episodes in the weeks before her disappearance, it was said
Forensic pathologist Dr Russell Delaney told the hearing her naked body was found in deep undergrowth and that she had died from hypothermia
Gaia's clothing was found scattered across a field as if she had been removing it as she walked
Dr Delaney said told the hearing at the time of her disappearance she had recently split from her boyfriend and had become convinced she was pregnant, even though a test was negative
He said there was no medical evidence she was pregnant at the time of her death
Gaia had been due to see the GP for an appointment at 5pm the day she vanished
Dr Delaney said the day she disappeared the teen left her aunt's home at about 3
40pm and went to a friend's where she was behaving irrationally and began undressing
Gaia redressed but left without her coat, and the last known sighting of her was a few minutes later
Dr Delaney said the post-mortem examination found no signs of trauma, but there was evidence of Wischnewski spots in the lining of her stomach - a sign of hypothermia
The pathologist said there were several possibilities why Gaia had undressed before her death
It is possible Gaia was suffering from paradoxical undressing - where she thought she was overheating and removed her clothing
Another possibility could have been her declining mental health
He said: It is possible she was undressed because of her deteriorating mental health and that has made her vulnerable to hypothermia
The deterioration of her mental health has led to her being outside, and cold and wet, and led to her becoming more confused with hypothermia
The undressing is typical of paradoxical undressing and hypothermia
She also had minor cuts to her feet and shins, consistent with walking through gorse and brambles while not wearing shoes or socks
Dr Delaney described a condition called hide and die where someone suffering from hypothermia burrows into a closed space
Gaia, who used cannabis and ecstasy, was prescribed medication to treat up to five seizures a day, but Dr Delaney could not be sure she had suffered one before her death
He said: I am certain that hypothermia has made a significant contribution to her death
It is significant to explain her death alone
It could have acted in concert with epilepsy
In the absence of anyone witnessing the seizure, there isn't a way of determining to a significant degree of certainty that someone has had a seizure immediately prior to death
Dr Delaney said he believed Gaia had died a number of days before her body was found but was unable to say exactly when
He said: I would always urge caution by trying to be too specific and narrow the time frame down too much
Research entomologist Martin Hall has previously told the inquest that having examined blowfly larvae recovered from the teenager's body he believed the latest she was alive was November 9

Craig Murray was found dead at Etherow Country Park in Stockport two years ago but his wife Jade believes he should have received better support from mental health services A heartbroken wife has shared her grief after her husband killed himself in the same park where he had proposed to her
Craig Murray had asked his wife Jade to marry him at Etherow Country Park in Stockport, where he was found dead in 2020
The 41-year-old, who had a long history of mental health problems, had only been married for 18 months when he died
Craig had been working as a car salesman at a local dealership prior to his death on May 23, 2020
Two years on Jade, 39, says she is still struggling to come to terms with what happened
She hopes that by sharing her story, mental health services can provide better for those that are struggling
Jade said in quotes reported by the Manchester Evening News : It’s more than two years since I lost Craig and it’s still incredibly difficult to come to terms with the fact he’s no longer here
We had only been married 18 months when he died
Craig’s mental illness was putting a strain on our relationship, but I believe that with the correct treatment Craig would have recovered and we would have spent the rest of our lives together
It devastates me that this won’t happen
Craig had suffered from mental illness since 2013 and in 2019 his health deteriorated again when he developed psychosis and paranoia, as well as delusions and low mood
He was placed under the care of Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust's Access Team and Community Health Team (CMHT), before being referred to the Home Treatment Team in January 2020
He remained under the care of the CMHT and HMT until his death four months later
During this time, he took a number of overdoses
Jade, a bank business manager, said: When his mental health began to deteriorate, he began thinking he was in danger and that people were following him
He moved in with his mum just before lockdown as he kept saying he thought I was also in danger and that our home security was being hacked
It was awful and I kept pleading with him not to do anything stupid
To this day, I still have so many questions over Craig’s death and whether more could have been done to help him
I hope that by sharing my story it will highlight the devastating effects that the lack of appropriate support for loved ones with mental health problems can have
After an inquest in December 2020 highlighted issues in the care provided to Craig, his widow instructed medical negligence experts at Irwin Mitchell to investigate her husband’s care under the Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust
She is joining with her legal team marked World Suicide Prevention Day this month by speaking out on her loss and to help raise awareness around mental illness
What is happening where you live? Find out by adding your postcode
Margaret Ryan, the specialist medical negligence lawyer at Irwin Mitchell representing Jade, said: Craig’s family remain devastated by what’s happened and his son, who was 15 years old at the time, is now without a father
Sadly, the inquest into Craig’s death highlighted issues in the care provided to him in the lead up to his death
We’re now investigating this and will continue to support Jade however we can
Clare Parker, director of nursing, healthcare professionals and quality governance at Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust, said: Our deepest sympathies are with Craig Murray’s family
Our own investigation supported the findings of the coroner
The Covid pandemic meant that we had to rapidly change the way our teams worked and we accepted that a lack of face-to-face contact was a missed opportunity to reassess Mr Murray

Get email updates with the day's biggest stories Craig Murray was found dead at Etherow Country Park in Stockport two years ago but his wife Jade believes he should have received better support from mental health services A heartbroken wife has shared her grief after her husband killed himself in the same park where he had proposed to her
Craig Murray had asked his wife Jade to marry him at Etherow Country Park in Stockport, where he was found dead in 2020
The 41-year-old, who had a long history of mental health problems, had only been married for 18 months when he died
Craig had been working as a car salesman at a local dealership prior to his death on May 23, 2020
Two years on Jade, 39, says she is still struggling to come to terms with what happened
She hopes that by sharing her story, mental health services can provide better for those that are struggling
Jade said in quotes reported by the Manchester Evening News : It’s more than two years since I lost Craig and it’s still incredibly difficult to come to terms with the fact he’s no longer here
We had only been married 18 months when he died
Craig’s mental illness was putting a strain on our relationship, but I believe that with the correct treatment Craig would have recovered and we would have spent the rest of our lives together
It devastates me that this won’t happen
Craig had suffered from mental illness since 2013 and in 2019 his health deteriorated again when he developed psychosis and paranoia, as well as delusions and low mood
He was placed under the care of Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust's Access Team and Community Health Team (CMHT), before being referred to the Home Treatment Team in January 2020
He remained under the care of the CMHT and HMT until his death four months later
During this time, he took a number of overdoses
Jade, a bank business manager, said: When his mental health began to deteriorate, he began thinking he was in danger and that people were following him
He moved in with his mum just before lockdown as he kept saying he thought I was also in danger and that our home security was being hacked
It was awful and I kept pleading with him not to do anything stupid
To this day, I still have so many questions over Craig’s death and whether more could have been done to help him
I hope that by sharing my story it will highlight the devastating effects that the lack of appropriate support for loved ones with mental health problems can have
After an inquest in December 2020 highlighted issues in the care provided to Craig, his widow instructed medical negligence experts at Irwin Mitchell to investigate her husband’s care under the Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust
She is joining with her legal team marked World Suicide Prevention Day this month by speaking out on her loss and to help raise awareness around mental illness

Margaret Ryan, the specialist medical negligence lawyer at Irwin Mitchell representing Jade, said: Craig’s family remain devastated by what’s happened and his son, who was 15 years old at the time, is now without a father
Sadly, the inquest into Craig’s death highlighted issues in the care provided to him in the lead up to his death
We’re now investigating this and will continue to support Jade however we can
Clare Parker, director of nursing, healthcare professionals and quality governance at Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust, said: Our deepest sympathies are with Craig Murray’s family
Our own investigation supported the findings of the coroner
The Covid pandemic meant that we had to rapidly change the way our teams worked and we accepted that a lack of face-to-face contact was a missed opportunity to reassess Mr Murray
We are very sorry this did not happen

Chloe Barber, of Driffield, East Yorkshire, was bullied at school, self-harmed and eventually took her own life at home in November last year
Her mum has shared her grief A devastated mother has shared her grief after her teenage daughter was found hanged at the family home
Kirsten Barber said Chloe Barber, 18, fell through the cracks of the mental health system after several stays in psychiatric hospitals
Her brother Reece Barber, 15, discovered Chloe unresponsive and, though her called 999 and gave Chloe CPR, the teenager was pronounced dead at the home in Driffield, East Yorkshire
Speaking today, grief-stricken Kirsten said Chloe struggled after being diagnosed with unstable personality disorder
She told Hull Live : You know when people say they’re heartbroken? This is heartbroken
When you split up with your boyfriend and stuff like that you think you know heartbreak.  But this is heartbreak
Anyone who is able to can donate to Kirsten's JustGiving page for their Three Peaks challenge for Chloe here
There are times when I just want to tell Chloe something, like when our dogs have done something daft and then you remember you can’t
But I know she’s still here
I had Covid last month and the worst thing about it was losing my sense of smell
I went into her bedroom because I just go in there every so often to be near her, and I couldn’t smell her
The family had first noticed signs Chloe was struggling in 2017 when she was a victim of bullying at school
She also self-harmed as her condition deteriorated over the following years
On one occasion, Chloe didn't return to Mill Lodge Hospital in York after going for a walk
And in early 2021, the teenager was hospitalised at Cygnet Health Care where her problems with self harm became worse
It was at Cygnet where she also met friend Chelsea Blue Mooney, a teenager from Bridlington, North Yorkshire, who shortly later died while in the unit's care
Chloe was left devastated by 17-year-old Chelsea’s death in April last year
Kirsten continued: Mental health is an invisible killer
If someone’s got cancer or a broken leg you can physically see it and you can physically mend it
We still don’t know exactly what Chloe was going through
She was a very secretive person
Chloe took her own life in November last year
Kirsten is taking on the Yorkshire Three Peaks later this spring to raise cash for young suicide charity Papyrus
Figures released by the Office of National Statistics (ONS) this week show 587 people in Yorkshire & the Humber took their lives in 2021 - of which 419 were men or boys and 168 women or girls
Data suggests suicide figures did not rise during the pandemic, although have slowly risen over the past 10 years
And while suicide remains the biggest killer of young men, the number of female suicides has been insidiously creeping up in recent years
Papyrus supports young people affected by suicide and suicidal thoughts, and has seen a 25% increase in calls, texts and emails to its confidential HOPELINEUK service
In 2020 and 2021 at least one in every three contacts was from a child under the age of 18
Anyone who is able to can donate to Kirsten's JustGiving page for their Three Peaks challenge for Chloe here
A spokesperson from Humber Teaching NHS Foundation Trust, said: It is the position of the Trust that we do not comment on individual cases, as we prefer to discuss directly with the families who are affected

Brian Temple's mum described her son as happy go lucky but said the ordeal of incorrectly naming him as a paedophile caused him to become closed off and depressed An inquest heard how a man took his own life after police wrongly named him as a paedophile as a result of human error
Brian Temple was just 34-years-old when he died on December 31, 2017 - six months after being arrested on June 8 for allegedly stealing a pack of sausage rolls from Greggs
The inquest opened on Monday, June 20, and it heard that upon arriving home from custody, Mr Temple gave his release papers to his then-girlfriend, TeessideLive reports
Unbeknown to him, police had made an error in which they produced the wrong information on this document
The letter said he been in custody for inciting sexual relations with a 13-year-old girl, which he had not
Teesside Coroner's Court heard that Mr Temple's then-girlfriend began telling people of the incorrect information, which in turn caused people to lash out at the Redcar man
He was reportedly verbally abused in the street, attacked in his own home and hit around the head by a golf club
To deal with the onslaught he had experienced, the court heard Mr Temple began to drink heavily and take a mixture of both prescribed medication and recreational drugs, such as cocaine
Coroner Claire Bailey explained that a toxicology report carried out by Dr Cooper found Brian had 134mg of alcohol in his system
He was also found with a mixture of cocaine, Diazepam, Zopiclone and Pregablin - but these did not contribute to his death
Dr Cooper concluded that Mr Temple's death was as a result of hanging
His body was found by his brother Anthony, after his mum's partner, Paul Daley, became concerned that they had not heard from him all day
Coroner officer Nick Owen read statements from Mr Temple's brother Paul, sister in law Crystal and mum Mrs McLachlan, who has since passed away
His mum described her son as happy go lucky but admitted the ordeal with incorrect release papers caused him to become closed off and depressed
The court heard that after news spread of the release papers, Mr Temple reported threats and assaults to the police
The force's welfare checks reportedly made this worse and somewhat fuelled the fire of the incorrect rumours
His brother Paul, who was in attendance at the inquest at Teesside Magistrates Court, spoke of his closeness to his brother and how they'd grown up being anti-drug
Paul explained Mr Temple began taking drugs to cope with the constant attacks and assaults he was experiencing in the months leasing to his passing
Although he had depression, Paul said his brother never indicated suicidal tendencies and said the mistake on the release sheet would drive anyone mad

In her statement, Mr Temple's sister-in-law Crystal said the mistaken charge sheet was found in his pocket at the time of his death
She said she believed the police had a duty of care for vulnerable people such as her brother-in-law, as he was suffering from mental health issues at the time of his arrest
Officer Owen read out numerous statements from police officers who had dealt with Mr Temple in the run up to his death and around the time of his arrest and the incorrect papers being issued
Detective Sergeant Agar of Cleveland Police said in his statement that he had dealt with Mr Temple's complaint of the incorrect papers on November 28, 2017, and had said the bail sheet was a genuine human error
The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) began an investigation after Mr Temple's passing, so an error like this one would never happen again at Cleveland Police
They concluded that human error was the main judgement of the papers and this occurrence was incredibly unusual.  The inquest continues

WARNING DISTRESSING CONTENT: A mum who plunged to her death searched for the means of taking her own life the day before she did
Raquel Wilkins' death was ruled a murder-suicide A woman who calmly looked her boyfriend in the eye as she fell to her death off a balcony holding their son looked up easy suicide on Google before she died
Raquel Wilkins, 40, was killed with her two-year-old son Denzel Wilkins-Browning when she stepped off a high point of the Petco arena, a baseball stadium in downtown San Diego, California, in the US
The San Diego Police ruled her death on September 29 a murder -suicide after the six-storey fall killed both Raquel and Denzel
The family of Raquel contested the ruling and one witness said that while standing on a bench she again lost her balance and this time, fell over the edge
She had already been seen on the bench and nearly losing her balance
They added: From my vantage point, looking at her back, it was almost like she rolled over the railing
Her sudden decision to fall seemed odd as the pair were seen happy and laughing on the day and the family's attorney claimed the ruling was useful for the owners of the stadium, as reported by the San Diego Tribune
He claimed: The city of San Diego owns that ballpark, it is legally responsible, assuming that what caused her to fall was anything but her intent
The only way the city is not at fault is if she intended to kill herself and her baby
Lieutenant Andra Brown said the police had come to the murder-suicide conclusion after detectives conducted a thorough and comprehensive investigation that included dozens of interviews, reviewing of available video footage, and collecting background information to determine what led to the deaths
The boyfriend of Raquel contests the idea that her death was an accident and said it was very intentional, very planned
Christopher Browning said she all of a sudden stared straight at him with an eerie silence, like in a movie
It was so quick, so fast, he added to the New York Post
Both of them went over.  It was very quiet
I was in complete shock
Another witness backed up Christopher's claims in a police report and argued the act was completely intentional
Her demeanour walking up was so calm
She didn’t even look down
It looked just like she was trying to hop over a fence
Raquel's mental state in the months leading up to her death had reportedly deteriorated and had broken down in front of her boyfriend before
She had searched for tips for taking her own life on her phone the day before
To grieve in a healthy way, you have to honour the truth, Christopher said

Silvija Snipkute, 31, who was a mum-of-one and had five siblings, was described as the strongest person but tragically took her own life after she booked into a hotel room in London A loving young mum was found dead in her hotel room after staff noticed she hadn’t checked out
Silvija Snipkute was discovered dead by cleaning staff at the Bank Hotel in Barking, after she failed to check out that morning
An inquest heard how she tragically took her own life
After they noticed the 31-year-old’s door was locked, staff retrieved a key - but sadlt they found the young mum dead inside, around 11:30am on February 15, My London reported
Medics from the London Ambulance Service declared her dead at the scene
Met Police officers also attended the scene and were informed she had arrived the previous evening and was due to leave that morning
However, the mum had been reported missing when her partner Tomas notified police that she had failed to return home
An inquest heard how the mum had taken herself to a private space where she wouldn’t be interrupted to take her own life
An examination of CCTV showed that nobody else had entered her hotel room since she arrived at 9:49pm and her death was deemed non-suspicious
An inquest at Waltham Forest Coroners Court on June 6 heard that shortly after Silvija was discovered, officers were made aware that the woman in the room was identical to a woman who had been reported missing
A very sad note was found in her hotel room which Coroner Graeme Irvine said was a note of intent indicating that she had intended to take her own life
What is happening where you live? Find out by adding your postcode
A post-mortem examination found that Silvija, a warehouse operative from Dagenham, had no natural diseases, whilst a toxicology report found traces of alcohol and cocaine in her blood and urine
Mr Irvine said: It seems clear to me that Silvija did something that caused her own death, which was tying a ligature around her neck and hanging herself
It also appears to me that Silvija had taken herself to a place where she wouldn’t be interrupted, that would be private
There’s no indication from her actions that she was hoping someone would interrupt her or save her
I don’t think this was a cry for help
He continued: There is sufficient evidence to formulate a conclusion of suicide in this inquest
In a heartbreaking tribute to the mum, her sister-in-law Gabriella called her the strongest person she had known who was always helping others
She said: She was the eldest of five children
Silvija had a simple childhood although had several depression episodes as a teenager, nonetheless she continued to live and work in Lithuania
She moved to the UK several years ago
Living in London, she met her partner Tomas and her daughter was born from this union
Silvija always loved working and she was always helping others
She was a kind, loving mother, sister and friend
She was the strongest person we all ever knew but she heartbreakingly lost her battle with depression
Silvija will be forever remembered and loved by her mother, her siblings, her partner, her daughter and her friends
A GoFundMe to raise money for her family succeeded in raising over £3,000 after she died

Nathan Hunt's dad Derek says new evidence found his son - who served with Prince Harry - was deeply traumatised by a Taliban attack that killed and seriously wounded 10 Afghan soldiers The family of a war hero who served alongside Prince Harry claim new evidence shows that their son’s suicide was linked to combat service
Warrant Officer Nathan Hunt’s parents are campaigning to have his name added to the memorial at the National Arboretum in Staffordshire
So far defence chiefs have refused to budge on their ruling that his death was not linked to his service in Afghanistan 10 years before
Now the family have discovered he was deeply traumatised by a Taliban rocket attack which killed and seriously wounded up to 10 Afghan soldiers
The carnage happened in December 2007 during the ferocious battle for the town of Musa Qala in Helmand
The report states that Nathan and another soldier tried and failed to save the lives of Afghan soldiers
Nathan’s dad Derek, himself an Army veteran, said: I received this report last week and it shows beyond doubt that Nathan was seriously traumatised by the war
He had nightmares and was really struggling

Anyone who witnessed that sort of thing would be seriously affected by it
This seems to have been ignored by people who decided that Nathan should not have his name on the war memorial
Or, worse still, they had no idea this happened to Nathan
Nathan was found hanged at his home in Lincoln aged 39 on January 2, 2018, after developing PTSD
He left behind a young daughter
An inquest seven months later heard he had suffered nightmares as a result of dealing with Taliban bombs
A recently acquired transcript reveals that his ex-wife Lainey was convinced he had PTSD after returning from Afghanistan in 2008
But he refused to get help because he was fearful of the impact it might have on his promotion chances
Derek added: I will be taking this up with the new Veterans’ Minister Johnny Mercer when I meet with him next month
There is now so much evidence showing that Nathan was obviously in a bad way after he returned from Afghanistan
I just can’t understand why this has all been ignored

Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inbox Nathan Hunt's dad Derek says new evidence found his son - who served with Prince Harry - was deeply traumatised by a Taliban attack that killed and seriously wounded 10 Afghan soldiers The family of a war hero who served alongside Prince Harry claim new evidence shows that their son’s suicide was linked to combat service
Warrant Officer Nathan Hunt’s parents are campaigning to have his name added to the memorial at the National Arboretum in Staffordshire
So far defence chiefs have refused to budge on their ruling that his death was not linked to his service in Afghanistan 10 years before
Now the family have discovered he was deeply traumatised by a Taliban rocket attack which killed and seriously wounded up to 10 Afghan soldiers
The carnage happened in December 2007 during the ferocious battle for the town of Musa Qala in Helmand
The report states that Nathan and another soldier tried and failed to save the lives of Afghan soldiers
Nathan’s dad Derek, himself an Army veteran, said: I received this report last week and it shows beyond doubt that Nathan was seriously traumatised by the war
He had nightmares and was really struggling

Manchester United fan Robert Davies, 33, had been partying in Blackpool and joking with family in the days and weeks leading up to his death A photo of a dad-of-two taken weeks before he took his life shows the signs aren't always clear, his family has said
Manchester United fan Robert Davies, 33, had been partying in Blackpool and joking with family in the days and weeks leading up to his death
Now his mum and sisters want others to see the pictures of an outwardly happy young man to raise awareness
Speaking to WalesOnline bereft mother Rachel said her home in Crickhowell feels empty since Robert's death
His family says support was lacking throughout his struggles and that while he received treatment for alcohol addiction they were never given a direct line for a support worker
Rachel says she's also struggled to find bereavement support and has had to resort to Facebook community groups
Robert is described as fun-loving and as mischievous as anything
The only thing the popular window cleaner adored more than football and his team Manchester United were his family and friends
But on November 30 he took his life days after enjoying a holiday in Blackpool and sharing photos of his trip with his girlfriend on social media
At home with her seven cats, three dogs, and 14-year-old daughter, Rachel points to the corner of the room beside her which is now Robert’s corner
His ashes sit in the middle of ornamental robins, candles, and a small glass house which reads: Special son, your light will shine forever inside our broken hearts
Her lounge is crammed with pictures of him - some with his two children aged 10 and four
Robbie is here with me forever, Rachel, 52, said.  I do believe that
They always say when robins appear, loved ones are near
Life is empty here now, that’s how I’d describe it
The only joy I get is when my grandchildren come to stay
How do you carry on doing normal daily things when you feel your life has come to a halt? It’s just day by day, or even minute by minute sometimes
It’s the waking up in the morning when you forget for a second that he’s not here, that’s the worst part, she said
Flicking through countless photos of her son, she continued: I would genuinely say he was one of the happiest and most outgoing people for much of his life
A super-friendly person who would walk into a group of people he wouldn’t know and would come out with many friends
Rachel smiles and laughs as she recalls funny memories which she now cherishes more than ever
At his nan’s birthday party only days before he died he brought out a cake for her with candles that didn’t blow out
He found it hilarious watching her trying everything to get these candles to stop
That sums up the type of person he was
It also shows how anyone can find themselves at their lowest ebb within days and when their family might least expect it, she says
Even in the days prior to his death Robert’s relatives said he had appeared to be as happy as he’d been in a long time, and had even decided to take his girlfriend on holiday
A picture taken of Robert in Blackpool shows him the week before he took his life, and it’s a picture Rachel wants others to see
Looking at the photo, she explained: By that point I think he definitely was suffering mentally and he tried to mask it with drink
He’d often drink a bottle of vodka a day which I’d put water in without him knowing
But he did seem to have become better prior to his death
He did seem to have picked himself up and then he’d have a bad week where he’d be really down
His friends would often say how they felt he was getting there, but maybe he was putting on a show to make people think he was okay
I want others to be aware that there are not always clear signs
The story about his nan not being able to blow the candles out was days before he died
The photos in Blackpool were taken a week before
By the time of his death Robert had worked hard to build his window cleaning business in Brecon and enjoyed speaking with locals - particularly those older than himself
The older folk really loved him, he’d spend half the time having tea and coffee with them, Rachel went on
He came home telling us all about them and the stories he’d heard
He’d often sit with them during the lockdowns to keep them company
It does show it can happen to anyone and that’s the saddest part
People don’t think this will ever happen to them or to anyone they know
A year before he died he’d have been the person in my life I’d have worried about the least
When his mental health dipped in the spring of 2021 Robert moved back in with Rachel, and she says they spent his final months watching copious amounts of sport on the television, sometimes until the early hours of the morning, to occupy his mind
He became my little boy again, she recalled
The night before he died Robert had fallen asleep drunk on the sofa
Rachel rang the doctors the following morning after he had told her he felt he wanted to take his life
She says she still feels guilty that she didn’t call the emergency services, but she feels let down that she wasn’t prepared for that moment
She claims Robert wasn’t offered any support other than for his alcohol dependency, even though he’d sometimes told specialists that he wanted to take his life in the months before he died
I rang the doctors and they said they’d call me back, but by the time they rang me back an hour and a half later Robert was dead, Rachel said
Not only did Robert not get enough support but we as a family didn’t get the support we needed
If we’d had appropriate guidance we’d have known what to do when Robert told us he wanted to take his life
We were in contact with mental health specialists but we were never given a direct number to contact or guidance on what to do in that scenario
There was no face to face support during Covid either
Everything was done over the phone - even the counselling for Robert for his problems with alcohol which he started in the March [of 2021]
He needed face to face help
On the morning of his death Robert told his mum he was planning on driving away from the house when she went to drop off her grandson at school, to which Rachel told him he couldn’t because he had been drinking
When I came back from dropping Jaxson off I was relieved to see Robert’s car still outside, she remembered
I knew he’d gone to his room when I got in the house but that was normal when he was particularly down
Sometimes he would go to bed and sleep the day away
I thought he was safe up there and that there was nothing up there that he could hurt himself with
I was heading up the stairs to tell him I’d rang the doctors when the police knocked on the door and said they were doing a welfare check
Then I was told he’d rang his ex-partner and friend to tell them he wanted to kill himself
They finally got his door open and told me to ring an ambulance
I felt completely numb, but I honestly thought he’d be okay
The paramedics and police worked on him for 40 minutes before telling me he’d gone
It didn’t feel real and still doesn’t feel real
How can you believe that someone who had been so full of life could be gone like that? I still think he’s going to walk through the door
How do you accept that your little boy is gone? Since Robert died Rachel says specialist support has also been few and far between and she's had to seek help on Facebook
She says there are lengthy waiting lists just for an initial phone call and charities are becoming overstretched
Robert’s sister Parisse said: There’s a serious lack of help for anyone these days
We need to encourage everyone, especially men, that there is no shame in speaking about your feelings
Too many young men are struggling in silence, we need to support one another

Police officer David Loudon left a family holiday in Wales early and killed himself and son Harrison while his wife and step-children were still away in a tragic set of events A police sergeant who was driven mad by the coronavirus lockdown gassed his three-year-old autistic son to death before killing himself
David Loudon, an officer with West Mercia police, was suffering from depression and anxiety, an inquest heard today
The bodies of the sergeant and his son Harrison were found at their Kidderminster home in August 2021 while the rest of their family were away on holiday
Mr Loudon left a suicide note for his wife saying she'd be better off without him
The court heard how the boy had recently been diagnosed with suspected autism and his behaviour was proving challenging
Covid and the subsequent lockdowns and restrictions had also led to Mr Loudon being unable to get the face-to-face medical attention he felt he and Harrison needed
He left the family holiday in Wales early and killed himself and Harrison while his wife and step-children were still away, Stourport Coroner's Court heard
Mr Loudon had meticulously planned the deaths and also left notes for his family and sent letters to his friends, explaining that he had decided to take his own life and the reasons why
Worcestershire Coroner, David Reid, returned conclusions that Mr Loudon had taken his own life while Harrison Loudon had been unlawfully killed
The inquest had heard how in the various letters and notes he left, he said he was now with Harrison and the angels in heaven, Birmingham Live reports
The tragedy happened at the Loudon's home in Cairndhu Drive, Kidderminster, on August 13 last year
Mr Loudon's wife, Sam, who is also a West Mercia Police officer, told how they had been at a caravan park in Rhyl with her two children and also her in-laws
She told how her husband had made it clear that he didn't want to be there as he was feeling very low in his mood and also felt physically unwell
Harrison was also having frequent meltdowns, the hearing was told
Three days into the holiday, it was decided that Mr Loudon would take Harrison home
In her statement read to the inquest, Mrs Loudon said she had lots of phone calls and text messages with her husband in the following days and everything seemed fine
But on the morning of August 13 she couldn't get hold of her husband on the phone
She also noticed on the camera the family had installed in Harrison's bedroom that he was in bed but hadn't changed position for several hours
I got a knot in my stomach - I knew something was not right, her statement said
I knew Dave was low but I had no idea that suicide was being contemplated, it was never discussed and wasn't a concern
She said a few months previously Mr Loudon had told her I think you and Harrison would be better off without me
She said she thought he meant he was going to leave them and never for a second imagined he was planning suicide
Mrs Loudon rang the police and they forced an entry into the house and found the body of Mr Loudon and Harrison in their respective bedrooms
A post mortem examination for both of them concluded they had died of asphyxiation
The inquest had heard how Mr Loudon went to his GP the year before this happened and said he was feeling low, depressed and anxious, but not suicidal
He was prescribed anti-depressants, but didn't take them, and also had six counselling sessions which were arranged by West Mercia Police
Detective Inspector Mark Walters from West Mercia Police, who carried out an investigation into the double-death, said they were well planned
He said an examination of his phone revealed extensive searches
Several notes and letters were found
One was for his wife, Sam, in which he spoke about his fears for Harrison’s future
I can’t watch Harrison regress and become scared and confused with the world around him
I can’t let that destroy us, the pressure and my diseased mind won out I couldn’t see that this would get anything than worse
He also wrote: The only way is to die, I couldn’t leave you with Harrison, it would be too much
I did it out of love and desperation
In her most recent statement, which was read out to the inquest, Mrs Loudon said: I felt devastated that he didn’t tell me how he was feeling - he had lost hope in everything
I loved him very much but it was an unforgivable decision, I wished he had told me
I will never be able to forgive David for taking the life of our little boy Harrison - he had no right to take my son’s life, regardless of how he was feeling

Kiena Dawes, 23, asked the police for help just weeks before she left her nine-month-old daughter with a close friend and took her own life, with Lancashire Constabulary referring itself to a police watchdog An alleged domestic abuse victim and mum of-one who tragically killed herself on train tracks was let down by the police, her family have claimed today
Kiena Dawes, 23, had left her nine-month-old daughter, Marnie, with a close friend just hours before she was hit by a train and pronounced dead at the scene last Friday
The tragedy happened 11 days after she was allegedly assaulted by a man who her family said she should have been protected from by the police
In a touching tribute, her brother, Kynan, 29, called Kiena an amazing young girl and said that the bubbly mum had just wanted a happy life
But he also revealed shocking new photos showing her looking bloodied and bruised following an alleged assault after police had fitted panic alarms in her home
Speaking today, Kynan blasted Lancashire Constabulary after it emerged the force had referred itself to a police watchdog due to their contact with Kiena before her death
The builder from Blackpool, Lancs, said: The police have let my sister down
They did not do enough
The head of CID is going to go through everything with a toothpick
They're going to find out why nothing happened, and why it got to the point where she felt she wasn't being looked after by the service, which she should be, and decided to take her life
She had panic alarms fitted in her house and a panic alarm fitted around her neck
My sister left a note before she killed herself, on her phone
The facts why she killed herself are stated in that note
In time, that may get shared but not now
He added: The girl was very, very well loved
She never said a bad word about anybody
She just wanted to live a happy little life
Kiena's body was recovered from train tracks near the town of Garstang, Lancs, as friends and family conducted a frantic search for her in nearby streets and alleyways
But before they could locate the missing 23-year-old, they got the terrible news that her body had been found on a rail line just after 1pm, on Friday
Kynan claimed the young woman had sought the help of police roughly five weeks earlier, following allegations that she'd been assaulted on multiple occasions
He said Lancashire Police had fitted her home with a panic alarm and given her a special neckless that had a button she could press if she felt like she was in danger
But Kynan said this hadn't stop her attacker coming to her home on July 11, before he allegedly split her head open, leaving her completely traumatised
And he said the local police should have done more to help her as she attempted to bring her alleged attacker to court
He said: The police have let my sister down, they have
She wanted to go through the legal route to get justice
The girl is dead now, but it should have gone to CPS ages ago
She didn't want to live a life the way she was living, so she ended it
Kynan said his sister had spent her early life growing up in Cyprus before moving to the UK, and later settling in Fleetwood, Lancs
He said she had then trained as a hairdresser and began working at a local shop and had absolutely loved her job
He said: Kiena was the most amazing little girl from when she was first born
She was very bubbly, very nice.  We moved to Cyprus
She used to speak fluent Greek
She had loads of friends in Cyprus
And then we moved back to the UK as my dad had an accident, which did knock her.  She was a hairdresser
She used to work at Rory Blair in Fleetwood
She absolutely loved her job, she was really good at it
She loved having a tan
She would go on the sun beds all the time
All the sun bed shops have been in touch saying, 'We'll miss her, she used to come in
' She was just amazing
A spokesperson for British Transport Police confirmed that Kiena had passed away on a train line and added that they were not treating the death as suspicious

Get email updates with the day's biggest stories Kiena Dawes, 23, asked the police for help just weeks before she left her nine-month-old daughter with a close friend and took her own life, with Lancashire Constabulary referring itself to a police watchdog An alleged domestic abuse victim and mum of-one who tragically killed herself on train tracks was let down by the police, her family have claimed today
Kiena Dawes, 23, had left her nine-month-old daughter, Marnie, with a close friend just hours before she was hit by a train and pronounced dead at the scene last Friday
The tragedy happened 11 days after she was allegedly assaulted by a man who her family said she should have been protected from by the police
In a touching tribute, her brother, Kynan, 29, called Kiena an amazing young girl and said that the bubbly mum had just wanted a happy life
But he also revealed shocking new photos showing her looking bloodied and bruised following an alleged assault after police had fitted panic alarms in her home
Speaking today, Kynan blasted Lancashire Constabulary after it emerged the force had referred itself to a police watchdog due to their contact with Kiena before her death
The builder from Blackpool, Lancs, said: The police have let my sister down
They did not do enough
The head of CID is going to go through everything with a toothpick
They're going to find out why nothing happened, and why it got to the point where she felt she wasn't being looked after by the service, which she should be, and decided to take her life
She had panic alarms fitted in her house and a panic alarm fitted around her neck
My sister left a note before she killed herself, on her phone
The facts why she killed herself are stated in that note
In time, that may get shared but not now
He added: The girl was very, very well loved
She never said a bad word about anybody
She just wanted to live a happy little life

Craig Murray was found dead at Etherow Country Park in Stockport two years ago but his wife Jade believes he should have received better support from mental health services A heartbroken wife has shared her grief after her husband killed himself in the same park where he had proposed to her
Craig Murray had asked his wife Jade to marry him at Etherow Country Park in Stockport, where he was found dead in 2020
The 41-year-old, who had a long history of mental health problems, had only been married for 18 months when he died
Craig had been working as a car salesman at a local dealership prior to his death on May 23, 2020
Two years on Jade, 39, says she is still struggling to come to terms with what happened
She hopes that by sharing her story, mental health services can provide better for those that are struggling
Jade said in quotes reported by the Manchester Evening News : It’s more than two years since I lost Craig and it’s still incredibly difficult to come to terms with the fact he’s no longer here
We had only been married 18 months when he died
Craig’s mental illness was putting a strain on our relationship, but I believe that with the correct treatment Craig would have recovered and we would have spent the rest of our lives together
It devastates me that this won’t happen
Craig had suffered from mental illness since 2013 and in 2019 his health deteriorated again when he developed psychosis and paranoia, as well as delusions and low mood
He was placed under the care of Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust's Access Team and Community Health Team (CMHT), before being referred to the Home Treatment Team in January 2020
He remained under the care of the CMHT and HMT until his death four months later
During this time, he took a number of overdoses
Jade, a bank business manager, said: When his mental health began to deteriorate, he began thinking he was in danger and that people were following him
He moved in with his mum just before lockdown as he kept saying he thought I was also in danger and that our home security was being hacked
It was awful and I kept pleading with him not to do anything stupid
To this day, I still have so many questions over Craig’s death and whether more could have been done to help him
I hope that by sharing my story it will highlight the devastating effects that the lack of appropriate support for loved ones with mental health problems can have
After an inquest in December 2020 highlighted issues in the care provided to Craig, his widow instructed medical negligence experts at Irwin Mitchell to investigate her husband’s care under the Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust
She is joining with her legal team marked World Suicide Prevention Day this month by speaking out on her loss and to help raise awareness around mental illness
What is happening where you live? Find out by adding your postcode
Margaret Ryan, the specialist medical negligence lawyer at Irwin Mitchell representing Jade, said: Craig’s family remain devastated by what’s happened and his son, who was 15 years old at the time, is now without a father
Sadly, the inquest into Craig’s death highlighted issues in the care provided to him in the lead up to his death
We’re now investigating this and will continue to support Jade however we can
Clare Parker, director of nursing, healthcare professionals and quality governance at Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust, said: Our deepest sympathies are with Craig Murray’s family
Our own investigation supported the findings of the coroner
The Covid pandemic meant that we had to rapidly change the way our teams worked and we accepted that a lack of face-to-face contact was a missed opportunity to reassess Mr Murray
We are very sorry this did not happen
World Suicide Prevention Day was on 10 September

David Marsden, 22, was said to 'light up the darkest rooms' by his sister but the young man tragically took his own life after struggling with insomnia which began when a family holiday was cut short A young man who lit up the darkest rooms took his own life after he fell into a mental health spiral during struggles with insomnia
David Marsden first began suffering with the condition when a family holiday in 2019 was cut short
But following that the 22-year-old fell into a vicious cycle of becoming increasingly anxious at his normal life slipping away as his insomnia took over, the Manchester Evening News reports
The lab worker at Stepping Hill hospital suffered episodes of depression and anxiety and spent time on a psychiatric ward in the hospital where he worked
However, on November 21, 2019, months after the family holiday that was cut short, he was found dead in his family home in Stockport
His death triggered PTSD and insomnia in his older sister Charlene Marsden who has since opened up about his death
David's death turned the world of his sister, 33-year-old Charlene Marsden, and she said they had been like twins
She continued: We shared the same interests, the gym, Game of Thrones, all sorts of things
We would literally do everything together, and watch all the shows and movies together
He was literally my best friend
He was loved by so many people
And it's sad because my brother was the person who all his friends, family, and colleagues, including myself, would go to for advice and help when we were feeling low
He knew exactly what to say
His smile would light up the darkest of rooms, but unfortunately, when he found himself in a dark place there was just no way of getting him out of it
I don't think there's a lot of awareness of sibling grief and what it does to you, Charlene added
She said: They are the ones you think will be there when your parents pass
They are your past, your present, and your future so when you lose them at such a young age it's just so tragic and upsetting
I think I'll be dealing with this for the rest of my life
I probably cry most days about him to be fair
There will always be something that will remind you and you'll suddenly be in tears
But it's something I guess you learn to live with as hard as that sounds
You carry it around with you, and after a while, it gets lighter, but it's always there
Charlene struggled so much that she said she suffered from PTSD and her own bout of insomnia
She said: Last year before the inquest it happened to me
I can't even put into words what it was like
But I understood completely what he must have been going through
I had to have three months off work as my mum was terrified it was going to happen to me
I think it was just to do with the grief and the mental issues it had caused
I went three weeks without sleeping.  It was horrendous
Once you get up having not slept all night you become terrified of the evening that's coming next because you think 'am I going to lie there awake all night again
' Your appetite completely goes and you feel sick
You're running on empty, you're like a zombie
I had hypnotherapy, counselling, the lot
But I'm just pushing through as for me it's like I owe it to my brother
Just to show him that I can do it
Obviously it destroyed my brother and I'm not going to let it destroy me
I'm proving it to him, that it doesn't matter how bad things get, you can push through it
Charlene and her and David’s mum, Fiona Marsden, have set up a local support group for those bereaved by suicide
They hold monthly meetings and have now decided they are all going to climb Snowdon to raise funds for four charities close to their hearts
David’s much-loved niece 13-year-old Chantae is also taking part and his cousin Adrian, a former Royal Marine, is acting as a guide and support during the climb
Charlene said: We just want to spread awareness and raise as much as we can for these charities and I think that funding is vital at the minute as demand has gone up massively and there just isn't enough funding there
The climb will be a challenge but also really symbolic as I'm still climbing a mountain with my grief
But I truly believe it's helping
That's why it means so much to all of us
Charlene intends to sprinkle some of her brother's ashes at the summit
I know the views will be beautiful and he loved nature, she said
I am in awe of all the members
I'm in my thirties but several of them are older and have health issues
But we'll just take it at the pace of the slowest climber and if we reach the top we've done our bit for those who need our help the most
With mental health being paramount I go through life now with the motto 'in a world where you can be anything, be kind
' One small act of kindness could save a life and that's what will be driving us on the day

But I truly believe it's helping
That's why it means so much to all of us
Charlene intends to sprinkle some of her brother's ashes at the summit
I know the views will be beautiful and he loved nature, she said
I am in awe of all the members
I'm in my thirties but several of them are older and have health issues
But we'll just take it at the pace of the slowest climber and if we reach the top we've done our bit for those who need our help the most
With mental health being paramount I go through life now with the motto 'in a world where you can be anything, be kind
' One small act of kindness could save a life and that's what will be driving us on the day

David Marsden, 22, was said to 'light up the darkest rooms' by his sister but the young man tragically took his own life after struggling with insomnia which began when a family holiday was cut short A young man who lit up the darkest rooms took his own life after he fell into a mental health spiral during struggles with insomnia
David Marsden first began suffering with the condition when a family holiday in 2019 was cut short
But following that the 22-year-old fell into a vicious cycle of becoming increasingly anxious at his normal life slipping away as his insomnia took over, the Manchester Evening News reports
The lab worker at Stepping Hill hospital suffered episodes of depression and anxiety and spent time on a psychiatric ward in the hospital where he worked
However, on November 21, 2019, months after the family holiday that was cut short, he was found dead in his family home in Stockport
His death triggered PTSD and insomnia in his older sister Charlene Marsden who has since opened up about his death
David's death turned the world of his sister, 33-year-old Charlene Marsden, and she said they had been like twins
She continued: We shared the same interests, the gym, Game of Thrones, all sorts of things
We would literally do everything together, and watch all the shows and movies together
He was literally my best friend
He was loved by so many people
And it's sad because my brother was the person who all his friends, family, and colleagues, including myself, would go to for advice and help when we were feeling low
He knew exactly what to say
His smile would light up the darkest of rooms, but unfortunately, when he found himself in a dark place there was just no way of getting him out of it
I don't think there's a lot of awareness of sibling grief and what it does to you, Charlene added
She said: They are the ones you think will be there when your parents pass
They are your past, your present, and your future so when you lose them at such a young age it's just so tragic and upsetting
I think I'll be dealing with this for the rest of my life
I probably cry most days about him to be fair
There will always be something that will remind you and you'll suddenly be in tears
But it's something I guess you learn to live with as hard as that sounds
You carry it around with you, and after a while, it gets lighter, but it's always there
Charlene struggled so much that she said she suffered from PTSD and her own bout of insomnia
She said: Last year before the inquest it happened to me
I can't even put into words what it was like
But I understood completely what he must have been going through
I had to have three months off work as my mum was terrified it was going to happen to me
I think it was just to do with the grief and the mental issues it had caused
I went three weeks without sleeping.  It was horrendous
Once you get up having not slept all night you become terrified of the evening that's coming next because you think 'am I going to lie there awake all night again
' Your appetite completely goes and you feel sick
You're running on empty, you're like a zombie
I had hypnotherapy, counselling, the lot
But I'm just pushing through as for me it's like I owe it to my brother
Just to show him that I can do it
Obviously it destroyed my brother and I'm not going to let it destroy me
I'm proving it to him, that it doesn't matter how bad things get, you can push through it
Charlene and her and David’s mum, Fiona Marsden, have set up a local support group for those bereaved by suicide
They hold monthly meetings and have now decided they are all going to climb Snowdon to raise funds for four charities close to their hearts
David’s much-loved niece 13-year-old Chantae is also taking part and his cousin Adrian, a former Royal Marine, is acting as a guide and support during the climb

Gina Fitzgerald died from issues with her heart, but the circumstances she was found in at her home in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, have left her heartbroken family traumatised A seven-year-old boy with autism awoke to find his beloved grandma dead after the pair huddled together for warmth in their freezing cold home
Gina Fitzgerald's death was caused by heart problems and the cold conditions were not a factor in her passing
But the circumstances she was found in have traumatised her grieving family, Coventry Live reports
The boy, who turns eight this week, found his nan had passed away after waking up next to her at their home in Camp HIll, Nuneaton, Warwickshire, last week
The night before Gina had huddled close to her grandson to keep away the cold after being left without suitable heating at their house
Gina's family say they had been left without a working boiler for months
But Bromford Housing claims temporary heating had been provided while they were trying to arrange a fix for the broken boiler
Speaking to Coventry Live, a family friend said all they received were three small heaters which the Fitzgeralds said they could not afford to run all night
They also feared for their safety if the electrical devices were left on from bedtime until the morning
The friend, who didn't want to be named, told CoventryLive that while the cold conditions did not contribute to the death of the much-loved community member, who died from a heart condition, they said the situation they have been forced to live in has added to the family's trauma, especially that of the boy
In fact, the heartache has been made worse for the little boy, who has autism, turned eight this week - without his beloved grandma being there
Whilst there is no evidence to prove the cold is the reason for sad passing it clearly would not have helped her when she was suffering with a heart condition, the family friend said
On the morning of December 2, her grandson woke next to her, and was unable to wake her
Having autism, this must have been the most traumatic experience
When friends came in to help the family during the shock we were told the house was freezing we were shivering
Gina was found wrapped in blankets just trying to keep warm, when the ambulance crew arrived they tried to revive her but she had gone
The family are left in utter grief and dismay, Gina was the main support for this vulnerable family
Friends and the Camp Hill community have rallied around the family at their time of huge loss and have launched a fund-raising appeal in her name
Camp Hill-based charity, The Guardians Grow Charity, are spearheading the funeral and send off they say she deserves
Money raised will also be donated to the family, who the charity says will struggle without their matriarch
So far, the fund has raised just over £500 in a matter of days, but they hope to double it to help the family as much as they can
Bromford has said that the family reported issues with the boiler last month and they had planned to carry out the works last week
A spokesperson offered their condolences to the family, and said they will work with them to fix the heating, having provided temporary heating in the meantime
In a statement, Natalie Robertson, Bromford’s associate director of localities, said: We were deeply saddened to hear of Mrs Fitzgerald’s death and have offered her family our condolences at this difficult time
We carried out our annual safety inspection of the heating and hot water system at Mrs Fitzgerald’s property in June and found it to be in good working order
Mrs Fitzgerald contacted us in mid-November about a fault to her emersion heater affecting her heating and hot water, and we attended two days later to investigate and ordered the parts needed to complete the repair
We had scheduled for the repairs to be completed in early December and are now liaising with the family to rearrange this and have provided temporary heating in the meantime

Chloe Barber, of Driffield, East Yorkshire, was bullied at school, self-harmed and eventually took her own life at home in November last year
Her mum has shared her grief A devastated mother has shared her grief after her teenage daughter was found hanged at the family home
Kirsten Barber said Chloe Barber, 18, fell through the cracks of the mental health system after several stays in psychiatric hospitals
Her brother Reece Barber, 15, discovered Chloe unresponsive and, though her called 999 and gave Chloe CPR, the teenager was pronounced dead at the home in Driffield, East Yorkshire
Speaking today, grief-stricken Kirsten said Chloe struggled after being diagnosed with unstable personality disorder
She told Hull Live : You know when people say they’re heartbroken? This is heartbroken
When you split up with your boyfriend and stuff like that you think you know heartbreak.  But this is heartbreak
Anyone who is able to can donate to Kirsten's JustGiving page for their Three Peaks challenge for Chloe here
There are times when I just want to tell Chloe something, like when our dogs have done something daft and then you remember you can’t
But I know she’s still here
I had Covid last month and the worst thing about it was losing my sense of smell
I went into her bedroom because I just go in there every so often to be near her, and I couldn’t smell her
The family had first noticed signs Chloe was struggling in 2017 when she was a victim of bullying at school
She also self-harmed as her condition deteriorated over the following years
On one occasion, Chloe didn't return to Mill Lodge Hospital in York after going for a walk
And in early 2021, the teenager was hospitalised at Cygnet Health Care where her problems with self harm became worse
It was at Cygnet where she also met friend Chelsea Blue Mooney, a teenager from Bridlington, North Yorkshire, who shortly later died while in the unit's care
Chloe was left devastated by 17-year-old Chelsea’s death in April last year
Kirsten continued: Mental health is an invisible killer
If someone’s got cancer or a broken leg you can physically see it and you can physically mend it
We still don’t know exactly what Chloe was going through
She was a very secretive person
Chloe took her own life in November last year
Kirsten is taking on the Yorkshire Three Peaks later this spring to raise cash for young suicide charity Papyrus
Figures released by the Office of National Statistics (ONS) this week show 587 people in Yorkshire & the Humber took their lives in 2021 - of which 419 were men or boys and 168 women or girls
Data suggests suicide figures did not rise during the pandemic, although have slowly risen over the past 10 years
And while suicide remains the biggest killer of young men, the number of female suicides has been insidiously creeping up in recent years
Papyrus supports young people affected by suicide and suicidal thoughts, and has seen a 25% increase in calls, texts and emails to its confidential HOPELINEUK service
In 2020 and 2021 at least one in every three contacts was from a child under the age of 18
Anyone who is able to can donate to Kirsten's JustGiving page for their Three Peaks challenge for Chloe here
A spokesperson from Humber Teaching NHS Foundation Trust, said: It is the position of the Trust that we do not comment on individual cases, as we prefer to discuss directly with the families who are affected

Carrie Kearns, 40, from Bolton, was told by doctors that the reason why she felt so exhausted was because she had been masking all day and trying to fit in A woman discovered she had a life-changing condition after always feeling tired after getting home from work
Carrie Kearns, 40, only recently learned she had autism after struggling to fit in throughout her life and considering herself a loner
Doctors explained the reason why she felt so exhausted was because she had been masking all day trying to fit in
The mum-of-two, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, said she felt relieved by the discovery after the difficulties she has faced
It is a relief finding out you’re autistic because you realise there’s nothing wrong with me, she told Manchester Evening News
I understand the way I think and the way I act and I do things is normal for me and it’s okay to do those things and be that way
Autism is a lifelong developmental disability that typically appears during early childhood and can impact a person's social skills, communication and relationships
People with autism can struggle with some areas of communication and social interaction
They might also find it difficult to relate to people and understand their emotions, and have inflexible thought patterns and repetitive actions
Carrie was diagnosed with the condition around six months after speaking with her GP
She said: I read into autism and it was the only thing that fit and made a lot of sense
You can’t tell if someone is autistic but you can tell there’s something different about someone
My therapist said I was high-functioning because I have a husband and children

Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here
But when people say you’re high-functioning, the reason the labels are so misleading are because it takes something away from the individual but doesn’t speak for their troubles
I thought I was grumpy and snappy as a kid but those moments were meltdowns when everything got a bit too much and I was overwhelmed and over stimulated
That’s why I found social interactions so exhausting
Carrie started to read up on autism after her young son was diagnosed and she noticed similar traits within herself, especially from when she was growing up
Ever since I was a child, I noticed I was different, she said

I didn’t seem to be able to fit in with other children my age and I was always a bit of a loner playing out on my own
I was more interested in nature and playing with plants and bugs than the games my friends were playing
I was bullied a lot because I came across as weird
I never seemed to get them, the games they played or the way they spoke
There were a lot of misunderstandings because I would take things too deeply and miss the point
The way I would dress wasn’t in line with the fashion at the time and I wasn’t dressing the same as other people
As I got older, I found work was difficult because I would get in trouble for speaking my mind
I was quite passionate and it would come out as me being aggressive
I was so tired when I got back home from work
When I got diagnosed, I was told it was because I had been masking all day trying to fit in
The mum said she felt lucky for the speed of her diagnosis
She said: I was really lucky with the diagnosis because it didn’t take that long
I was only waiting around six months which is absolutely amazing

Tracey Ham claimed half of her son Zachary's 13th birthday at Thorpe Park was wasted on the bumper cars before staff finally gave them a fast track pass so they could skip the queues A mum says her autistic son's birthday was ruined after he was refused an access pass to Thorpe Park - and claims it's because he's not disabled enough
Tracy Ham, 41, receives the Disability Living Allowance as her 13-year-old son Zachary Relfe is autistic, MyLondon reported
On previous visits to the theme park the pair were given a Ride Access Pass by just showing proof of disability to staff as Zachary finds it hard to queue
However, mum Tracey claims a new policy means her son is considered not disabled enough to receive the pass
She arrived at the park on Saturday May 28 at 10
15am and was told by officials she needed to fill in a form online with seven days notice
The mum from Paddock Wood said she did not know about the change but Thorpe Park claim the Ride Access Pass was made available online to Tracey before her visit date
She filled out their application but as Zachary only gets middle-rate care - not the high-rate required - he was not eligible
However, the Ride Access Passes is guided by external regulatory bodies who determine whether someone is classed as lower rate, middle rate or higher rate, as this classification is not set by Thorpe Park and they have no input
The mum and son then spent the next four hours walking around the park with Zachary unable to manage long queues
He decided to ride the bumper cars five times instead
Tracy said: I was raging
I was just really angry that my money and time had been wasted, and disappointed his birthday had been ruined
He looks forward to his trip to Thorpe Park every year
Tracy added: The person who gets the rage off the child is the mother, he could not go on the things he wanted to go on
It was just a waste of time
If I had known I would not have gone there
She returned to customer services again and battled the dodgy WiFi to fill out the form again with Tracey estimating she spent an hour of the day just filling in forms
After it was rejected again, a member of staff decided to issue her with fast track tickets as a gesture of goodwill, allowing her to skip queues as she had hoped to in the morning
Despite being eventually issued the instant access tickets, Tracy said it was still a shame the day was wasted
She added: Because of the way my son is we do not go out that often, which made it harder again
There's a lot of people who go with disabled children so I imagine it's affected a lot of people

A spokesperson for Thorpe Park told the Mirror: As part of our ongoing focus on providing the best possible experience for our guests when visiting our UK theme parks, we have listened to guest feedback and have moved to an advanced registration for our Ride Access Pass
Documentation is requested to ensure the Ride Access Pass remains effective for guests who need it, and by doing this in advance the process is more efficient for all
There have not been any changes to the criteria or the documentation for Ride Access Passes that we accept this season
The only change is the simplification of the process by centralising it and moving it online, rather than at the attraction, so guests can simply apply online ahead of their visit
We are committed to listening, learning and adapting to the needs of our guests, and welcome the opportunity to discuss guest experiences to help us create the best experiences possible for the future
Get email updates with the day's biggest stories Tracey Ham claimed half of her son Zachary's 13th birthday at Thorpe Park was wasted on the bumper cars before staff finally gave them a fast track pass so they could skip the queues A mum says her autistic son's birthday was ruined after he was refused an access pass to Thorpe Park - and claims it's because he's not disabled enough
Tracy Ham, 41, receives the Disability Living Allowance as her 13-year-old son Zachary Relfe is autistic, MyLondon reported
On previous visits to the theme park the pair were given a Ride Access Pass by just showing proof of disability to staff as Zachary finds it hard to queue
However, mum Tracey claims a new policy means her son is considered not disabled enough to receive the pass
She arrived at the park on Saturday May 28 at 10
15am and was told by officials she needed to fill in a form online with seven days notice
The mum from Paddock Wood said she did not know about the change but Thorpe Park claim the Ride Access Pass was made available online to Tracey before her visit date
She filled out their application but as Zachary only gets middle-rate care - not the high-rate required - he was not eligible

Lorna Hewitt, 43, and Craig, 42, were each sentenced to six years behind bars after they were found guilty of falsely imprisoning Matthew Langley, 22, at their home in Sheffield, South Yorkshire A mum and stepdad who locked their autistic son in an attic where he was found close to death have been jailed today Lorna Hewitt, 43, and her husband Craig, 42, were each sentenced to six years behind bars after they were found guilty of falsely imprisoning Matthew Langley, 22, at their home in Sheffield, South Yorkshire
Matthew was severely dehydrated and weighed just six stone - or 36 kilos - when he was found inside the vomit and faeces-covered room
Judge Michael Slater, described Lorna Hewitt's actions as a grave abuse of trust between a mother and her son sentencing at Sheffield Crown Court on Friday
He added: You were the primary carer for Matthew with all his difficulties and challenges
It makes it all the more inexplicable to me that for those seven months you failed to provide him with the support and provision of food and drink that he craved and needed
The Hewitts had earlier denied keeping Matthew captive at their home for seven months, but a jury found them both guilty
The couple were also found guilty of causing or allowing a vulnerable adult to suffer serious physical harm
Matthew was found by paramedics seriously underweight, dehydrated and with his life hanging in the balance, the court heard
Nicholas Campbell QC, prosecuting, previously said the ambulance service was called to the home in Sheffield, South Yorks, in the early hours of June 2, 2020
Matthew was rushed to a hospital intensive care unit in a pitiable state with abrasions indicating he had been moving around on all fours, the prosecutor told the court
He had suffered damage to a kidney with high sodium levels relating to severe dehydration, it was heard
Mr Campbell added: His sodium levels were dangerously high.  They measured 180
They were so high they could shut down his brain and kill him
Anything above 145, there is a real chance of death
The Home Office pathologist examined the injuries and said the abrasions and bruises were consistent in his view with Matthew having been crawling on all fours over objects in his path
When police went into the attic they found faeces and vomit all over the floor and the bedding, and it was swarming with buzzing flies, the court heard
Police also found a key on the outside of the door, it was said
Matthew, who has suffered from irritable bowel syndrome, incontinence, arthritis and learning difficulties, had weighed only six stone when he was found, Mr Campbell said
In November 2019, just seven months prior, he had weighed eight-and-a-half stone, the court heard
Seven months earlier, in November 2019, he had weighed eight-and-a-half stone, the court heard
Thanks to the hard of medical professionals, Matthew made a good physical recovery and was discharged from the hospital weights 8. 6 stone
In mitigation, John Harrison, for Lorna Hewitt, read a report from psychologist Rekha Davis that said she was vulnerable to manipulation and exploitation and was easily suggestible
The report stated, he said: Given her emotional vulnerability, Mrs Hewitt's capacity to consider the consequences of her actions and decisions is limited
Miss Tana Adkin QC, representing Mr Craig Hewitt, said there had been a significant change in his understanding of what he had done throughout the court proceedings
She said: He is devastated about what happened to Mathew
He is not a deliberately cruel man in the sense that the courts see and have seen in the past
He is not someone that would punish Matthew for his autism

However, Judge Slater disagreed with these characterisations as he sentenced the pair behind bars
Addressing Craig Hewitt, the judge said: You were complicit equally with wife Lorna Hewitt in care effectively-being switched off to any degree for Matthew as he was locked in his room and starved of food
That did not occur by negligence, it did not occur by recklessness
It was a plan between the pair of you
I'm quite satisfied that nothing in that household occurred without either you knowing about it or approving of it
Speaking directly to Lorna Hewitt, he said: It is argued on your behalf that you were particularly vulnerable and suggestible at the time
I had the benefit of observing you give evidence in the trial over the course of several days
It did not seem to me that you were not capable of standing up for yourself or that you were particularly suggestible
You were both an articulate, temperate and thoughtful witness

Ms Nevill and the family had not realised until they were back home in Norfolk that they had left their nine-year-old daughter Summer's teddy behind A mum is furious after a company asked her to fork out £20 for shipping - to return her autistic daughter's teddy bear
Donna Nevill, 34, went away on a family holiday to Slough to take in the sights of nearby London, using Onpoint Apartments
But the family were unhappy with the state of their accommodation so left a day early, on Friday July 1
Ms Nevill and the family had not realised until they were back home that they had left their daughter Summer's teddy behind
Summer, aged nine, is autistic and heavily reliant on the comforter, which she struggles to sleep without
However, when the family contacted the company to let them know what happened, they say that they were told they had to pay a one-off charge of £20 for it to be sent back
Onpoint Apartments has told NottinghamshireLive they make no profit from the £20 fee and as a small business they cannot absorb such a cost
Ms Nevill, from Norfolk, said: We put Summer to bed and realised we didn't have her comforter with her - she sleeps with it every night
I messaged the apartments who said they were sending the cleaners in
The cleaners found it and I was told that if I paid postage they would send it back
I told them that they should really send it back for free as a gesture of goodwill as the apartment was shocking - we complained straight away and nothing was done about it
It took me over a week of phoning them everyday asking 'what are you going to do about it?' I had an autistic, distressed child who was crying all the time because of it
They eventually sent me the invoice and it was £20
It's just a teddy bear - it does not cost that much to send it back
I am prepared to pay a fiver, maybe a tenner, but not £20
We are going abroad next week and so we need it back as my daughter needs it for the airplane
The attitude has just been 'we don't care, you're not getting it back unless you pay'.  It is absolutely shocking
She added that she would struggle to even afford to pay £20 for the return, as the family contends with the ongoing cost of living crisis
Donna and Summer had been on holiday with Summer's dad Richard Nevill, 35, along with her sister Lilly, aged six, and four-year-old brother Aarlo
In an email seen by Nottinghamshire Live, the company tells the family that it takes no responsibility for personal belongings left behind and that the returning of such items does come at a cost
They also stated that they must pay the cleaners to go to the post office to return it via post
In a statement, the company said: We are aware of this matter and would like to emphasise that we appreciate the situation and the importance of the item
We detail in our terms of conditions of stay that any items left behind after check out is solely down to the responsibility of the guest
With this particular matter, the guest contacted us to advise that she left behind her child’s teddy and needed this item back
We worked with the guest, located the teddy and offered a collection of the item, this was rejected due to the guest living too far away from the property
What is happening where you live? Find out by adding your postcode
We then offered to send the item at a total cost of £20, payable by the guest
We would like to stress that we are by no means taking any profit from this scenario
As a small business, we employ individuals that charge a call out fee; this includes packaging the item, labelling the item, travelling to and from the post office and the cost to post the item (first class, recorded delivery for tracking purposes)
Being a small business, this is not something we can absorb
We have offered solutions for this guest to ensure they receive the item, however, neither option has been accepted
We evidently would prefer this matter to be resolved and to have the item back with the owner
We hope with the above explanation, it can be appreciated why a fee of £20 has been requested as there are more costs involved than just simply posting an item
The item was left behind by the guest and this is their responsibility
As the item has a significant importance for her daughter, along with the understanding that this is the guests' error and the factors involved that determine the £20 cost, we would have hoped for a solution from the guest instead of the need to approach a newspaper
We are still awaiting the guest to accept the postage fee so as we can ship this back out to her first class, recorded delivery

Emma Armstrong's daughter Libby Crossfield will only eat Aldi's Weetabix and its organic Mamia baby food, and either spaghetti bolognese or spaghetti with tomato and mozzarella sauce A mum has been forced to beg with Aldi for help in a desperate battle to get her hands on the only food her autistic daughter will eat
Emma Armstrong's daughter Libby Crossfield will only eat Aldi's own brand of Weetabix and its organic Mamia baby food, and either spaghetti bolognese or spaghetti with tomato and mozzarella sauce, Manchester Evening News reports
Mum-of-three Emma has always kept well stocked up on the products as she knows that Libby, who has profound social and communication difficulties and suffers from sensory issues, will refuse to eat anything else
But with supermarkets struggling with certain supplies, she's down to her last few tubs and only has enough to last until lunchtime on Saturday, which is Libby's fourth birthday
The panicked mother, from Failsworth, Oldham, has been driving around Aldi stores across Greater Manchester to check for stock and leave her number with managers and she's been in touch with the manufacturer to establish when the retailer was due its next delivery
It might seem like a small issue to some people but we're just hitting a brick wall, she told Manchester Evening News
Aldi are not helping at all other than a standard response
I know they have the stock, the manufacturer told me it arrived from France at the weekend
I just need them to get some to me
Family and friends have been on the hunt too, including Emma's sister Adele, whose tweet has been shared more than 200 times - with strangers as far as Aberdeen and Northern Ireland checking their own stores for stock
And it's a lot more serious than Libby just not having the food she likes on her birthday
Emma says eating wheat cereal alone will leave the youngster poorly and malnourished and if she has a period without the baby food, she may struggle to reintroduce it to Libby's diet
Emma, who works in a restaurant and also has five-year-old twin boys Frankie and Finley, said: She used to eat more of a variety of baby food but this has decreased to these particular foods
My concern is that if this food is taken away from her diet for a time I won’t be able to reintroduce it, this will lead to malnutrition and eventually we could end up with tube feeding or peg feeding
She added that it's become like a full-time job trying to track down the food and everything else, including trying to sort a specialist school place for Libby has had to be put on the back burner
An Aldi spokesperson said: We are sorry to hear that Emma hasn’t been able to find our Mamia dishes in store
We are working hard with our supplier to deliver Libby’s favourite Mamia dishes to her directly in time for her big birthday

Mum Candice Hudspith had just entered the Mcdonald's near Gateshead when four-year-old Harper started screaming and crying but thankfully a kind member of staff stepped in to help A mum has shared a heartwarming message of thanks after a touching display of kindness from a McDonald's staff member which meant the world to her autistic daughter
Candice Hudspith, 33, from Gateshead, visited the McDonald's on the Felling Bypass near Newcastle last weekend with her two daughters, Harper, four, and Indy, two
As they entered the restaurant Harper, who was diagnosed with autism just before her fourth birthday, suddenly became triggered, beginning to scream and shout
Often, Candice said, she would leave a situation if Harper started to struggle
But thanks to the kindness of one of the restaurant's staff members, the busy mum was able to stay and enjoy a relaxing coffee, while Harper was able to calm down and enjoy a meal
Candice said: I don't know what had triggered Harper, when I got out of the car I knew she was hungry, but there was just something triggering her and the difficult thing is you can't ask what it is
Walking in she was screaming, saying 'no no no'
Everyone is looking at me like I am the mother with the screaming child
As I was walking in Rachel, one of the workers, said 'oh wow I think I have a flag would you like one?' And she looked at me and said 'you're doing an amazing job'
Harper ran off and hid under a seat, so the considerate worker got down on the floor with paper and crayons, inviting the little girl to colour in with her
Candice said: You could see Harper slowly coming out of herself
She was back in her little world, being happy Harper again
I literally burst into tears
I felt like I didn't even have to say that she has autism, it was like she read my mind
It was so lovely what she was doing
I don't think Rachel realised how good her customer service was
It may sound like nothing to others but it meant the world to me.  Absolutely outstanding service
When Candice shared her thanks to Rachel on Facebook, her post received over 3,000 likes as people praised the McDonald's worker
The mum said she was touched by the response and shared her story in an effort to thank Rachel
She added she wanted to show difference small acts of kindness can make to struggling parents
Candice said she was also keen to encourage more people to be understanding of autism, the diagnosis that has helped her ensure her daughter gets the help she needs

She said: At the moment I'm doing a course on autism just so I can be more understanding, but when she was younger - and I think quite a lot of mums could relate to this - I was, not quite in denial, but I felt as if I didn't want to label my child
But once you get the help and you have the diagnosis you realise it's not labelling your child, it's getting them the help that they need
All the doors open up and you are able to get the best for your child
If I had still been in denial I don't know where Harper would be now, but with me being the mum I am and having the support around me she's come on so much
If you do see a situation like that in public, you really shouldn't judge
I think our generation is starting to understand a lot more about autism, back in the day it would be just seen as 'naughty children' but I think there is more understanding now

All the doors open up and you are able to get the best for your child
If I had still been in denial I don't know where Harper would be now, but with me being the mum I am and having the support around me she's come on so much
If you do see a situation like that in public, you really shouldn't judge
I think our generation is starting to understand a lot more about autism, back in the day it would be just seen as 'naughty children' but I think there is more understanding now

Gina Fitzgerald died from issues with her heart, but the circumstances she was found in at her home in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, have left her heartbroken family traumatised A seven-year-old boy with autism awoke to find his beloved grandma dead after the pair huddled together for warmth in their freezing cold home
Gina Fitzgerald's death was caused by heart problems and the cold conditions were not a factor in her passing
But the circumstances she was found in have traumatised her grieving family, Coventry Live reports
The boy, who turns eight this week, found his nan had passed away after waking up next to her at their home in Camp HIll, Nuneaton, Warwickshire, last week
The night before Gina had huddled close to her grandson to keep away the cold after being left without suitable heating at their house
Gina's family say they had been left without a working boiler for months
But Bromford Housing claims temporary heating had been provided while they were trying to arrange a fix for the broken boiler
Speaking to Coventry Live, a family friend said all they received were three small heaters which the Fitzgeralds said they could not afford to run all night
They also feared for their safety if the electrical devices were left on from bedtime until the morning
The friend, who didn't want to be named, told CoventryLive that while the cold conditions did not contribute to the death of the much-loved community member, who died from a heart condition, they said the situation they have been forced to live in has added to the family's trauma, especially that of the boy
In fact, the heartache has been made worse for the little boy, who has autism, turned eight this week - without his beloved grandma being there
Whilst there is no evidence to prove the cold is the reason for sad passing it clearly would not have helped her when she was suffering with a heart condition, the family friend said
On the morning of December 2, her grandson woke next to her, and was unable to wake her
Having autism, this must have been the most traumatic experience
When friends came in to help the family during the shock we were told the house was freezing we were shivering
Gina was found wrapped in blankets just trying to keep warm, when the ambulance crew arrived they tried to revive her but she had gone
The family are left in utter grief and dismay, Gina was the main support for this vulnerable family
Friends and the Camp Hill community have rallied around the family at their time of huge loss and have launched a fund-raising appeal in her name
Camp Hill-based charity, The Guardians Grow Charity, are spearheading the funeral and send off they say she deserves
Money raised will also be donated to the family, who the charity says will struggle without their matriarch
So far, the fund has raised just over £500 in a matter of days, but they hope to double it to help the family as much as they can
Bromford has said that the family reported issues with the boiler last month and they had planned to carry out the works last week
A spokesperson offered their condolences to the family, and said they will work with them to fix the heating, having provided temporary heating in the meantime
In a statement, Natalie Robertson, Bromford’s associate director of localities, said: We were deeply saddened to hear of Mrs Fitzgerald’s death and have offered her family our condolences at this difficult time
We carried out our annual safety inspection of the heating and hot water system at Mrs Fitzgerald’s property in June and found it to be in good working order
Mrs Fitzgerald contacted us in mid-November about a fault to her emersion heater affecting her heating and hot water, and we attended two days later to investigate and ordered the parts needed to complete the repair
We had scheduled for the repairs to be completed in early December and are now liaising with the family to rearrange this and have provided temporary heating in the meantime

Lucy Beaumont tells how her mum was diagnosed with several neurodivergent conditions during lockdown, but the time allowed her to figure out why she had found certain things so challenging With all the talk of Partygate and the Sue Gray report this week, it feels a bit like time to reflect on the past two years and how Covid, lockdown and the return to a new normal have affected each of us differently
There’s no question what went on in No10 in that hardest of times was wrong
But as I look back at the pandemic, for the first time now I’m able to see what me and my family have gained from it
During lockdown my mum, at the age of 65, was diagnosed with high-functioning female Aspergers, ADHD and alexithymia
You might never have heard of the last condition, which affects how you express and process emotion, but one in 10 people are reported to have it
The diagnosis only came about because the world slowed down
Lockdown allowed me and my mum to reflect on how she struggles in certain situations – and excels in others
More and more women in particular are being diagnosed with neurodiversities later in life, with celebrities such as Christine McGuinness and Melanie Sykes talking openly about it in recent months
And sometimes just having a diagnosis is enough to start making sense of yourself
For Mum, the feelings of guilt, of not fitting in, being sometimes seen as rude or badly behaved, means life has been a roller coaster
These feelings have been replaced with a sense of living beyond survival mode
I instantly took to the internet to find guidance and support for myself, being an adult child of an autistic parent
My mum is extremely caring and protective over me, if anything she’s overly empathetic
It must have been hard for her as a single parent
We have gone through a lot, the past is in the past, but the diagnosis triggered a lot of emotional feelings for me
I feel I had more advantages than disadvantages as the child of a mum with Asperger’s but kids can feel overlooked or have to act like the parent

There may be no filter comments and a parent might need vices as a crutch to ease their pain
Our story is unique to us and is not a comment on others and their abilities to be neurodiverse and a parent
But it would be great to see radical change in this area and support for children, alongside a reduction in NHS waiting times for diagnosis
If only someone could have sat down my eight-year-old self to explain to me why my mum found life so difficult and that it wasn’t my fault
Gosh, I hope the support improves

Pictures of Steffan Rees are not what people expect to see after he took his own life
They show pure joy and happiness as he teaches his baby niece a joyful song The final images of a man before his life ended are what his family want everyone to see
Pictures of Steffan Rees are not what people expect to see after he took his own life
They show pure joy and happiness as he teaches his baby niece If You Are Happy And You Know It
Stefan's sister Sian, from Cardigan, Wales, says her brother was the life and soul of the party and the kind of person who lit up the room when he arrived
Wales On line reports it is why his suicide was such a shock and drives his devastated sister to help others
She said: I couldn't have asked for a better brother
He was only 26, had a loving family, a beautiful girlfriend, and didn't say anything about having any mental health issues
Since his death Sian has tried to find positives
Together with widows Lisa and Ana, who have also been bereaved through suicide, they have set up a support group and taken part in a UK awareness campaign
New research from suicide prevention charity Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) has found that 61% of people would struggle to tell if someone they knew felt suicidal
The charity wants to raise awareness that the ‘face of suicide’ isn’t always crying and being recluse
A person might seem happy on the outside, and to illustrate this, the charity has unveiled an exhibition on London’s Southbank called 'The Last Photo'
The outdoor gallery displays 50 smiling photos taken in the last days of people who died by suicide
It also shares the stories of shock and grief their families and friends experienced
A photograph of Steffan forms part of the moving exhibition, as do the pictures of Peter Hammett, from Swansea, and Lee, from Tenby
Along with Sian, Peter's wife Lisa and Lee's wife Ana have set up a support group - LISS - Living in Suicide Shadow because they felt there was a lack of support for those bereaved by suicide
Ana said: We are a peer-to-peer support group that aims to break the 'isolation' that we often find ourselves in by organising face to face and virtual meet ups, walks, family activities with people that understand the pain of suicide
The latest figures show that 125 people die by suicide every week in the UK, but it can be hard to spot the signs something isn’t okay Just months after Ana's husband died of suicide another CALM's project called 84, which represented the number of people who died every week in the UK in 2018, was launched
Ana, whose children were nine and six when her husband died, said: The 84 project floored me
It had such a powerful message; I couldn't believe 84 men took their lives every week… so many families, friends, and communities heartbroken
Suddenly, my husband's individual act was not so individual anymore
If the suicide average was constant, how can we blame such rates of suicide on one individual's reckless decision? It felt much more like a social issue, and if it was the case, then we could do something about it
Talking about this campaign she said: I will never forget those beautiful smiles of those beautiful people… beautiful children, beautiful women, handsome men, different ages, different genders, different social classes, different ethnicities, proof that suicide can happen to anyone
The shadows of the leaves moving with the wind and the sun created movement in the photos
I kept looking and hoping that they would start moving
And even though it was so comforting to see a life-size picture, I found it so hard to leave the exhibition; I wanted to bring him home with me, we miss Lee so much! The picture of Lee, who was 41 when he died, was taken in Castell Henllys, Pembrokeshire, on a wonderful day out with friends
There were Roman attacks, and Celtic victories, plenty of laughter and at one point Lee had all the kids shoeless crossing the stream in the cold April
Never in a million years would any of us believe that he would be gone less than a couple of months later
Our children were only six and nine when he died
He loved them to bits and was always with them
They would say 'but daddy was always happy with he was with me'
It was not long after Lee's death that Ana met Lisa, through Dr Dai Lloyd, an MS who has been heavily involved in suicide prevention campaigns
Ana added: Things have moved on a lot in recent years, but there is a lot of stigma around suicide
People would say things like he is your husband, you live with him, how did you not see it, some people blame you for it, others don't know what to say
It is said that we lose around 70% of our circle of family and friends as it is difficult for people to understand and support our grief
Being able to talk with other people who have been through the same experience has helped
The group has helped the three form a close bond
We have been on a journey together the last couple of years and it seemed fitting that we should all be taking part in The Last Photo campaign and supporting each other, she said
The exhibition was held on the Southbank somewhere I'd previously visited with my family including Peter with such happy memories
My immediate reaction when I saw the life size photo of Peter was to cry
I placed my hand upon his face in disbelief remembering this photo I had taken on our 33rd wedding anniversary just three months before he died
She added: When Peter died I was determined to make a stand against the stigma associated with suicide and for his death not to be in vein I'm so proud we all took part in CALMs The Last Photo campaign
We hope all our stories make a difference and ultimately save lives

Lindsey Bridges says daughter Lauren was failed by the mental health system, saying it 'robbed her of her daughter, her son of a sister and her parents of their granddaughter' A broken mum has paid tribute to her beautiful and brave autistic daughter who took her own life after spending eight months in a locked psychiatric unit six hours from her family home
Lindsey Bridges, 43, believes her daughter, Lauren, 20, was failed by the mental health system after spending four years locked in six different psychiatric units
Lindsey said: Being an inpatient has robbed me of my daughter, my son of his sister, my parents of their granddaughter and most importantly it has taken away Lauren’s life
I’ve absolutely broken because of this, I’m lost without her
When she went went into hospital I made a promise to her
I promised I’d never give up fighting for her, no matter what
We often spoke about how we would change the world once she was well enough to help me
She hated the system and how it was failing everyone around her
Lindsey says the NHS Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) and adult mental health teams failed to provide appropriate community support for her daughter who was struggling with day to day life and her grief after the death of her younger brother when she was eight-years-old
Lindsey, an integrated urgent care health advisor and hair extensionist, from Bournemouth said: Lauren first asked for help dealing with her mental health when she was 14 and when no support came her struggle escalated
She had severe anxiety and OCD
She also had Asperger’s but wasn’t diagnosed until she was 17
The opportunity for early intervention was missed for Lauren
If there was more support available when we first asked for it I believe things would never have got so bad
Lauren has had to put up with a lot in her short life
When she was just eight years old, her little brother, Alfie died from Mitochondrial disease, she watched him suffer for two and a half years
Her OCD rituals were often about protecting her family
Lauren first went into a psychiatric unit voluntarily on 31 Oct 2018 to receive therapy
But her mum says after a few weeks no therapy materialised and without a plan in place Lauren became very frustrated, felt trapped and her self-harming got progressively worse
Lindsey said: She would self harm while she was being watched by the healthcare professionals, much more than we could ever have imagined and more severe than we had seen before
Lauren was missing her family so much and got worse simply by being in hospital and not having any treatment
From October 2018 to February 2022 Lauren was an inpatient at six facilities
Lindsey said: For years she has been locked away, often not seeing daylight or offered exercise for weeks on end, with no plan to meet her needs psychiatrically
And little or no therapy or therapeutic activities to stimulate her
It was a battle to make sure her basic human rights were being met on a daily basis
On occasions, due to Lauren’s frustration of the system and being locked away 24/7 she has been sent to an adult unit and put in total seclusion without even a bed, just a ground sheet to sleep on
She deserved the best and sadly was ripped away from her family time and time again and placed in settings that were like torture for her
She’s been treated worse than a criminal at times
All we wanted was the correct care and treatment package to allow her to come home for good, with me, where she belongs instead we had to make do with short contact visits and two video calls a day
Lindsey says Lauren was a straight A student who aspired to be a doctor or a paediatric nurse
She added: Lauren and I were exceptionally close
Our bond was absolutely unbreakable
We were massively failed by the mental health system
Right now over 2000 people with a Learning Disability and/or Autism remain locked in inpatient units
Often they are far from family and at an increased risk of abuse
Lauren was one of these people
Together we have been fighting for the correct care and treatment package but sadly it didn’t come quick enough
After being detained under the mental health act and sent to a unit six hours away in Manchester in June last year Lauren’s mental health declined rapidly
She suffered terribly from separation anxiety and hated being so far away from me
It broke her and our little family
She wasn’t just my daughter, she was my best friend
She passed away on Thursday 24th February after her heart stopped beating for well over an hour
Doctors kept her alive until 11
32am on 26th February 2022 to see if she could be a suitable organ donor
Now she has gone to join her baby brother Alfie in Heaven but she leaves behind her other brother Bobby, her Grandparents, her dad, James, uncles and aunties, godparents, special friends, girlfriend and her very special cousins
Her beautiful smile, kind heart and pure courage and strength touched the hearts of everyone who met her
In memory of Lauren, Lindsey is proposing the introduction of some changes to significantly enhance the lives of vulnerable children and young adults who are being detained under the mental health act
Lindsey's petition has attracted over 5000 signatures already
Lindsey said: No children or adults with autism should be detained under the mental health act or sent to psychiatric hospitals out of area, far away from home
No child or adult should be left in an unsuitable hospital setting that is detrimental for their well-being
Lauren was left alone, far from home, in an environment that was causing more harm than good
I believe if my proposals were already in place, my daughter would still be alive
We would like to express our sincere condolences to Lauren’s family and friends at this difficult time
A Dorset HealthCare spokesperson said: While we cannot comment on individual circumstances, we can say that we do endeavour to support all patients who are being cared for by our mental health services and in the community so they can lead safe and fulfilling lives
Where patients or their families feel they have not received the support they expect we work with them and do our best to address their concerns Out-of-area placements are always used only as a last resort by services, either when we are at full capacity or when a person has very complex needs and requires specialist care not available within Dorset
We have always been committed to reducing the need for out-of-area placements, in line with the NHS Long Term Plan, and over the past few years we have undertaken an extensive programme of work to achieve this

All we wanted was the correct care and treatment package to allow her to come home for good, with me, where she belongs instead we had to make do with short contact visits and two video calls a day
Lindsey says Lauren was a straight A student who aspired to be a doctor or a paediatric nurse
She added: Lauren and I were exceptionally close
Our bond was absolutely unbreakable
We were massively failed by the mental health system
Right now over 2000 people with a Learning Disability and/or Autism remain locked in inpatient units
Often they are far from family and at an increased risk of abuse
Lauren was one of these people
Together we have been fighting for the correct care and treatment package but sadly it didn’t come quick enough
After being detained under the mental health act and sent to a unit six hours away in Manchester in June last year Lauren’s mental health declined rapidly
She suffered terribly from separation anxiety and hated being so far away from me
It broke her and our little family
She wasn’t just my daughter, she was my best friend
She passed away on Thursday 24th February after her heart stopped beating for well over an hour
Doctors kept her alive until 11
32am on 26th February 2022 to see if she could be a suitable organ donor
Now she has gone to join her baby brother Alfie in Heaven but she leaves behind her other brother Bobby, her Grandparents, her dad, James, uncles and aunties, godparents, special friends, girlfriend and her very special cousins
Her beautiful smile, kind heart and pure courage and strength touched the hearts of everyone who met her
In memory of Lauren, Lindsey is proposing the introduction of some changes to significantly enhance the lives of vulnerable children and young adults who are being detained under the mental health act
Lindsey's petition has attracted over 5000 signatures already
Lindsey said: No children or adults with autism should be detained under the mental health act or sent to psychiatric hospitals out of area, far away from home
No child or adult should be left in an unsuitable hospital setting that is detrimental for their well-being
Lauren was left alone, far from home, in an environment that was causing more harm than good
I believe if my proposals were already in place, my daughter would still be alive
We would like to express our sincere condolences to Lauren’s family and friends at this difficult time
A Dorset HealthCare spokesperson said: While we cannot comment on individual circumstances, we can say that we do endeavour to support all patients who are being cared for by our mental health services and in the community so they can lead safe and fulfilling lives
Where patients or their families feel they have not received the support they expect we work with them and do our best to address their concerns Out-of-area placements are always used only as a last resort by services, either when we are at full capacity or when a person has very complex needs and requires specialist care not available within Dorset
We have always been committed to reducing the need for out-of-area placements, in line with the NHS Long Term Plan, and over the past few years we have undertaken an extensive programme of work to achieve this

Kieran, from Walsall, had increasingly isolated himself following relationship problems according to his sister and moved into shared accommodation rather than ask friends for help A sister whose golden-hearted brother took his own life hopes his death will help other men address their own mental health
Kieran Huntington took his own life last week despite appearing to be in good spirits, according to his older sister Danielle
Danielle says that 25-year-old Kieran had been dealing with ongoing mental health issues following the death of his mum when he was 17
She says Kieran, from Walsall, had increasingly isolated himself following relationship problems and moved into shared accommodation rather than seek help from family and friends
And now Danielle, 29, wants to use her family's tragedy to encourage men who are dealing with difficult circumstances to speak out
Birmingham Live reports that the alarm was raised for Kieran's welfare on Sunday, August 14, after his loved ones became concerned for him
Danielle, originally from Walsall but now living in Stafford, said: The ambulance turned up first, they did try resuscitation, the police and ambulance were in attendance
Instead of asking people for a place to stay, he felt like, as a man, he should have the responsibility for himself and moved into a house share
When he was 17, our mother died
He never sought help to move on from our mum's death
He struggled with it for the last few years
He was always just plodding along and carried on
Danielle hopes the death of her brother will shine a light on mental health and encourage other men who are struggling to seek help
Men should be more open and talk more, express their feelings more and don't keep them bottled up, she said
Whether that is to do with relationship problems, work problems, any problem that they have got, no matter how small or big, just talk about it rather than bottle it up inside
Kieran was a boyhood Liverpool fan and supported Walsall, which was his local team
He also played football and enjoyed fishing
He was a plasterer by trade but also played an active role in the family's dog training business DC K9
Danielle said Kieran was a popular young man with hundreds of friends, adding: I have been speaking to lots of people and they were saying he was laughing and joking all the time, even recently
He had hundreds and hundreds of friends
Paying tribute to her brother, she said: He was all-round nice, sometimes too nice
He would give his last penny to anybody that would need it

Murder victim Stephen Cameron's dad Kenneth Cameron, who had been fighting depression since his wife Toni passed away, took his own life just hours after his dog died The dad of a man stabbed to death by road-rage gangster Kenneth Noye killed himself just hours after his dog died, an inquest has found
Kenneth Cameron, 75, grief-stricken by the murder of Stephen, 21, and the death of wife Toni, 73, downed paracetamol and whisky
The overdose was triggered by the death of his dog
Mr Cameron’s brother, Gary, had spoken to him on the night the pet died
But 24 hours later Gary found Mr Cameron, who lived alone, on the floor of his retirement home flat
He died on March 15 in hospital in Ashford, Kent
A coroner said Mr Cameron had been racked with depression since the 2016 death of retired nurse Toni
He was also haunted by the 2019 release of Noye, 75, 19 years into a life sentence for murdering Stephen on a M25 sliproad in Swanley, Kent
Recording a verdict of suicide, coroner Katrina Hepburn said: Mr Cameron’s mental health had been deteriorating since the death of his wife
He had been particularly hit by the death of his dog
When his brother went to see him he was found unconscious in his flat
Mr Cameron suffered a cardiac shock and had been diagnosed with heart disease, asthma and prostate cancer, the inquest heard
He had a heart attack in 2017 and said he was upset that he had survived it
In a statement to the inquest, consultant Dr Debkuma Pandit said he gathered Mr Cameron’s family together as his condition worsened
Dr Pandit said: His family mentioned that he was depressed for many years and that the death of his dog was the trigger for his suicide attempt
Toni died in 2016 after catching her arm on a bush in the garden and contracting a superbug
Her ashes were interred at Stephen’s grave
Ken said: They were so close in life that it seemed right to put them together in death
The couple had campaigned to keep their son’s killer behind bars
Noye became Britain’s most wanted man when he went on the run after the 1996 murder
Get all the latest news sent to your inbox
Sign up for the free Mirror newsletter It sparked an international manhunt and he was arrested two years later when Stephen’s fiancee, Danielle Cable, helped identify Noye in a Spanish restaurant
In 2020 he was seen at the spot where he stabbed Stephen
Mr Cameron said: It’s like Noye’s walking on Stephen’s grave
I feel sickened he has gone back to the place where he took my son’s life
Noye previously served a 14-year sentence for handling gold bullion from the £26
3million Brink’s-Mat robbery in 1983
Danielle, who was just 17 at the time of the murder, is still under the witness protection scheme

WARNING DISTRESSING CONTENT: A mum who plunged to her death searched for the means of taking her own life the day before she did
Raquel Wilkins' death was ruled a murder-suicide A woman who calmly looked her boyfriend in the eye as she fell to her death off a balcony holding their son looked up easy suicide on Google before she died
Raquel Wilkins, 40, was killed with her two-year-old son Denzel Wilkins-Browning when she stepped off a high point of the Petco arena, a baseball stadium in downtown San Diego, California, in the US
The San Diego Police ruled her death on September 29 a murder -suicide after the six-storey fall killed both Raquel and Denzel
The family of Raquel contested the ruling and one witness said that while standing on a bench she again lost her balance and this time, fell over the edge
She had already been seen on the bench and nearly losing her balance
They added: From my vantage point, looking at her back, it was almost like she rolled over the railing
Her sudden decision to fall seemed odd as the pair were seen happy and laughing on the day and the family's attorney claimed the ruling was useful for the owners of the stadium, as reported by the San Diego Tribune
He claimed: The city of San Diego owns that ballpark, it is legally responsible, assuming that what caused her to fall was anything but her intent
The only way the city is not at fault is if she intended to kill herself and her baby
Lieutenant Andra Brown said the police had come to the murder-suicide conclusion after detectives conducted a thorough and comprehensive investigation that included dozens of interviews, reviewing of available video footage, and collecting background information to determine what led to the deaths
The boyfriend of Raquel contests the idea that her death was an accident and said it was very intentional, very planned
Christopher Browning said she all of a sudden stared straight at him with an eerie silence, like in a movie
It was so quick, so fast, he added to the New York Post
Both of them went over.  It was very quiet
I was in complete shock
Another witness backed up Christopher's claims in a police report and argued the act was completely intentional
Her demeanour walking up was so calm
She didn’t even look down
It looked just like she was trying to hop over a fence
Raquel's mental state in the months leading up to her death had reportedly deteriorated and had broken down in front of her boyfriend before
She had searched for tips for taking her own life on her phone the day before
To grieve in a healthy way, you have to honour the truth, Christopher said

An investigation has been launched into a mother's claims that her 14-year-old autistic daughter was strip-searched by Metropolitan Police officers A 15-year-old girl was left traumatised and suicidal after she was strip-searched by Met Police, according to her mum
The girl's mother claims her autistic daughter was strip-searched by Metropolitan Police officers
An investigation has been launched after the force confirmed the mum had made a complaint after she said the teenager was left traumatised and tried to kill herself
The mixed-race girl, whom the broadcaster referred to as Olivia, was said to have been out with friends when they argued
The two boys phoned the police alleging that the group had attempted to rob them at knifepoint
The report comes after a backlash over revelations that a 15-year-old girl, known as Child Q, was strip-searched by female Metropolitan Police officers in 2020 in the knowledge she was menstruating - after she was wrongly suspected of carrying cannabis at her east London school
Olivia's mother, whom the BBC referred to as Lisa, told BBC Radio 4's File On 4 programme that officers searched Olivia and her friends at the scene and the group were arrested in December 2020
Lisa said she told the officers on the phone that her daughter had autism and learning difficulties, and had been self-harming
Olivia was held in custody for more than 20 hours before being found to be in possession of a sharpened stick and a small blade, which her mother said was for the purpose of self-harming
The discovery, Lisa said, prompted six officers to forcibly strip Olivia and carry out an intimate search in the presence of male police
The youngster was then handcuffed and strip-searched, Lisa said
The mum said: Olivia was actually on her period at the time too
And they cut off her underwear in front of these grown male officers
She was absolutely distraught
Lisa told the broadcaster the experience had a devastating impact on her daughter's mental health
She added: She spent a lot of time in her room and she continued to self-harm in secret
And then, a few weeks later, she attempted suicide
The BBC reported Olivia later appeared in court accused of possession of a bladed weapon and was found not guilty after magistrates accepted the items were used for self-harming
Her family are bringing a civil case against the Met and are being represented by lawyer Gail Hadfield Granger, who has been contacted for comment
A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said: We have received a complaint from the girl's mother, which is currently under investigation
We have also received notification of a potential civil claim and therefore are unable to comment further at this stage
Deputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor told File On 4 that strip-searches help to keep children safe while in custody
He said: (The) worst-case scenario would be that we stop strip-searching in its entirety and a young child dies in custody because they are in possession of a knife or drugs that they use to harm themselves

Five Acre Wood, a special school in Maidstone, Kent, has admitted to breaking its own policies and government guidelines by repeatedly strapping two autistic twins, Samuel and Jacob Montague, into chairs to restrict their movement A school that repeatedly strapped two autistic students into chairs to restrict their movement has apologised after a court ruled it breached their human rights
Five Acre Wood, a school for children with special education needs, has admitted breaking its own policy and government guidance by using mechanical restraints on twins Samuel and Jacob Montague
The twins, who are both severely autistic and non-verbal, started at the school in 2009 aged four, with the intention of attending until age 19
They are now both 17
But their parents Annie and Mark pulled them out in 2013 after realising staff were strapping the boys into chairs despite objections and protests
Kent County Council, which runs the school in Maidstone, has offered their parents more than £80,000 compensation after a civil court case
Now Annie and Mark are calling for changes to the law to make it clearer the restraints should not be used against children like Samuel and Jacob
In a statement issued after the settlement, they said: Children with special educational needs should be protected, not strapped into chairs
It has been a long, difficult process, but it has been our privilege to be the voice for Samuel and Jacob
They, and other children with autism or learning disabilities, deserve the full protection of the law
Local authorities should be on their side, empowering their lives, instead of using restrictive practices like restraints that can cause trauma and harm
Now that the case is over, and Samuel and Jacob are safe and thriving, we look forward to campaigning to stop the use of restraints against children with special educational needs
The first public incident took place in 2010, when the boys were wheeled out at a school concert strapped into the 'Hardrock' chairs
The chairs restrain movement through a number of straps that go around legs, arms, and shoulders
When their parents protested, they were told the mechanical restraint chairs were the only way the boys could participate in the concert and their use was a one-off
Despite this, the couple became concerned that Samuel and Jacob were being routinely restrained while at the school
And in June 2011, a clinical psychologist visited and witnessed one of the boys strapped into the Hardrock chairs in the classroom
On one occasion the boys' mother and their carer attended a school sports day where other children were outside and running around
But Jacob was strapped into the chair and visibly distressed
The boys' autism means they interpret the world through touch and movement, so the use of the chairs completely undermined their human rights, Annie and Mark argued
After they took Samuel and Jacob out of the school, they home-schooled them and the boys have since flourished
The couple brought a civil case under the Human Rights Act against the council
They argued the restraints had been used unlawfully as the school failed to consider less restrictive options and failed to put in place a plan to reduce the use of restraints
The school admitted a raft of failings and admitted the use of straps and trays on the specialist chairs could restrict movement and amount to mechanical restraint
They admitted the restraint took place while the boys were at school and without their parents' agreement, which was a breach of the school's policy and national guidance
Annie and Mark added: We only sought legal redress after many years trying to get answers from Kent County Council
This case was never about financial compensation; it was about trying to stop these practices happening to other children up and down the country
What is happening where you live? Find out by adding your postcode
Solicitor Catriona Rubens, who represented the Montague family, said: Samuel and Jacob were active, sensory seeking children who, because of their autism, interpret the world through movement and touch
It is our view that, by strapping them into mechanical restraint chairs at school, the local authority breached their human rights and failed to deliver any therapeutic benefit to the twins
We welcome Kent County Council's sincere apology and recognition that it failed Samuel and Jacob in this case
The success of Samuel and Jacob's case is a testament to the many years their parents spent fighting to get answers from the local authority about the use of restraint against their sons
A spokesman for the council said in a statement that it sincerely apologises for any harm, distress and/or pain and suffering that were caused to Samuel and Jacob and to their parents as a result of these failures

Manchester United fan Robert Davies, 33, had been partying in Blackpool and joking with family in the days and weeks leading up to his death A photo of a dad-of-two taken weeks before he took his life shows the signs aren't always clear, his family has said
Manchester United fan Robert Davies, 33, had been partying in Blackpool and joking with family in the days and weeks leading up to his death
Now his mum and sisters want others to see the pictures of an outwardly happy young man to raise awareness
Speaking to WalesOnline bereft mother Rachel said her home in Crickhowell feels empty since Robert's death
His family says support was lacking throughout his struggles and that while he received treatment for alcohol addiction they were never given a direct line for a support worker
Rachel says she's also struggled to find bereavement support and has had to resort to Facebook community groups
Robert is described as fun-loving and as mischievous as anything
The only thing the popular window cleaner adored more than football and his team Manchester United were his family and friends
But on November 30 he took his life days after enjoying a holiday in Blackpool and sharing photos of his trip with his girlfriend on social media
At home with her seven cats, three dogs, and 14-year-old daughter, Rachel points to the corner of the room beside her which is now Robert’s corner
His ashes sit in the middle of ornamental robins, candles, and a small glass house which reads: Special son, your light will shine forever inside our broken hearts
Her lounge is crammed with pictures of him - some with his two children aged 10 and four
Robbie is here with me forever, Rachel, 52, said.  I do believe that
They always say when robins appear, loved ones are near
Life is empty here now, that’s how I’d describe it
The only joy I get is when my grandchildren come to stay
How do you carry on doing normal daily things when you feel your life has come to a halt? It’s just day by day, or even minute by minute sometimes
It’s the waking up in the morning when you forget for a second that he’s not here, that’s the worst part, she said
Flicking through countless photos of her son, she continued: I would genuinely say he was one of the happiest and most outgoing people for much of his life
A super-friendly person who would walk into a group of people he wouldn’t know and would come out with many friends
Rachel smiles and laughs as she recalls funny memories which she now cherishes more than ever
At his nan’s birthday party only days before he died he brought out a cake for her with candles that didn’t blow out
He found it hilarious watching her trying everything to get these candles to stop
That sums up the type of person he was
It also shows how anyone can find themselves at their lowest ebb within days and when their family might least expect it, she says
Even in the days prior to his death Robert’s relatives said he had appeared to be as happy as he’d been in a long time, and had even decided to take his girlfriend on holiday
A picture taken of Robert in Blackpool shows him the week before he took his life, and it’s a picture Rachel wants others to see
Looking at the photo, she explained: By that point I think he definitely was suffering mentally and he tried to mask it with drink
He’d often drink a bottle of vodka a day which I’d put water in without him knowing
But he did seem to have become better prior to his death
He did seem to have picked himself up and then he’d have a bad week where he’d be really down
His friends would often say how they felt he was getting there, but maybe he was putting on a show to make people think he was okay
I want others to be aware that there are not always clear signs
The story about his nan not being able to blow the candles out was days before he died
The photos in Blackpool were taken a week before
By the time of his death Robert had worked hard to build his window cleaning business in Brecon and enjoyed speaking with locals - particularly those older than himself
The older folk really loved him, he’d spend half the time having tea and coffee with them, Rachel went on
He came home telling us all about them and the stories he’d heard
He’d often sit with them during the lockdowns to keep them company
It does show it can happen to anyone and that’s the saddest part
People don’t think this will ever happen to them or to anyone they know
A year before he died he’d have been the person in my life I’d have worried about the least
When his mental health dipped in the spring of 2021 Robert moved back in with Rachel, and she says they spent his final months watching copious amounts of sport on the television, sometimes until the early hours of the morning, to occupy his mind
He became my little boy again, she recalled
The night before he died Robert had fallen asleep drunk on the sofa
Rachel rang the doctors the following morning after he had told her he felt he wanted to take his life
She says she still feels guilty that she didn’t call the emergency services, but she feels let down that she wasn’t prepared for that moment
She claims Robert wasn’t offered any support other than for his alcohol dependency, even though he’d sometimes told specialists that he wanted to take his life in the months before he died
I rang the doctors and they said they’d call me back, but by the time they rang me back an hour and a half later Robert was dead, Rachel said
Not only did Robert not get enough support but we as a family didn’t get the support we needed
If we’d had appropriate guidance we’d have known what to do when Robert told us he wanted to take his life
We were in contact with mental health specialists but we were never given a direct number to contact or guidance on what to do in that scenario
There was no face to face support during Covid either
Everything was done over the phone - even the counselling for Robert for his problems with alcohol which he started in the March [of 2021]
He needed face to face help
On the morning of his death Robert told his mum he was planning on driving away from the house when she went to drop off her grandson at school, to which Rachel told him he couldn’t because he had been drinking
When I came back from dropping Jaxson off I was relieved to see Robert’s car still outside, she remembered
I knew he’d gone to his room when I got in the house but that was normal when he was particularly down
Sometimes he would go to bed and sleep the day away
I thought he was safe up there and that there was nothing up there that he could hurt himself with
I was heading up the stairs to tell him I’d rang the doctors when the police knocked on the door and said they were doing a welfare check
Then I was told he’d rang his ex-partner and friend to tell them he wanted to kill himself
They finally got his door open and told me to ring an ambulance
I felt completely numb, but I honestly thought he’d be okay
The paramedics and police worked on him for 40 minutes before telling me he’d gone
It didn’t feel real and still doesn’t feel real
How can you believe that someone who had been so full of life could be gone like that? I still think he’s going to walk through the door
How do you accept that your little boy is gone? Since Robert died Rachel says specialist support has also been few and far between and she's had to seek help on Facebook
She says there are lengthy waiting lists just for an initial phone call and charities are becoming overstretched
Robert’s sister Parisse said: There’s a serious lack of help for anyone these days
We need to encourage everyone, especially men, that there is no shame in speaking about your feelings
Too many young men are struggling in silence, we need to support one another

Matthew Langley was so malnourished his bones were visible through his skin after being left locked up and neglected by Craig and Lorna Hewitt for seven months
The shocking conditions an autistic man who was found 'close to death' after being held captive by his mum and stepdad have been revealed as the couple face jail
Matthew Langley was so malnourished his bones were visible through his skin after being left locked up and neglected by Craig and Lorna Hewitt for seven months
The pair were last week found guilty of false imprisonment after Sheffield Crown Court heard 22-year-old Matthew was found weighing just 6st (38kg)in a faeces and vomit-strewn bedroom
South Yorkshire Police have now released a grim photograph showing piles of rubbish and soiled items
It lays bare the shocking squalor that Matthew had been held in by the Hewitts, who kept the door locked
The court heard police found faeces and vomit over the floor and bedding along with buzzing flies, a bad smell and a key on the outside of the door
The National Autistic Society said the scene was deeply disturbing
Matthew, who also had learning difficulties, suffered from irritable bowel syndrome, double incontinence and arthritis, the court heard
Jurors heard Matthew was found by paramedics seriously underweight, dehydrated and 'with his life hanging in the balance' on June 2, 2020
Nicholas Campbell QC, prosecuting, told the trial the ambulance service was called to the home in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, in the early hours of June 2, 2020
Matthew was rushed to a hospital intensive care unit in a pitiable state with abrasions indicating he had been moving around on all fours, the prosecutor told the court
He had suffered damage to a kidney with high sodium levels relating to severe dehydration, it was heard
Mr Campbell added: His sodium levels were dangerously high.  They measured 180
They were so high they could shut down his brain and kill him
Anything above 145, there is a real chance of death
The Home Office pathologist examined the injuries and said the abrasions and bruises were consistent in his view with Matthew having been crawling on all fours over objects in his path
Mr Campbell said Matthew made a good physical recovery thanks to the hard work of medical professionals and when he was discharged from hospital he weighed 55kg
Craig Hewitt told police his wife Lorna had found Matthew upstairs lying on the floor and he claimed Matthew had been fed and that he ate in his room, the court heard
He also claimed there had been locks on the internal doors because their home used to be a student accommodation
Mr Hewitt stated to police that his stepson Matthew had only been locked in at night because he would go downstairs and set off security alarms
Lorna Hewitt chose to give no comment answers to all questions asked by the police, the court heard
The Hewitts, of Sheffield, South Yorks, were also found guilty of causing or allowing a vulnerable adult to suffer serious physical harm
The couple are due to be sentenced on Friday, February 18

Billy Baxter, 16, from Blackburn, needed life-saving surgery after being knifed in the heart and lungs and now has a 12-inch scar running down the length of his chest An autistic teen who stayed inside his home for over 2 years due to social anxiety was brutally stabbed while venturing out for just the second time
Billy Baxter, 16, from Blackburn, was knifed in the heart and lungs on the evening of September 17 last year while walking near his home in what is believed to be a row over a girl
He had to undergo life-saving surgery after the attack and has since been left with a 12-inch scar running down the length of his chest
His mum Jessie Brian, 35, found out about the attack when Billy messaged her on Snapchat to say he was on his way to hospital
She said the teen had been left traumatised by the incident and the family now plans to move out of the area
His 17 year-old attacker - who cannot be named for legal reasons - was sentenced to just 28 months in custody for the offence last week
He was originally charged with attempted murder but this was downgraded to wounding with intent by the Crown Prosecution Service
Jessie hit out at the sentence, calling it a slap on the wrist while Billy had been forced to turn his back on his life and ambitions
Billy wanted to be a plumber and now he's too scared to go out of the house just when he got his confidence back, she said
It's heart-breaking what he's done to my son, and in court, he held his head up high like nothing had happened
I've been around this area for 35 years - it's the only area that I've known - and now we have to leave because the attacker knows my address and so does his family
Billy has ADHD and autism and had spent more than two years without leaving his girlfriend's house due to his lifelong developmental disability
But they broke up shortly before the attack on September 17 last year and Billy moved back home with Jessie
He was ambushed after leaving the house at around 6
45pm to meet up with a new love interest
Jessie said: He'd been in a relationship, and he'd found out she was cheating on him, so he came back home after isolating with her for two and a half years
I said to Billy, Just get out there! You need to start socialising with people and making new friends
Forget about everything that's happened
So he'd met this young girl, and managed to get to town and to see her, but then he heard his name being shouted across the road
He put his hood down and didn't want any trouble, but next thing he knew the lad was in front of his face, and he got stabbed straight in the chest
Jessie said she found out about the stabbing after Billy contacted her over messaging platform Snapchat in the minutes after it took place
She said: I got a phone call from one of his friends on Snapchat, and it was actually Billy on the phone saying that he had been stabbed
I thought it was someone having a joke because it didn't sound like Billy
It was only when he said: It is me, mum, I've been stabbed and I'm on my way to the hospital, that's when I found out
Billy was rushed to hospital where he required a life-saving operation after doctors found out he had internal bleeding
Jessie said: He was stabbed in the chest, between his heart and his liver
It pierced his heart, as well as cutting through a tube that runs from his heart for the blood supply, and slashing his liver
They had to open him up and pull his rib cage back and do an operation on his heart, and they had to repair the tube as well
It was an operation that he had to have within 24 hours - a life-saving operation - because he had internal bleeding as well, which is very, very dangerous
She added: It was a nightmare to tell you the truth, it really was a nightmare
Billy was left with a huge scar running down his chest, along with a couple of smaller ones dotted just above his stomach
But Jessie said that the poor lad was also left with mental trauma, which continues to this day
She said: My 16-year-old who wanted to go to college and be a plumber hasn't got a life now because he won't go out
He feels very conscious about the scars
He talks about it every single day
It's not just one little scar
It's one big massive scar and two scars underneath it
Jessie also feels the sentence that her son's attacker received won't deter other kids from carrying knives in the future
She said: 28 months is a slap on the hand
This boy who did all this will probably get out and get a job or whatever, and my son is left not knowing what to do next

Residents living above Faith in Strangers in Margate, Kent, were unaware that the venue would eventually become a live music venue on weekend evenings, they claim The parents of a two-year-old autistic boy have claimed they have been forced to move out of their apartment due to the nightclub below blasting loud music into the early hours
Residents living above Faith in Strangers in Margate, Kent, were unaware that the venue, which was originally a creative co-working space that hosted poetry nights and academic talks, would eventually become a live music venue on weekend evenings
But after lockdown, residents of the block of 12 flats above the venue have claimed weekends have become a nightmare with bosses having revealed that it could become a live music venue on Fridays and Saturdays
And a mum-of-two, Rosie-Mae Deal, told how she has been brought to tears by the ridiculously loud music that was causing a huge amount of distress to her autistic son
One night I sat crying in my home knowing I can’t do anything about this ridiculously loud music thumping through my flat, waking my children up, upsetting my little boy, who has autism so is very sensitive to sounds, she said
He sleeps in my bed because he’s scared
He covers his ears, he cries, he screams under his covers
Rosie-Mae said the family should be able to feel safe and at peace in their own home
Another elderly resident, Ethelbert Crescent, has suggested the noise is bad due to it not having the correct soundproofing to manage the loud music
Ethelbert, who is in her 80s, explained that the blaring noise is affecting her health and had prompted her to avoid staying in her own home
When Georgina Powell and her partner moved into an apartment in the same block of flats, , they had been drawn to the idea of the arts hub that they could use on their doorstep
Georgina said that the concept of the space had sounded amazing
But now, she and her partner - whose flat is directly above the venue - have now been forced to move out, and are now paying rent on top of their mortgage
Georgina compared parties held in the flat to the noise held in Fabric nightclub, with the floor vibrating and the couple able to hear every word to Madonna
Various noise complaints were logged by the Thanet District Council last year, prompting an application to review the licence to be submitted
According to the council's environment and health team, the venue has not always adhered to their 11pm noise curfew

More measures were potentially necessary not to disturb the neighbours
However, 130 letters of support have reportedly been sent in favour of the venue, which some locals have called key to the community in the area
Representatives from eight of the 12 flats appealing to the council will appear in a council hearing due to take place on Thursday
Faith in Strangers has been unable to comment until a ruling is decided

Paula Halliday, 33, worked as an auxiliary nurse and after a number of failings from health services she took her own life as she struggled with a traumatic event where something happened in London A young mum has tragically taken her own life after a number of failings from medical services as she experienced a traumatic event the year before in London
Paula Halliday had struggled with her mental health and hadn’t seen her two young girls since the incident in October 2021
In the time since, on a number of occasions, she took overdoses and said she wanted to kill herself, Lancs Live reported
The 33-year-old from High Wycombe was being seen by mental health services - but a number of failings meant she didn’t receive the care she should have
When she killed herself, her body was found by her then partner and she had left a number of notes including one that simply read: It’s my time
An inquest into her death at Preston Crown Court heard how the auxiliary nurse began seeing Amy Cooper in September 2021
Speaking to the inquest, Miss Cooper said: I rang the crisis team once when she was texting me at night because she was just beside herself and I didn't know what to do
She was drinking a lot, every day
In October 2021 something happened in London and she was quite traumatised by it
She was seeing someone from the mental health team every week and they would ring her every other day to check in on her but she felt let down by them and said they weren't listening to her
She was always seeing someone different so she kept having to go over what happened every time and she found that really distressing
Samantha Ferguson, a matron at Lancashire Care which is part of Lancashire and South Cumbria NHS Foundation Trust which provides mental health services, admitted there had been several failings in Paula's care
The inquest heard that the team had been unwilling to start any psychiatric treatment or medication until Paula managed to reduce her alcohol intake
The matron said: Handovers weren't always fully completed and risks weren't always discussed.  It was sporadic
Some people had to look through the notes to familiarise themselves with her
She saw a number of different people at her face-to-face appointments which isn't ideal
What we would have liked to have been better was not necessarily more face-to-face appointments but better documented telephone calls and the ability to escalate a higher evidence of risk
And more face-to-face contact would have been expected given the high level of risk

The inquest, which was attended by a large number of Paula's friends and relatives, heard that a number of changes have been brought in at the trust
This included plans to increase staffing and issuing stricter guidance when handing over patients during morning meetings
Staff have also been trained on the importance of clinical curiosity, documenting clinical history and risk assessments
Claire Gibson, a consultant nurse at LSCFT, apologised to Paula's family for the failings in her care
She added: I want to apologise because there were some failings and I am really sorry
On the morning of January 13 this year Miss Cooper had driven to Paula's house to pick her up and take her to work
Although Paula hadn't replied to any of her texts this was normal given how heavily Paula had been drinking

Amy then went inside the house in Morecambe where she found Paula dead
Returning a conclusion of suicide Area Coroner Richard Taylor said he was satisfied that Paula had done a deliberate act with the intention of ending her life
Of course she was high risk and her frustrations about not getting the treatment she wanted are understandable, he added
In the notes she left she wasn't rambling
It was thought out and considered
The fact that so many people are here today goes to show how much she is missed and loved
A page on GoFundMe set up after Paula's death raised £730 in her name for the NSPCC
Friends posted their tributes to her in the comments with one describing her as a very special person while another said she was a beautiful lady

Retired police officer and dad-of-three Haydn Morgan said his beloved daughter Bronwen, 26, suffered a devastating injustice in relation to her mental health care while she trained to be a psychiatric nurse at Cardiff University Parents who camped outside their beloved daughter's room to stop her harming herself have shared their heartbreak after she tragically took her own life
Haydn Morgan and his wife Jayne took it in turns to sleep on a camper bed against the door of their 26-year-old daughteer Bronwen's room so she wouldn't escape, self-harm or take her own life
Dad-of-three Haydn said his daughter - who was studying to be a mental health nurse at Cardiff University - didn't like it, but they couldn't let her out of our sight because of the risk she posed to herself
He added: It was the only way we could keep her safe
Haydn - who says his daughter suffered a devastating injustice in her care - said he and his wife fought for Bronwen to be admitted to a psychiatric war but it was always refused
He said: We just didn't know where to turn
It had all been so different just a few years earlier
Growing up Bronwen Morgan was a talented swimmer, played the piano and was a popular Girl Guide
She also loved working with children and had a natural way of connecting with them
Before long she found herself a job in the behavioural unit at her old primary school where she earned the nickname Bomb-proof Bron as she was always calm and in control under pressure
But during her time in Cardiff University, where she was training to become a mental health nurse, her own bouts of anxiety and depression intensified and she developed an eating disorder
Her problems were further exacerbated by the pandemic when the usual activities she needed to manage her mental health disappeared virtually overnight
This coincided with the services of her community psychiatric nurse (CPN) being taken away without warning
Haydn, a dad-of-three, added that Bronwen would frequently be detained by police under the Mental Health Act and sent to Hafan Y Coed, a specialist psychiatric unit on the grounds of University Hospital Llandough
However he claims she would often be discharged from the unit without the family knowing which led to her going missing
Bronwen began to feel helpless and isolated which meant her mental health spiralled out of control and left her in a place that she felt she could not find a way back from, added Haydn, from Cyncoed, Cardiff
After many months of pain and trauma, Bronwen was allegedly told by medical staff that if she were to find herself in a crisis in the future, the police would arrest her
This decision, her family claims, was the final straw
Haydn, a retired police officer, admitted that he has struggled to shake the memory of the last day he saw Bronwen alive
He recalled: That week she was happy, smiling and in a really good place
We hadn't seen her like that for ages
Unbeknown to us she had this plan to take her own life
In a way she was saying goodbye to us, but nobody knew
She had been trying to do it for a long time
We've been told she was probably feeling a sense of elation and a sense of knowing that 'I'm going to take my life and my family will be able to get on with their lives'
Bronwen was found unresponsive at a hotel in Cardiff and died on Thursday, August 27, 2020
As well as writing to Cardiff and Vale University Health Board in a last-ditch cry for help, she penned a letter to her mum, dad and two younger sisters, Tesni and Cerys
She said she wanted us to know that she had the best childhood ever and that we'd done nothing wrong
It was just heartbreaking, added Haydn
We had literally lost all hope
We couldn't find a way of going forward and her mental health team had locked her in this cocoon and insisted that this was the therapy she should be having
Haydn, who is now seeing a therapist himself, added: Now I'm retired, you see photographs of her around the house all the time and it brings it all back
I've been miserable, tired and angry - I think we all have
Her heartbroken family claims that if they had been given more of a say in her care - which would have led to a more tailored and bespoke approach - she could still be alive today
They said Bronwen experienced a devastating injustice in her care and was treated with a blanket approach which had little effect on improving her mental health
Since the tragedy, Bronwen's family have set up Bronwen's Wish, a charity which aims to provide safe spaces for young people experiencing challenges with their mental health
It aims to provide wellbeing pods in primary and secondary schools which will act as quiet, relaxing and safe places for pupils who want to talk about their mental health
In June, Haydn and his dog Celog plan to walk the entire Pembrokeshire coastal path in one go - the equivalent distance to climbing Everest - to raise money for Bronwen's Wish
To donate to the challenge, dubbed 'Man and Mutt climb Everest', please go here
It'll take three weeks in all as I have arthritis in both knees so I'll likely need some rest days
We'll use a few campsites along the way, do some wild camping and hopefully a night on the sofa halfway around
I know Bron will be in my thoughts the whole time
A full inquest into Bronwen's death is set to take place between May 23 and 25 and the family are making a complaint against Cardiff and Vale University Health Board for failures in her care
A spokeswoman for the health board said: Our thoughts are with the family and friends of Bronwen at this incredibly sad time
An investigation report has been shared with the family and we reiterate the offer for a further meeting to discuss the findings

Abbie Merrett, 33, and husband David, 37, had plans to make a £18,000 ground-floor extension, which would feature a sensory room for their severely disabled three-year-old Rory A couple have told how they have been left £7,000 out of pocket after a builder failed to deliver a sensory room for their autistic son
Abbie Merrett, 33, and husband David, 37, had plans to make a £18,000 ground-floor extension, which would feature a sensory room for their severely disabled three-year-old Rory
The sensory room would have provided Rory with vital specialist sleeping and caring facilities at their home
But they have now had to scrap their plans after a builder failed to show
The couple handed over the deposit last July but they said all they received was excuses for the work not even being started
Have you had a bad experience with builders? Email webnews@mirror. co
uk Abbie claims the trader told her he couldn't work because his van had broken down
He then allegedly proceeded to blame fuel shortages, having to attend a funeral and even heavy rain
The 33-year-old decided to take action in October and emails allegedly show that the builder promised to return her cash that day — but then said he could not as he had phone trouble
Four months on, she has still not received the money but has had to pay back the loan she had taken with family
She told The Sun : It’s been a nightmare, just so upsetting
She added that Rory had been struggling without a sensory room for this long and that it has left daughter Rozalyn, six, unable to sleep because her brother is crying or upset
A spokesperson from Nottinghamshire Police said: We are investigating a reported fraud offence and have been liaising with the person affected to gather the necessary evidence
When approached for comment, the unnamed builder reportedly said he did have the money ready to pay Abbie and that all she needed to do was to reply to his email

David Hunter is charged with murdering his wife of 52 years Janice in December, but insists it was her wish to die
Now, he has told his daughter he wants to kill himself Retired coal miner David Hunter told his daughter he would kill himself at the first opportunity after failing in a suicide pact with his terminally ill wife in Cyprus
David, 74, is charged with murdering his wife of 52 years Janice in December, but insists it was her wish to die
He is alleged to have suffocated leukaemia-stricken Janice before taking an overdose of prescription pills, however he was found and survived
Daughter Lesley Cawthorne, 49, who is supporting her dad, has revealed his agony as he faces a life sentence unless the charge is reduced to assisted dying
Speaking to her from jail in Cypriot capital Nicosia, he told her last week: I do not know how to live without her
I’m Janice’s husband, and without her, I don’t really know who I am
David, a miner for 40 years in his native Northumberland before the pair moved to retire in Cyprus, says he acted out of love for 75-year-old Janice
Janice had begged David for him to end her pain, Lesley says
When Lesley first spoke to him after events in December – in a tearful call as he lay in a Paphos hospital – he told her: I’m so sorry, I love you, but I want to be with your mum
I’m so sorry but as soon as I get a chance, I will kill myself
Lesley begged him not to, saying she could not lose them both
There are people out there doing bad things, she says
All my dad did was love someone
Janice was diagnosed with blood cancer in 2016, and both she and David had endured heartbreak in the late 1980s that influenced their decision more than 30 years later, Lesley said
Janice’s sister Kath died of leukaemia and Janice had vowed not to endure the same pain should she face a similar fate
While David’s mum Rachel died of ovarian cancer, and Lesley recalls how Rachel had asked her son: Just make it stop David, I’m so tired
Lesley told the Mirror how her dad talks to mum every night from his cell, which he shares with nine other men
He dreams of his wife’s screams of pain as her blood cancer took hold
He adored her, a tearful Lesley tells us
The only thing he really cared about was giving his family a nice life
Now it’s ended like this there’s a real possibility he will die alone in a foreign prison
I cannot bear the thought of anyone thinking badly of my dad, because my dad really is the loveliest of men
Lesley calls David every day and every time she is relieved to hear his voice
Lesley, a compliance consultant, said
He’s sad and very lonely
In his better moments, David tells how he longs to be back in Ashington, Northumberland, and to walk along the beach
He talks about mum all the time
He tries to remember the good times and looks back on family holidays
Janice’s side of the family fully supports David, Lesley said
They just want him home – they love him
Mum begged him for a long time (to assist her death) and was very clear about what she wanted
She was very much of the opinion that we have autonomy over our bodies
David had told Lesley that Janice asked him to help her to die but she says: My dad was very good at reassuring me
They never really let on how bad she was
She says her parents suffered with Covid lockdowns, which she claims made it harder to get medical support
David will face a life sentence in Cyprus for a murder charge, while assisted suicide carries a maximum sentence of 10 years
He pleaded not guilty to murder in a February court hearing in Cyprus
Lesley is raising funds for legal fees via the Crowd Justice website with the total at £14,000 so far
But time is running out, as David’s trial in Paphos begins on April 18
Michael Polak, of UK-based Justice Abroad, is representing David
The group has written to the island’s attorney general to ask for the charge to be downgraded
We will be doing everything we can to get David home, he said
It is in the public interest that he does not spend the rest of his life in prison
Nobody I’ve spoken to in Cyprus believes David Hunter should be on trial for murder
Police turned up at Lesley’s door in Norwich on December 18 to explain the situation in Cyprus
David had called his brother after taking an overdose and asked him to look after Lesley
His brother contacted UK police, who contacted Interpol and David was soon found
It is unclear if a note was left as items taken from the home have not yet been given to the defence
The next day David explained to Lesley that her mum had been in constant agony, and felt she had lost all her dignity – she had continual diarrhoea, was suffering horrific nosebleeds and her sight was going
She was unable to eat, drink or sleep, despite being exhausted
Lesley said David was unable to get her upstairs so they lay in reclining chairs downstairs, holding hands
Lesley, who has a pathological fear of flying, was unable to attend the funeral in Cyprus but helped to organise it
Janice would have turned 76 on March 30, and the day after marked the 57th anniversary of when they first met in a pub in Ashington

She came over and said: ‘You can buy me a drink if you want’
He bought her a Bacardi and Coke, and that was it.  They adored each other

Get email updates with the day's biggest stories David Hunter is charged with murdering his wife of 52 years Janice in December, but insists it was her wish to die
Now, he has told his daughter he wants to kill himself Retired coal miner David Hunter told his daughter he would kill himself at the first opportunity after failing in a suicide pact with his terminally ill wife in Cyprus
David, 74, is charged with murdering his wife of 52 years Janice in December, but insists it was her wish to die
He is alleged to have suffocated leukaemia-stricken Janice before taking an overdose of prescription pills, however he was found and survived
Daughter Lesley Cawthorne, 49, who is supporting her dad, has revealed his agony as he faces a life sentence unless the charge is reduced to assisted dying
Speaking to her from jail in Cypriot capital Nicosia, he told her last week: I do not know how to live without her
I’m Janice’s husband, and without her, I don’t really know who I am
David, a miner for 40 years in his native Northumberland before the pair moved to retire in Cyprus, says he acted out of love for 75-year-old Janice
Janice had begged David for him to end her pain, Lesley says
When Lesley first spoke to him after events in December – in a tearful call as he lay in a Paphos hospital – he told her: I’m so sorry, I love you, but I want to be with your mum
I’m so sorry but as soon as I get a chance, I will kill myself
Lesley begged him not to, saying she could not lose them both
There are people out there doing bad things, she says
All my dad did was love someone
Janice was diagnosed with blood cancer in 2016, and both she and David had endured heartbreak in the late 1980s that influenced their decision more than 30 years later, Lesley said
Janice’s sister Kath died of leukaemia and Janice had vowed not to endure the same pain should she face a similar fate
While David’s mum Rachel died of ovarian cancer, and Lesley recalls how Rachel had asked her son: Just make it stop David, I’m so tired
Lesley told the Mirror how her dad talks to mum every night from his cell, which he shares with nine other men
He dreams of his wife’s screams of pain as her blood cancer took hold
He adored her, a tearful Lesley tells us
The only thing he really cared about was giving his family a nice life
Now it’s ended like this there’s a real possibility he will die alone in a foreign prison
I cannot bear the thought of anyone thinking badly of my dad, because my dad really is the loveliest of men
Lesley calls David every day and every time she is relieved to hear his voice
Lesley, a compliance consultant, said
He’s sad and very lonely
In his better moments, David tells how he longs to be back in Ashington, Northumberland, and to walk along the beach
He talks about mum all the time
He tries to remember the good times and looks back on family holidays
Janice’s side of the family fully supports David, Lesley said
They just want him home – they love him
Mum begged him for a long time (to assist her death) and was very clear about what she wanted
She was very much of the opinion that we have autonomy over our bodies
David had told Lesley that Janice asked him to help her to die but she says: My dad was very good at reassuring me
They never really let on how bad she was
She says her parents suffered with Covid lockdowns, which she claims made it harder to get medical support
David will face a life sentence in Cyprus for a murder charge, while assisted suicide carries a maximum sentence of 10 years
He pleaded not guilty to murder in a February court hearing in Cyprus
Lesley is raising funds for legal fees via the Crowd Justice website with the total at £14,000 so far
But time is running out, as David’s trial in Paphos begins on April 18
Michael Polak, of UK-based Justice Abroad, is representing David
The group has written to the island’s attorney general to ask for the charge to be downgraded
We will be doing everything we can to get David home, he said
It is in the public interest that he does not spend the rest of his life in prison
Nobody I’ve spoken to in Cyprus believes David Hunter should be on trial for murder
Police turned up at Lesley’s door in Norwich on December 18 to explain the situation in Cyprus
David had called his brother after taking an overdose and asked him to look after Lesley
His brother contacted UK police, who contacted Interpol and David was soon found
It is unclear if a note was left as items taken from the home have not yet been given to the defence
The next day David explained to Lesley that her mum had been in constant agony, and felt she had lost all her dignity – she had continual diarrhoea, was suffering horrific nosebleeds and her sight was going
She was unable to eat, drink or sleep, despite being exhausted
Lesley said David was unable to get her upstairs so they lay in reclining chairs downstairs, holding hands
Lesley, who has a pathological fear of flying, was unable to attend the funeral in Cyprus but helped to organise it

Rebecca Macdonald said her son was petrified of going to the toilet after the family's bathroom underwent renovations to fix a leak now has a slug infestation A mum has told how her five-year-old son is refusing to go to the toilet as her bathroom is infested with massive slugs
Mum-of-two Rebecca Macdonald, from Glasgow, has said her autistic son, Alexander, is living in fear of his own home because of a major slug issue
The family's bathroom underwent renovations to fix a leak but now has an infestation of slugs, the Daily Record reported
The home is managed by Queen's Cross Housing Association, which says it is working to fix the issue after being notified in March
Rebecca, who is a full-time carer to Alexander, said her son was petrified of the slugs and had begun bedwetting because he didn't want to go in the bathroom
The 25-year-old said: He is now at a stage where he is wetting himself at night-time because he doesn't go into the bathroom
Its really hard to see him kind of going back like that because of the house
It's really hard for him as he hates all creatures and stuff like that
So, getting up during the night to go to the toilet and finds slugs in the bathroom, he point-blank refuses to use the toilet
I'm having to pick them up and put them down the toilet pan or move them so my wee boy can go into the toilet
I'm also waking up during the night and the first time I went in I stepped on one, it was horrible
Rebecca said the issue began in January 2021 and she had spoken to her GP because of the stress caused
Shortly after the works, Rebecca started seeing slugs crawling all over her bathroom fixtures and floor
She said the housing association recently visited the property, after which more leaks were fixed and any holes sealed
However, after claiming to see another 10-12 slugs at the weekend, she called her GP
Rebecca said: I just spoke to my doctor about this as well because it's stressing me out, constantly having to argue with my housing association and not getting anywhere with them
My wee girl is only two, so she's at a stage where she wants to pick them up and I have to keep an eye on her
They are massive as well
I'm sending pictures and videos to the housing association
They told me to put salt down in my bathroom, which I've done and it has done nothing to keep them at bay
Jim Williams, maintenance manager at Queen's Cross Housing Association, said: We first knew about this problem in the property at the end of March and carried out an inspection that week
At that point we couldn't see signs of slugs
When Ms Macdonald reported the problem to us again this month, we arranged another inspection to try to identify the cause of the problem
This is an unusual situation but we are currently working with Ms Macdonald to try and resolve this issue to everyone's satisfaction

Silvija Snipkute, 31, who was a mum-of-one and had five siblings, was described as the strongest person but tragically took her own life after she booked into a hotel room in London A loving young mum was found dead in her hotel room after staff noticed she hadn’t checked out
Silvija Snipkute was discovered dead by cleaning staff at the Bank Hotel in Barking, after she failed to check out that morning
An inquest heard how she tragically took her own life
After they noticed the 31-year-old’s door was locked, staff retrieved a key - but sadlt they found the young mum dead inside, around 11:30am on February 15, My London reported
Medics from the London Ambulance Service declared her dead at the scene
Met Police officers also attended the scene and were informed she had arrived the previous evening and was due to leave that morning
However, the mum had been reported missing when her partner Tomas notified police that she had failed to return home
An inquest heard how the mum had taken herself to a private space where she wouldn’t be interrupted to take her own life
An examination of CCTV showed that nobody else had entered her hotel room since she arrived at 9:49pm and her death was deemed non-suspicious
An inquest at Waltham Forest Coroners Court on June 6 heard that shortly after Silvija was discovered, officers were made aware that the woman in the room was identical to a woman who had been reported missing
A very sad note was found in her hotel room which Coroner Graeme Irvine said was a note of intent indicating that she had intended to take her own life
What is happening where you live? Find out by adding your postcode
A post-mortem examination found that Silvija, a warehouse operative from Dagenham, had no natural diseases, whilst a toxicology report found traces of alcohol and cocaine in her blood and urine
Mr Irvine said: It seems clear to me that Silvija did something that caused her own death, which was tying a ligature around her neck and hanging herself
It also appears to me that Silvija had taken herself to a place where she wouldn’t be interrupted, that would be private
There’s no indication from her actions that she was hoping someone would interrupt her or save her
I don’t think this was a cry for help
He continued: There is sufficient evidence to formulate a conclusion of suicide in this inquest
In a heartbreaking tribute to the mum, her sister-in-law Gabriella called her the strongest person she had known who was always helping others
She said: She was the eldest of five children
Silvija had a simple childhood although had several depression episodes as a teenager, nonetheless she continued to live and work in Lithuania
She moved to the UK several years ago
Living in London, she met her partner Tomas and her daughter was born from this union
Silvija always loved working and she was always helping others
She was a kind, loving mother, sister and friend
She was the strongest person we all ever knew but she heartbreakingly lost her battle with depression
Silvija will be forever remembered and loved by her mother, her siblings, her partner, her daughter and her friends
A GoFundMe to raise money for her family succeeded in raising over £3,000 after she died

Violent Daniel Boulton is on trial accused of murdering former girlfriend Bethany Vincent and her nine-year-old autistic son, Darren Henson, before leading Lincolnshire Police on a 24-hour manhunt A violent ex-partner brutally stabbed a mum and her young autistic son to death before leading police on a 24-hour manhunt, a court has heard
Daniel Boulton is alleged to have knifed his former girlfriend Bethany Vincent and her nine-year-old son Darren Henson, also known as DJ, numerous times while the subject of a restraining order on May 31 last year
Boulton developed a hatred for Darren before the killings, Lincoln Crown Court was told
A nine-month-old child was seen crawling around the house when emergency services arrived at the property in High Holme Road in Louth, Lincolnshire, the court heard, with the defendant later leaving a note saying: I, Daniel Boulton, take full responsibility for 182
The relationship between Boulton and Ms Vincent had deteriorated by the end of March 2019 and he was eventually ordered not to contact his ex-partner, jurors were told
Boulton led Lincolnshire Police on a manhunt until the following day, when he allegedly stabbed an off-duty police officer in the leg in the Hubbards Hills area of Louth before being arrested on a nearby farm
Prosecutors said there was no dispute Boulton stabbed both victims, with him denying the alleged offences because his ability to exercise self-control had been impaired
Opening the case against Boulton on Thursday, prosecutor Katherine Goddard QC said: At around 8pm on the evening of May 31 last year, a young woman and her nine-year-old son were brutally stabbed to death in their own home in Louth
There is no dispute that the person who stabbed both victims was this defendant, Daniel Boulton
Mr Boulton's case will be that, although he physically carried out the stabbings of the two victims, he was, at the time, suffering from a recognised mental condition which substantially impaired his ability to form a rational judgement and exercise self-control
Addressing the history between Boulton and Ms Vincent, Ms Goddard said: The relationship between Bethany and the defendant began in about March 2019 and, like most relationships, at the start everything was good.  Everybody appeared happy
But, by the end of that year, it had deteriorated and was marked by, the prosecution say, increasing violence from Mr Boulton towards Bethany and, later, towards her parents
Bethany made a complaint to the police about Mr Boulton and the violence and behaviour towards her, and Mr Boulton was made the subject of a restraining order precluding him from contacting her
A further restraining order was made after yet another incident in February 2021 but, despite both those orders, Mr Boulton continued to contact Bethany - by telephone, by text message, by social media messages, and by unannounced and uninvited visits to her home
None of that contact was sought by Bethany and, in fact, only a few days after her and DJ were stabbed to death, they were due to move to a new house - to an address unknown to Mr Boulton
Ms Goddard continued: Social services became involved with Bethany and her family after her first complaint to the police of domestic violence in November 2020
Their concerns related only to the risk Mr Boulton presented to the family
He had, by then, expressed a hatred of DJ, a nine-year-old boy. .
who had been diagnosed with autism
He was seen running from an alleyway leading to the back of number 182
He seemed flushed, agitated, and called out to the witnesses to call an ambulance as someone had been stabbed inside
He then casually walked away, not waiting for the emergency services to arrive
Explaining what emergency services saw when they entered the house, Ms Goddard said: In the downstairs front room, they found Bethany lying on her side, half curled into a ball, clearly already dead
Upstairs, they found DJ, lying on his side alongside his bed, also clearly dead
Both appeared to have been stabbed numerous times and, in addition to obvious stab wounds, they had marks consistent with blunt force trauma - being hit by something
Ms Goddard said a nine-month-old child had also been found at the property, untouched and unharmed but clearly distressed and crawling through the house
After allegedly making his escape, Boulton was said to have broken into a bungalow
The following day he ran into a police officer who he allegedly stabbed in the leg after a short confrontation
He tried to flee but police flooded the area after the stabbed cop called them in
Boulton, of Alexandra Road, Skegness, denies murdering Ms Vincent and her son, assault with intent to resist arrest, and burglary.  The trial continues

Tamekia Thompson, 37, says she is desperate to move from her south London home, as her landlord claims he served her with an eviction notice for failing to pay rent for about seven months A single mum who claims to be living in a rodent-infested house says she lives in fear of her four-year-old autistic son eating mouse poo
Tamekia Thompson, 37, says she is desperate to move from her south London home
The mum-of-two claims rodents eat her food, and the floors and cupboards are strewn with thousands of droppings
Tamekia, a private tenant who moved into the property in 2016 with her two young children, said the house became infested with mice two years ago, MyLondon reports
She said her seven-year-old daughter is incredibly stressed and she is terrified her four-year-old autistic son who will eat anything will ingest the droppings and get sick
Tamekia's landlord claims he has put in measures to address the infestation
Christian Mantey told MyLondon he has a contract with a pest control company, who have laid traps in the house and have agreed to visit every two weeks to dispose of dead mice and fill in holes
He added that the process is taking longer than usual because pest control cannot put poison down over safety concerns with Tamekia's son
He also explained that the tenant is aware of this
Mr Mantey said he has now issued a Section 8 eviction notice to Tamekia, who has not paid her rent for around seven months
He said: I've given [Tamekia] her Section 8 notice telling her to leave because she's in arrears of £3,600
In terms of the rodent issue in the house, there's been pest control that has come to the property, I think about a month ago while she was there
They set up all the traps and all the other equipment they needed in front of her
She said they can't put certain traps around because of the kids, so they adjusted the traps according to how she wanted it
They come every two weeks, I've got a contract with them that they will come every two or three weeks to pick up the dead mice or whatever they find, and to fill up the holes
He added: I'm doing what I've got to do, the pest control is doing what they've got to do, you can't eradicate these things straight away
Tamekia claims she is withholding the rent due to problems with the house, including the rodent infestation
She said that she left her job in August to care for her son full time and is now dependent on Universal Credit from Croydon Council to pay her rent, which she says she hasn't paid due to the mouse infestation
Tamekia says she was told by a pest control worker that, because of the severity of the infection, it would be tricky to get rid of them
Tamekia also said the house also has severe issues with damp on one of the walls
However, Mr Mantey claims Tamekia has never told him that her failure to pay rent is due to her problems with the house, or the mouse infestation
Mr Mantey also claims he has had someone fix the damp in the house two years ago and Tamekia didn't complain again until two weeks ago
He said he has recently been contacted by Croydon Council about the house, who he said have given him 60 days to get 'specific' jobs done in the house, including fixing the damp and repairing the windows
He said: There are people coming to do the whole property.  I'm sorting it
Speaking about the mouse infestation, he added: Getting rid of any infestation takes whatever it's going to take
Tamekia, who is currently on a housing waiting list with Croydon Council, moved into the house to support her sister, who had access to the property under the Shared Lives scheme through the council
The former care worker said: My kids are scared, screaming, crying, they don't want to sleep in the room
My daughter said to me 'mummy I'm stressed'. .
and it really broke my heart
I can tell she's frustrated
She said: [My son] will eat anything, you have to be watching him
Tamekia said her family gets sick a lot: My kids they are vomiting and stuff like that. .
every minute we are catching colds. .
it's just hard work for me to be cleaning [mouse] poo every day. .
The council confirmed Tamekia is on a housing waiting list but have advised her to seek alternative accommodation due to a housing shortage
Steve Reed, MP for Croydon North, also raised the issue with the council in September, but contacted Tamekia on November 22 to say he was yet to receive a response
A Croydon Council spokesperson told MyLondon that they have advised Tamekia on her current private arrangement with her landlord
They say they have advised her to seek alternative accommodation through the private rented or social housing sector, as there is a housing shortage
A council spokesperson said: Although this is not a council property, we have provided Ms Thompson with advice and support around her housing options in both the private rented sector and social housing
We have also been in contact with her landlord about repairs to his property

He added: I'm doing what I've got to do, the pest control is doing what they've got to do, you can't eradicate these things straight away
Tamekia claims she is withholding the rent due to problems with the house, including the rodent infestation
She said that she left her job in August to care for her son full time and is now dependent on Universal Credit from Croydon Council to pay her rent, which she says she hasn't paid due to the mouse infestation
Tamekia says she was told by a pest control worker that, because of the severity of the infection, it would be tricky to get rid of them
Tamekia also said the house also has severe issues with damp on one of the walls
However, Mr Mantey claims Tamekia has never told him that her failure to pay rent is due to her problems with the house, or the mouse infestation
Mr Mantey also claims he has had someone fix the damp in the house two years ago and Tamekia didn't complain again until two weeks ago
He said he has recently been contacted by Croydon Council about the house, who he said have given him 60 days to get 'specific' jobs done in the house, including fixing the damp and repairing the windows
He said: There are people coming to do the whole property.  I'm sorting it
Speaking about the mouse infestation, he added: Getting rid of any infestation takes whatever it's going to take
Tamekia, who is currently on a housing waiting list with Croydon Council, moved into the house to support her sister, who had access to the property under the Shared Lives scheme through the council
The former care worker said: My kids are scared, screaming, crying, they don't want to sleep in the room
My daughter said to me 'mummy I'm stressed'. .
and it really broke my heart
I can tell she's frustrated
She said: [My son] will eat anything, you have to be watching him
Tamekia said her family gets sick a lot: My kids they are vomiting and stuff like that. .
every minute we are catching colds. .
it's just hard work for me to be cleaning [mouse] poo every day. .
The council confirmed Tamekia is on a housing waiting list but have advised her to seek alternative accommodation due to a housing shortage
Steve Reed, MP for Croydon North, also raised the issue with the council in September, but contacted Tamekia on November 22 to say he was yet to receive a response
A Croydon Council spokesperson told MyLondon that they have advised Tamekia on her current private arrangement with her landlord
They say they have advised her to seek alternative accommodation through the private rented or social housing sector, as there is a housing shortage
A council spokesperson said: Although this is not a council property, we have provided Ms Thompson with advice and support around her housing options in both the private rented sector and social housing
We have also been in contact with her landlord about repairs to his property

Jade Wilcott's family, from Plymouth, are campaigning for more awareness around mental health and say the mum was failed after losing her best friend and asking for help A heartbroken mum decided to end her own life after the sudden death of her best friend
Jade Wilcott's family told how defeated she must have felt to leave behind her daughter and most previous possession in life
She died overnight after a heart-to-heart with her granddad during which she had appeared to calm down, reports Plymouth Live
The 24-year-old struggled with her mental health which took a turn for the worst during lockdown after her friend and grandparents had to shield, and she felt extremely isolated
Despite her pleas for help, the young mum was failed, according to relatives who believe her death sends a clear message about the urgent need for mental health treatment
Jade was described as an intelligent, lovable and hardworking woman by family during her inquest at Plymouth Coroner's Court on Monday
Relatives said in a statement: Jade Elizabeth Wilcott was a beautiful, caring and thoughtful woman and mother
She was deeply loved by everyone who knew her
She struggled tremendously with her mental health from a young age and despite many times asking for help, she was failed
To take her own life, all must understand how defeated she must have felt leaving behind her most precious possession in life, her daughter Neveah
She will forever be missed
Jade's father told how his daughter had begged for help, which she should have received that same day
She messaged me that night and was saying that she needed help, he recalled
We ended up paying for private counselling because of the wait

The other thing that was affecting her was the Covid lockdown
Her grandparents had to shield and her friend
She felt very, very, very isolated
And then the sudden death of her friend, all these things drove her to it
Jade, of Southway in Plymouth, took her own life in June last year and her family are now raising awareness following their devastating loss
Our message is that mental health treatment needs to be there for people, her dad added
Senior coroner Ian Arrow noted evidence gathered from a number of witnesses, including Jade's GP
In his report, he highlighted how Jade had a history of depression and that her last attendance at the surgery in January 2021 saw her state she was feeling anxious all the time

She was prescribed medication to tackle her depression and help her sleep
A report from Livewell Southwest noted it received a referral to their Liaison Psychiatry team on May 14, weeks before Jade's death
One mental health nurse noted that Jade had admitted to taking a quantity of pills after recently suffering a bereavement
But a risk assessment considered her to be a low risk of self harm and that she did not wish to end her life
The mum had told medical staff that she had acted on impulse
Her grandfather Robert Wilcott said in a statement how Jade and her sister regularly visited and stayed at his home

May 30 was one such occasion, when she stayed over after a night out with friends for a birthday party
Upon returning, she joined her granddad in the summer house and Robert recalled her clearly feeling down and despondent at one point saying she had had enough
The pair continued to talk about how she was feeling and Jade eventually appeared to calm down
The inquest heard how Jade told Robert she was going for a cigarette before he fell asleep
Robert's wife found her unresponsive the following morning and Robert made attempts to revive her
Paramedics and police were also called but Jade sadly died during the night

Toxicologists confirmed Jade had taken a combination of alcohol and a 'non-toxic' level of cocaine while a post mortem gave the cause of death as ligature compression of the neck
Robert told in his statement how her death was a terrible loss to her family and described her as a fantastic girl and an amazing mother to her daughter
Civilian investigator Phil Trevains told the inquest it was clear Jade had been upset following the death of her mother a few years previously, compounded with the death of a close friend just a few weeks before her suicide
He said medical reports showed she had struggled with her mental health and noted that counselling suggestions offered to Jade had come a little too late
The expert further highlighted the difficulties of accessing counselling during the coronavirus lockdown
Mr Arrow concluded that Jade had sadly taken her own life and expressed his profound condolences to her family of which many attended the inquest
He said: She was clearly a young lady who had a lot to offer friends, family and society

Matt Lloyd, 54, spent six weeks in ICU and on a burns unit at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, undergoing total of four operations following the self-harming incident last August A dad suffered 70% full body burns as a result of self-harming
Matt Lloyd had suffered a breakdown in a 12-year relationship at the time of the incident - and has thanked hospital staff for saving his life
The 54-year-old was rushed to Glasgow Royal Infirmary last August before spending six weeks in intensive care and then being transferred to the burns unit
He underwent a total of four operations, reports the Daily Record
The first thing he remembers on waking up was asking to speak to his two sons, and admits he feels guilty about what he put them through
Speaking about the heroic medical staff who treated him, Matt said: I really believe that without their help, I wouldn’t be here
They saved me and gave me back to my sons
With 60-70 per cent full-body burns, doctors operated quickly to save Matt’s life and prevent further damage to his muscles
He told his sons and the rest of the family he was in a desperate place prior to the incident
He said: I felt so guilty about what I had put them (his sons) through and explained to them and my family that I didn’t do it because I didn’t love them
I just didn’t love myself at that time
During his time on the burns unit Matt was looked after by physiotherapists, occupational therapists and healthcare support workers, as well as mental health teams who address the impacts of the trauma

Catriona Murray, a senior physiotherapist on the unit, said: A burn injury is often a life-changing injury, not just for the patient, but for their family too
We come together as a team, to help encourage functional tasks, our goal is to help get people back to functioning as they were before their injury
Thanking the nursing team, Matt said: I really believe that without their help, I wouldn’t be here

David Hunter is charged with murdering his wife of 52 years Janice in December, but insists it was her wish to die
Now, he has told his daughter he wants to kill himself Retired coal miner David Hunter told his daughter he would kill himself at the first opportunity after failing in a suicide pact with his terminally ill wife in Cyprus
David, 74, is charged with murdering his wife of 52 years Janice in December, but insists it was her wish to die
He is alleged to have suffocated leukaemia-stricken Janice before taking an overdose of prescription pills, however he was found and survived
Daughter Lesley Cawthorne, 49, who is supporting her dad, has revealed his agony as he faces a life sentence unless the charge is reduced to assisted dying
Speaking to her from jail in Cypriot capital Nicosia, he told her last week: I do not know how to live without her
I’m Janice’s husband, and without her, I don’t really know who I am
David, a miner for 40 years in his native Northumberland before the pair moved to retire in Cyprus, says he acted out of love for 75-year-old Janice
Janice had begged David for him to end her pain, Lesley says
When Lesley first spoke to him after events in December – in a tearful call as he lay in a Paphos hospital – he told her: I’m so sorry, I love you, but I want to be with your mum
I’m so sorry but as soon as I get a chance, I will kill myself
Lesley begged him not to, saying she could not lose them both
There are people out there doing bad things, she says
All my dad did was love someone
Janice was diagnosed with blood cancer in 2016, and both she and David had endured heartbreak in the late 1980s that influenced their decision more than 30 years later, Lesley said
Janice’s sister Kath died of leukaemia and Janice had vowed not to endure the same pain should she face a similar fate
While David’s mum Rachel died of ovarian cancer, and Lesley recalls how Rachel had asked her son: Just make it stop David, I’m so tired
Lesley told the Mirror how her dad talks to mum every night from his cell, which he shares with nine other men
He dreams of his wife’s screams of pain as her blood cancer took hold
He adored her, a tearful Lesley tells us
The only thing he really cared about was giving his family a nice life
Now it’s ended like this there’s a real possibility he will die alone in a foreign prison
I cannot bear the thought of anyone thinking badly of my dad, because my dad really is the loveliest of men
Lesley calls David every day and every time she is relieved to hear his voice
Lesley, a compliance consultant, said
He’s sad and very lonely
In his better moments, David tells how he longs to be back in Ashington, Northumberland, and to walk along the beach
He talks about mum all the time
He tries to remember the good times and looks back on family holidays
Janice’s side of the family fully supports David, Lesley said
They just want him home – they love him
Mum begged him for a long time (to assist her death) and was very clear about what she wanted
She was very much of the opinion that we have autonomy over our bodies
David had told Lesley that Janice asked him to help her to die but she says: My dad was very good at reassuring me
They never really let on how bad she was
She says her parents suffered with Covid lockdowns, which she claims made it harder to get medical support
David will face a life sentence in Cyprus for a murder charge, while assisted suicide carries a maximum sentence of 10 years
He pleaded not guilty to murder in a February court hearing in Cyprus
Lesley is raising funds for legal fees via the Crowd Justice website with the total at £14,000 so far
But time is running out, as David’s trial in Paphos begins on April 18
Michael Polak, of UK-based Justice Abroad, is representing David
The group has written to the island’s attorney general to ask for the charge to be downgraded
We will be doing everything we can to get David home, he said
It is in the public interest that he does not spend the rest of his life in prison
Nobody I’ve spoken to in Cyprus believes David Hunter should be on trial for murder
Police turned up at Lesley’s door in Norwich on December 18 to explain the situation in Cyprus
David had called his brother after taking an overdose and asked him to look after Lesley
His brother contacted UK police, who contacted Interpol and David was soon found
It is unclear if a note was left as items taken from the home have not yet been given to the defence
The next day David explained to Lesley that her mum had been in constant agony, and felt she had lost all her dignity – she had continual diarrhoea, was suffering horrific nosebleeds and her sight was going
She was unable to eat, drink or sleep, despite being exhausted
Lesley said David was unable to get her upstairs so they lay in reclining chairs downstairs, holding hands
Lesley, who has a pathological fear of flying, was unable to attend the funeral in Cyprus but helped to organise it
Janice would have turned 76 on March 30, and the day after marked the 57th anniversary of when they first met in a pub in Ashington
He thought she was the most beautiful girl in the town, Lesley recalls
She came over and said: ‘You can buy me a drink if you want’
He bought her a Bacardi and Coke, and that was it.  They adored each other

Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition with potentially 'devastating' consequences - but families affected have felt largely 'unsupported' Health watchdog NICE has revealed a landmark initiative today to vastly improve the care of those exposed to alcohol in the womb
Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) affects around 3% of the UK population - three times as many as autism - yet more than half of Brits (53%) have never heard of the condition
FASD is a neurodevelopmental condition that arises from alcohol exposure in the womb, with 428 associated conditions linked to devastating consequences - from brain damage to physical and developmental issues
Today, The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) said that any child thought to have been exposed should be given an assessment
Any child confirmed to have been exposed should be sent for a neurodevelopmental assessment, and those confirmed to have FASD should be given a management plan for their needs
It also said women should be given early advice not to drink in their pregnancy, and have their alcohol consumption noted on records
This is part of a 20-year fight by campaigners and families living with FASD, who feel they have been largely unsupported
The spokeswoman for National Organisation for FASD, Joanna Buckard, said: The NICE Quality Standard is a major leap forward in the fight to reduce alcohol-exposed pregnancies by giving women the information and support they need and, vitally, to create brighter futures for those with FASD and their families
Too many people with FASD up to now have been left undiagnosed and unsupported, with sometimes devastating and avoidable consequences
Professor Raja Mukherjee, who heads the FASD National Specialist Clinic and was on the NICE Quality Standard Committee, said: FASD is a complex condition which affects brain and body
There are over 428 conditions linked to FASD, and it presents in multiple ways
But in terms of recognition, we’re about 20 years behind other conditions like autism or ADHD
I hope it does not take so long going forward to implement the improvements outlined in the NICE Quality Standard, and make the real difference that people with FASD deserve.  Despite 2
4 million people thought to have FASD in the UK, compared to the 1 million people estimated to be living with autism, the majority of Brits (66%) have heard of autism
A third (32%) who knew about FASD didn't know how many people were living with it, while almost half (46%) estimated the figures to be lower than it is
It comes as research, carried out by OnePoll, on behalf of the National Organisation for FASD, found nearly a quarter of adults think it’s okay to have alcohol during pregnancy - which goes against the Chief Medical Officer's advice that it is safest to avoid it

Jan Griffin, from Surrey, whose 20-year-old son Rossi has FASD, opened up about her experience
She said: I didn’t have any issues with alcohol
I was just an ordinary 40-year-old woman living my best life as it were
Had anybody said to me, when I was thinking of having a sleeping tablet or a tot of brandy to de-stress, did you know alcohol kills cells as they migrate in the baby?, I’d have sat up and made different decisions
I wish someone had said - this is what happens, these are the facts, the choice is yours, you’re not being judged
We cannot change the history of FASD, but with this long-awaited NICE Quality Standard we WILL change futures
Rossi said: I’m very forgetful, oftentimes I have trouble socialising and sometimes it’s a comfort issue - I may get back or leg pains
Clare Devanney-Glynn, adoptive mum to three with FASD, who also sat on the NICE Quality Standard Committee, said: Thanks to this, my children and others just like them will be able to enter adulthood being understood by society in a way that just hasn’t ever happened before
This has the capacity to change what our entire society looks like for the better

Autistic Larsson Hankins only drinks water from an Evian bottle and was pulled form Bude Park Primary School when he was tricked into drinking it from a tap as part of a game A furious mum removed her autistic son from school when he said he was forced to drink tap water in a game, despite teachers knowing he only drinks juice or from an Evian bottle
Marie Donnelly says a staff member spotted her son Larsson Hankins, seven, not drinking from the school’s reusable bottle and took him out of class to play a game
She accused them of lying to her son, claiming her son was told he had to have a drink as his mum was concerned which she refutes every saying
Larsson - who only drinks juice or Evian, was presented two cups of water and asked to guess which was from a tap
When he could not determine which was which, Marie alleges Larrson was told they were both tap water, leaving him in tears when he got back to class, Hull Live reported
Maries, 36, from Hull said: As Larsson is autistic, he struggles socially and for him to be alone in a room with a staff member he doesn't know well and to be pressured into having to drink water will have caused him a lot of stress
He told me he cried when he got back to class and he cried again when he got home
School life is already hard for Larsson, so I don't like that they're making things harder for him, especially the way he was spoken to
I'll do whatever I have to do to make him happy and make school less stressful for him
When his dad went into school to complain the family claims he was told autistic kids drink water to which he replied: This one doesn’t
In response to the claims, Bude Park Primary School said: Staff and governors of the school are committed to safeguarding and promoting the health and welfare of its children
This year, the school purchased water bottles for all of its pupils
These bottles are kept in school and ensures all children have access to plenty of safe drinking water throughout the school day
The school prides itself on being inclusive and endeavours to support every child regardless of their level of need
The school has accommodated pupils who have found the transition to water-only more difficult and will continue to work with parents and pupils to ensure that all children are appropriately supported to make healthy choices
Whilst this initiative has been widely supported, the school encourages those parents who have concerns to raise these with the headteacher and/or via the school’s complaints policy

Lorna Hewitt, 43, and her husband Craig, 42, kept Matthew Langley, 22, locked in the attic of their home in Sheffield, South Yorks
for seven months - they were both found guilty of false imprisonment and of causing or allowing a vulnerable adult to suffer serious physical harm The mum of an autistic man who was found close to death weighing six stone and locked in an attic, has been found guilty
Lorna Hewitt, 43, and her husband Craig, 42, kept Matthew Langley, 22, locked in the attic of their home in Sheffield, South Yorks.  for seven months
Matthew was found inside the vomit and faeces-covered room severely dehydrated and weighing just six stone (39kg)
The Hewitts denied keeping him captive but today a jury found them guilty at Sheffield Crown Court
The couple were found guilty of false imprisonment and of causing or allowing a vulnerable adult to suffer serious physical harm
Matthew was found by paramedics seriously underweight, dehydrated and with his life hanging in the balance, the jury was told
Nicholas Campbell QC, prosecuting, previously said the ambulance service was called to the home in the early hours in June 2020
He was rushed to an intensive care unit in a pitiable state with abrasions which indicates that he had been moving around on all fours, the prosecutor told the court
He had suffered damage to a kidney with high sodium levels relating to severe dehydration, it was heard
Mr Campbell added: His sodium levels were dangerously high.  They measured 180
They were so high they could shut down his brain and kill him
Anything above 145, there is a real chance of death
The Home Office pathologist examined the injuries and said the abrasions and bruises were consistent in his view with Matthew having been crawling on all fours over objects in his path

Cops found faeces and vomit in the attic bedroom all over the floor and bedding, a jury was told
The room was filled with buzzing flies, a bad smell and a key on the outside of the door, the court heard
Matthew, who has suffered from irritable bowel syndrome, incontinence, arthritis and learning difficulties, had weighed only six stone (39kg) when he was found, Mr Campbell said
He weighed eight-and-a-half stone (53
6kg) just seven months earlier in November 2019, the court heard
However, Mr Campbell said Matthew made a good physical recovery thanks to the hard work of medical professionals and he was discharged weighing 55kg

Hewitt told police his wife had found Matthew upstairs lying on the floor and he claimed his stepson had been fed and that he ate in his room
He also claimed after police found a key on the outside of Matthew’s bedroom door that there had been locks on the internal doors because their home used to be student accommodation
He also Hewitt stated to police that Matthew had only been locked in at night because he would go downstairs and set off security alarms
Matthew's mum chose to give no comment answers to all questions asked by the police, the court heard
Mr Campbell told the jury: It’s a matter for you that you may think that as the pressures grew they were prepared to gamble with his health in order that he would be taken off their hands and be looked after by others
Matthew's stepdad chose not to give evidence during the trial but his mum told the jury her son stopped having respite stay-overs because he became fed up with going to the care centre
But Mr Campbell claimed if they had not cancelled the respite care stays he received he would never have ended up in hospital fighting for his life
The mum further claimed during the trial that Matthew was not enjoying himself at the care home and that he wanted to go home
She said she had been anxious leaving Matthew alone on a couple of occasions but there were no other times when he was left alone and she tried to make him as safe as she could
Mr Campbell said the couple had started locking Matthew in his room at night but she claimed he had been left downstairs when they went out
The jury found them guilty after deliberating for a day

Manchester United fan Robert Davies, 33, had been partying in Blackpool and joking with family in the days and weeks leading up to his death A photo of a dad-of-two taken weeks before he took his life shows the signs aren't always clear, his family has said
Manchester United fan Robert Davies, 33, had been partying in Blackpool and joking with family in the days and weeks leading up to his death
Now his mum and sisters want others to see the pictures of an outwardly happy young man to raise awareness
Speaking to WalesOnline bereft mother Rachel said her home in Crickhowell feels empty since Robert's death
His family says support was lacking throughout his struggles and that while he received treatment for alcohol addiction they were never given a direct line for a support worker
Rachel says she's also struggled to find bereavement support and has had to resort to Facebook community groups
Robert is described as fun-loving and as mischievous as anything
The only thing the popular window cleaner adored more than football and his team Manchester United were his family and friends
But on November 30 he took his life days after enjoying a holiday in Blackpool and sharing photos of his trip with his girlfriend on social media
At home with her seven cats, three dogs, and 14-year-old daughter, Rachel points to the corner of the room beside her which is now Robert’s corner
His ashes sit in the middle of ornamental robins, candles, and a small glass house which reads: Special son, your light will shine forever inside our broken hearts
Her lounge is crammed with pictures of him - some with his two children aged 10 and four
Robbie is here with me forever, Rachel, 52, said.  I do believe that
They always say when robins appear, loved ones are near
Life is empty here now, that’s how I’d describe it
The only joy I get is when my grandchildren come to stay
How do you carry on doing normal daily things when you feel your life has come to a halt? It’s just day by day, or even minute by minute sometimes
It’s the waking up in the morning when you forget for a second that he’s not here, that’s the worst part, she said
Flicking through countless photos of her son, she continued: I would genuinely say he was one of the happiest and most outgoing people for much of his life
A super-friendly person who would walk into a group of people he wouldn’t know and would come out with many friends
Rachel smiles and laughs as she recalls funny memories which she now cherishes more than ever
At his nan’s birthday party only days before he died he brought out a cake for her with candles that didn’t blow out
He found it hilarious watching her trying everything to get these candles to stop
That sums up the type of person he was
It also shows how anyone can find themselves at their lowest ebb within days and when their family might least expect it, she says
Even in the days prior to his death Robert’s relatives said he had appeared to be as happy as he’d been in a long time, and had even decided to take his girlfriend on holiday
A picture taken of Robert in Blackpool shows him the week before he took his life, and it’s a picture Rachel wants others to see
Looking at the photo, she explained: By that point I think he definitely was suffering mentally and he tried to mask it with drink
He’d often drink a bottle of vodka a day which I’d put water in without him knowing
But he did seem to have become better prior to his death
He did seem to have picked himself up and then he’d have a bad week where he’d be really down
His friends would often say how they felt he was getting there, but maybe he was putting on a show to make people think he was okay
I want others to be aware that there are not always clear signs
The story about his nan not being able to blow the candles out was days before he died
The photos in Blackpool were taken a week before
By the time of his death Robert had worked hard to build his window cleaning business in Brecon and enjoyed speaking with locals - particularly those older than himself
The older folk really loved him, he’d spend half the time having tea and coffee with them, Rachel went on
He came home telling us all about them and the stories he’d heard
He’d often sit with them during the lockdowns to keep them company
It does show it can happen to anyone and that’s the saddest part
People don’t think this will ever happen to them or to anyone they know
A year before he died he’d have been the person in my life I’d have worried about the least
When his mental health dipped in the spring of 2021 Robert moved back in with Rachel, and she says they spent his final months watching copious amounts of sport on the television, sometimes until the early hours of the morning, to occupy his mind
He became my little boy again, she recalled
The night before he died Robert had fallen asleep drunk on the sofa
Rachel rang the doctors the following morning after he had told her he felt he wanted to take his life
She says she still feels guilty that she didn’t call the emergency services, but she feels let down that she wasn’t prepared for that moment
She claims Robert wasn’t offered any support other than for his alcohol dependency, even though he’d sometimes told specialists that he wanted to take his life in the months before he died
I rang the doctors and they said they’d call me back, but by the time they rang me back an hour and a half later Robert was dead, Rachel said
Not only did Robert not get enough support but we as a family didn’t get the support we needed
If we’d had appropriate guidance we’d have known what to do when Robert told us he wanted to take his life
We were in contact with mental health specialists but we were never given a direct number to contact or guidance on what to do in that scenario
There was no face to face support during Covid either
Everything was done over the phone - even the counselling for Robert for his problems with alcohol which he started in the March [of 2021]
He needed face to face help
On the morning of his death Robert told his mum he was planning on driving away from the house when she went to drop off her grandson at school, to which Rachel told him he couldn’t because he had been drinking
When I came back from dropping Jaxson off I was relieved to see Robert’s car still outside, she remembered
I knew he’d gone to his room when I got in the house but that was normal when he was particularly down
Sometimes he would go to bed and sleep the day away
I thought he was safe up there and that there was nothing up there that he could hurt himself with
I was heading up the stairs to tell him I’d rang the doctors when the police knocked on the door and said they were doing a welfare check
Then I was told he’d rang his ex-partner and friend to tell them he wanted to kill himself
They finally got his door open and told me to ring an ambulance
I felt completely numb, but I honestly thought he’d be okay
The paramedics and police worked on him for 40 minutes before telling me he’d gone
It didn’t feel real and still doesn’t feel real
How can you believe that someone who had been so full of life could be gone like that? I still think he’s going to walk through the door
How do you accept that your little boy is gone? Since Robert died Rachel says specialist support has also been few and far between and she's had to seek help on Facebook
She says there are lengthy waiting lists just for an initial phone call and charities are becoming overstretched
Robert’s sister Parisse said: There’s a serious lack of help for anyone these days
We need to encourage everyone, especially men, that there is no shame in speaking about your feelings
Too many young men are struggling in silence, we need to support one another

On the morning of his death Robert told his mum he was planning on driving away from the house when she went to drop off her grandson at school, to which Rachel told him he couldn’t because he had been drinking
When I came back from dropping Jaxson off I was relieved to see Robert’s car still outside, she remembered
I knew he’d gone to his room when I got in the house but that was normal when he was particularly down
Sometimes he would go to bed and sleep the day away
I thought he was safe up there and that there was nothing up there that he could hurt himself with
I was heading up the stairs to tell him I’d rang the doctors when the police knocked on the door and said they were doing a welfare check
Then I was told he’d rang his ex-partner and friend to tell them he wanted to kill himself
They finally got his door open and told me to ring an ambulance
I felt completely numb, but I honestly thought he’d be okay
The paramedics and police worked on him for 40 minutes before telling me he’d gone
It didn’t feel real and still doesn’t feel real
How can you believe that someone who had been so full of life could be gone like that? I still think he’s going to walk through the door
How do you accept that your little boy is gone? Since Robert died Rachel says specialist support has also been few and far between and she's had to seek help on Facebook
She says there are lengthy waiting lists just for an initial phone call and charities are becoming overstretched
Robert’s sister Parisse said: There’s a serious lack of help for anyone these days
We need to encourage everyone, especially men, that there is no shame in speaking about your feelings
Too many young men are struggling in silence, we need to support one another

Benjamin Davis, from Greater Manchester, was given the reference in the context that his autism diagnosis was. .
part of him but not all of him, a court heard A 22-year-old took his own life after being given a gravestone reference during a therapy session, a court heard
Benjamin Davis, also known as Binyomin Chaim Davis, took his own life only a few months after the session, having never got over that experience, his dad said
The young man was found at his home in Prestwich, Greater Manchester, and died at Salford Royal Hospital in November five days later
An inquest was held at Bolton Coroner's Court on Wednesday where private counsellor Avremi Rosenberg admitted that he should have used different wording in his session with Benjamin, who was 21 at the time
He also accepted that the language was inappropriate, reports Manchester Evening News
Mr Davis, Benjamin's dad, told the court that his son had a charming smile and was a special person
Speaking at the inquest, he said: We really miss him
He had a kind nature with a charming smile
He was a great student, he enjoyed photography, walking, and spending time with his family
He was a real pleasure to be with and he’s missed by family and friends
Despite his academic prowess, Benjamin struggled initially to fit in at school but eventually made a close knit group of friends
His challenges at school meant Benjamin was diagnosed with depression and anxiety in 2018, Mr Davis continued
The youngster was also diagnosed with autism in 2021, assistant coroner Rachel Syed heard
After this diagnosis, Benjamin had five counselling sessions with Mr Rosenberg in spring last year
And it was during these sessions in which Mr Rosenberg referenced a gravestone, Mr Davis said
He added: I asked Mr Rosenberg about it and he confirmed he did [say it]
When asked why used the imagery, Mr Rosenberg said he said 'in the context that his autism diagnosis was… part of him but not all of him'
He added: Benjamin approached me because he knew I was a counsellor with experience with working with people on the autism spectrum
In hindsight, this would have been better dealt with by the NHS
I did apologise to Benjamin for the way it came over
It was definitely not said in a blunt way
It was very much in the context that his autism diagnosis was very important and it was part of him but not all of him, and in that context what would be written on his gravestone
In the future whatever I can do to help you to come to terms about what has happened, I would properly arrange it
I express my sincerest, sincerest condolences
When asked by the coroner if his choice of words was inappropriate, Mr Rosenberg replied: Definitely, yes
Ms Syed said at the conclusion of the hearing that she would be writing a letter of concern to Mr Rosenberg’s organisation
She also will be writing letters of concern to Benjamin’s GP surgery Whittaker Lane Medical Centre and Greater Manchester Mental Health Trust (GMMH)
The coroner explained: A formal letter of concern will be written to the GP, GMMH, and the private organisation, highlighting the need to ensure a more collaborative working approach between these organisations and sharing information such as diagnoses of autism
I will also reference the need to have more training on autism as a condition
Earlier in the hearing, Benjamin’s GP in the final months of his life, Dr Rebecca-Ann Sheppard-Hickey, said she could not find a record of a formal autism diagnosis in his notes
Dr Ruth Watson, from GMMH, carried out an internal review of Benjamin’s care, and also admitted mistakes were made with clinical staff now receiving more in-depth training on autism
She said: The main focus is that staff need additional training on autism
It is going to be added to our clinical risk training as an additional focus point
Dr Watson did however add it was difficult to say if Benjamin’s death was preventable from the perspective of mental health services, as his last involvement with the service came around two months before his passing
Recording a verdict of suicide, Ms Syed confirmed that Benjamin’s medical cause of death was hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy
She concluded: I am sadly satisfied to the relevant legal threshold [Benjamin] intended to take his own life
I am therefore in law required to record a verdict of suicide
I hope you can focus on the wonderful memories you have of Benjamin

Nine family members have been found dead after a suspected suicide pact due to financial problems
They have been described as caring and animal loving by locals A 15-year-old girl was among nine members of a caring and animal loving family who have been found dead in what appears to have been a suicide pact over financial debts
The bodies were found in two separate houses that belonged to two brothers from the family in the Sangli district of Maharashtra, India
Only two cats remain alive at one of the homes with the family described as caring and animal loving by locals with a vet, Dr Manik Vanmore, among the dead
Police believe that the nine people died after consuming poison and that the family was going through financial problems, reported Indian Express
Suicide notes refer to repeated and public harassment that the family suffered from money lenders which was both mental and physical, it is reported
The ages of the family range from a girl aged 15, to a 72-year-old woman
The brothers have been named as Popat Yallapa Vanmore, 52, and Dr Manik Yallapa Vanmore, 49
The seven other bodies were identified as Sangeeta Popat Vanmore, 48, Archana Popat Vanmore, 30, Shubham Popat Vanmore, 28, Rekha Manik Vanmore, 45, Aditya Manik Vanmore, 15, Anita Manik Vanmore, 28, and Akkatai Vanmore, 72
Footage taken at the scene shows the corpses lying inside rooms
They were found by locals who noticed the front doors had not been opened for some time
Sangli's District Superintendent of Police Dixit Kumar Gedam said: Nine dead bodies have been recovered in Mhaisal village of Sangli district, out of which three bodies have been recovered from one house and six dead bodies from the other house
The forensic team is present on the spot
A police investigation is currently under way, with officers registering an unnatural cause of death
The bodies will be sent for autopsies
Fifteen people from the region, who have allegedly lent money to the brothers, have been arrested and the police are searching for 10 more suspects, reported Indian Express
A family friend Ashwini Sawant said that they were a caring family
I literally grew up in their home, he said, All of them were very caring and considered me as one of them
From all the special dishes cooked at their home to all the major events, I have been there
Less than a week ago, I came to their house for a paani-puri party
They were a happy family and loved animals
But I also know that over the past few years, they have been under stress because of debt
But we had never imagined this

Lorna Hewitt, 43, and Craig, 42, were each sentenced to six years behind bars after they were found guilty of falsely imprisoning Matthew Langley, 22, at their home in Sheffield, South Yorkshire A mum and stepdad who locked their autistic son in an attic where he was found close to death have been jailed today Lorna Hewitt, 43, and her husband Craig, 42, were each sentenced to six years behind bars after they were found guilty of falsely imprisoning Matthew Langley, 22, at their home in Sheffield, South Yorkshire
Matthew was severely dehydrated and weighed just six stone - or 36 kilos - when he was found inside the vomit and faeces-covered room
Judge Michael Slater, described Lorna Hewitt's actions as a grave abuse of trust between a mother and her son sentencing at Sheffield Crown Court on Friday
He added: You were the primary carer for Matthew with all his difficulties and challenges
It makes it all the more inexplicable to me that for those seven months you failed to provide him with the support and provision of food and drink that he craved and needed
The Hewitts had earlier denied keeping Matthew captive at their home for seven months, but a jury found them both guilty
The couple were also found guilty of causing or allowing a vulnerable adult to suffer serious physical harm
Matthew was found by paramedics seriously underweight, dehydrated and with his life hanging in the balance, the court heard
Nicholas Campbell QC, prosecuting, previously said the ambulance service was called to the home in Sheffield, South Yorks, in the early hours of June 2, 2020
Matthew was rushed to a hospital intensive care unit in a pitiable state with abrasions indicating he had been moving around on all fours, the prosecutor told the court
He had suffered damage to a kidney with high sodium levels relating to severe dehydration, it was heard
Mr Campbell added: His sodium levels were dangerously high.  They measured 180
They were so high they could shut down his brain and kill him
Anything above 145, there is a real chance of death
The Home Office pathologist examined the injuries and said the abrasions and bruises were consistent in his view with Matthew having been crawling on all fours over objects in his path
When police went into the attic they found faeces and vomit all over the floor and the bedding, and it was swarming with buzzing flies, the court heard
Police also found a key on the outside of the door, it was said
Matthew, who has suffered from irritable bowel syndrome, incontinence, arthritis and learning difficulties, had weighed only six stone when he was found, Mr Campbell said
In November 2019, just seven months prior, he had weighed eight-and-a-half stone, the court heard
Seven months earlier, in November 2019, he had weighed eight-and-a-half stone, the court heard
Thanks to the hard of medical professionals, Matthew made a good physical recovery and was discharged from the hospital weights 8. 6 stone
In mitigation, John Harrison, for Lorna Hewitt, read a report from psychologist Rekha Davis that said she was vulnerable to manipulation and exploitation and was easily suggestible
The report stated, he said: Given her emotional vulnerability, Mrs Hewitt's capacity to consider the consequences of her actions and decisions is limited
Miss Tana Adkin QC, representing Mr Craig Hewitt, said there had been a significant change in his understanding of what he had done throughout the court proceedings
She said: He is devastated about what happened to Mathew
He is not a deliberately cruel man in the sense that the courts see and have seen in the past
He is not someone that would punish Matthew for his autism

However, Judge Slater disagreed with these characterisations as he sentenced the pair behind bars
Addressing Craig Hewitt, the judge said: You were complicit equally with wife Lorna Hewitt in care effectively-being switched off to any degree for Matthew as he was locked in his room and starved of food
That did not occur by negligence, it did not occur by recklessness
It was a plan between the pair of you
I'm quite satisfied that nothing in that household occurred without either you knowing about it or approving of it
Speaking directly to Lorna Hewitt, he said: It is argued on your behalf that you were particularly vulnerable and suggestible at the time
I had the benefit of observing you give evidence in the trial over the course of several days
It did not seem to me that you were not capable of standing up for yourself or that you were particularly suggestible
You were both an articulate, temperate and thoughtful witness

Retired police officer and dad-of-three Haydn Morgan said his beloved daughter Bronwen, 26, suffered a devastating injustice in relation to her mental health care while she trained to be a psychiatric nurse at Cardiff University Parents who camped outside their beloved daughter's room to stop her harming herself have shared their heartbreak after she tragically took her own life
Haydn Morgan and his wife Jayne took it in turns to sleep on a camper bed against the door of their 26-year-old daughteer Bronwen's room so she wouldn't escape, self-harm or take her own life
Dad-of-three Haydn said his daughter - who was studying to be a mental health nurse at Cardiff University - didn't like it, but they couldn't let her out of our sight because of the risk she posed to herself
He added: It was the only way we could keep her safe
Haydn - who says his daughter suffered a devastating injustice in her care - said he and his wife fought for Bronwen to be admitted to a psychiatric war but it was always refused
He said: We just didn't know where to turn
It had all been so different just a few years earlier
Growing up Bronwen Morgan was a talented swimmer, played the piano and was a popular Girl Guide
She also loved working with children and had a natural way of connecting with them
Before long she found herself a job in the behavioural unit at her old primary school where she earned the nickname Bomb-proof Bron as she was always calm and in control under pressure
But during her time in Cardiff University, where she was training to become a mental health nurse, her own bouts of anxiety and depression intensified and she developed an eating disorder
Her problems were further exacerbated by the pandemic when the usual activities she needed to manage her mental health disappeared virtually overnight
This coincided with the services of her community psychiatric nurse (CPN) being taken away without warning
Haydn, a dad-of-three, added that Bronwen would frequently be detained by police under the Mental Health Act and sent to Hafan Y Coed, a specialist psychiatric unit on the grounds of University Hospital Llandough
However he claims she would often be discharged from the unit without the family knowing which led to her going missing
Bronwen began to feel helpless and isolated which meant her mental health spiralled out of control and left her in a place that she felt she could not find a way back from, added Haydn, from Cyncoed, Cardiff
After many months of pain and trauma, Bronwen was allegedly told by medical staff that if she were to find herself in a crisis in the future, the police would arrest her
This decision, her family claims, was the final straw
Haydn, a retired police officer, admitted that he has struggled to shake the memory of the last day he saw Bronwen alive
He recalled: That week she was happy, smiling and in a really good place
We hadn't seen her like that for ages
Unbeknown to us she had this plan to take her own life
In a way she was saying goodbye to us, but nobody knew
She had been trying to do it for a long time
We've been told she was probably feeling a sense of elation and a sense of knowing that 'I'm going to take my life and my family will be able to get on with their lives'
Bronwen was found unresponsive at a hotel in Cardiff and died on Thursday, August 27, 2020
As well as writing to Cardiff and Vale University Health Board in a last-ditch cry for help, she penned a letter to her mum, dad and two younger sisters, Tesni and Cerys
She said she wanted us to know that she had the best childhood ever and that we'd done nothing wrong
It was just heartbreaking, added Haydn
We had literally lost all hope
We couldn't find a way of going forward and her mental health team had locked her in this cocoon and insisted that this was the therapy she should be having
Haydn, who is now seeing a therapist himself, added: Now I'm retired, you see photographs of her around the house all the time and it brings it all back
I've been miserable, tired and angry - I think we all have
Her heartbroken family claims that if they had been given more of a say in her care - which would have led to a more tailored and bespoke approach - she could still be alive today
They said Bronwen experienced a devastating injustice in her care and was treated with a blanket approach which had little effect on improving her mental health
Since the tragedy, Bronwen's family have set up Bronwen's Wish, a charity which aims to provide safe spaces for young people experiencing challenges with their mental health
It aims to provide wellbeing pods in primary and secondary schools which will act as quiet, relaxing and safe places for pupils who want to talk about their mental health
In June, Haydn and his dog Celog plan to walk the entire Pembrokeshire coastal path in one go - the equivalent distance to climbing Everest - to raise money for Bronwen's Wish
To donate to the challenge, dubbed 'Man and Mutt climb Everest', please go here
It'll take three weeks in all as I have arthritis in both knees so I'll likely need some rest days
We'll use a few campsites along the way, do some wild camping and hopefully a night on the sofa halfway around
I know Bron will be in my thoughts the whole time
A full inquest into Bronwen's death is set to take place between May 23 and 25 and the family are making a complaint against Cardiff and Vale University Health Board for failures in her care
A spokeswoman for the health board said: Our thoughts are with the family and friends of Bronwen at this incredibly sad time
An investigation report has been shared with the family and we reiterate the offer for a further meeting to discuss the findings

Bronwen was found unresponsive at a hotel in Cardiff and died on Thursday, August 27, 2020
As well as writing to Cardiff and Vale University Health Board in a last-ditch cry for help, she penned a letter to her mum, dad and two younger sisters, Tesni and Cerys
She said she wanted us to know that she had the best childhood ever and that we'd done nothing wrong
It was just heartbreaking, added Haydn
We had literally lost all hope
We couldn't find a way of going forward and her mental health team had locked her in this cocoon and insisted that this was the therapy she should be having
Haydn, who is now seeing a therapist himself, added: Now I'm retired, you see photographs of her around the house all the time and it brings it all back
I've been miserable, tired and angry - I think we all have
Her heartbroken family claims that if they had been given more of a say in her care - which would have led to a more tailored and bespoke approach - she could still be alive today
They said Bronwen experienced a devastating injustice in her care and was treated with a blanket approach which had little effect on improving her mental health
Since the tragedy, Bronwen's family have set up Bronwen's Wish, a charity which aims to provide safe spaces for young people experiencing challenges with their mental health
It aims to provide wellbeing pods in primary and secondary schools which will act as quiet, relaxing and safe places for pupils who want to talk about their mental health
In June, Haydn and his dog Celog plan to walk the entire Pembrokeshire coastal path in one go - the equivalent distance to climbing Everest - to raise money for Bronwen's Wish
To donate to the challenge, dubbed 'Man and Mutt climb Everest', please go here
It'll take three weeks in all as I have arthritis in both knees so I'll likely need some rest days
We'll use a few campsites along the way, do some wild camping and hopefully a night on the sofa halfway around
I know Bron will be in my thoughts the whole time
A full inquest into Bronwen's death is set to take place between May 23 and 25 and the family are making a complaint against Cardiff and Vale University Health Board for failures in her care
A spokeswoman for the health board said: Our thoughts are with the family and friends of Bronwen at this incredibly sad time
An investigation report has been shared with the family and we reiterate the offer for a further meeting to discuss the findings

Police in the US believe prisoner Casey White wasn't smart enough to plan the breakout and said exemplary employee Vicky White was in the perfect position to organise it all A prison guard who took her own life after being on the run with a murderer for 11 days was the mastermind behind the the whole plan, police believe
Hulking 6ft9 prisoner Casey White - alleged to have been officer Vicky White's lover - wasn't smart enough to plan it all, according to Lauderdale County Sheriff Rick Singleton
In an interview with CNN, Singleton said 56-year-old Vicky - who he described as an exemplary employee - was in a position to coordinate the jailbreak, organising a van in the morning and ensuring all the armed deputies were not in the building
She knew that the booking officer wasn’t going to question her, the assistant director, when she told her that she was going to take him to court and drop him off with other employees, Singleton told the network
Not long before she died by suicide, Vicky seemed to be angry at Casey, 38, for deciding to stay at a motel
Some of her last words were recorded by police as officers rammed into the pair's Cadillac into a ditch after a dramatic chase
She's heard saying: Airbags are going off
Let’s get out and run
And then: You had to stay in some f****** motel
Vicky, who had made up a bogus medical appointment for the felon on April 29, shot herself moments later
Singleton said wigs, weapons including an AR-15 rifle, a 9mm handgun and $29,000 worth of cash had also been found
He said Vicky had sold her house to raise the funds
She would have been facing up to 10 years in prison for helping Casey escape
Singleton said Vicky, formerly second command at Alabama's Lauderdale County Jail, was a much liked, respected employee who other staff viewed as a mother figure
She was even about to be awarded Employee of the Year for the fifth time
What in the world provoked her, or prompted her, to pull something like this, I don’t know
I don’t know if we’ll ever know, he said
I had every bit of trust in Vicky White
She had been an exemplary employee
Casey appeared before a judge in Alabama on Tuesday night charged with escaping prison
Previously Vanderburgh County Sheriff Dave Wedding said that because a large number of guns were found inside the car, if Vicky and Casey they had not been rammed off the road the day could have ended with more bloodshed
He told reporters: We later found out that [if they hadn’t rammed the vehicle], the fugitive was going to engage in a shootout with law enforcement
That action may have saved many of my deputies and fellow law enforcement officers’ lives
The couple, who were not related, are said to have been in a jailhouse romance for around two years
Their dramatic escape came on the eve of Vicky’s retirement as a correctional officer
Since their 2020 meeting, Vicky had regularly been driving the two hours to where Casey was incarcerated, at the William E Donaldson Correctional Facility
She gave a false name to prison authorities

Emma Armstrong's daughter Libby Crossfield will only eat Aldi's Weetabix and its organic Mamia baby food, and either spaghetti bolognese or spaghetti with tomato and mozzarella sauce A mum has been forced to beg with Aldi for help in a desperate battle to get her hands on the only food her autistic daughter will eat
Emma Armstrong's daughter Libby Crossfield will only eat Aldi's own brand of Weetabix and its organic Mamia baby food, and either spaghetti bolognese or spaghetti with tomato and mozzarella sauce, Manchester Evening News reports
Mum-of-three Emma has always kept well stocked up on the products as she knows that Libby, who has profound social and communication difficulties and suffers from sensory issues, will refuse to eat anything else
But with supermarkets struggling with certain supplies, she's down to her last few tubs and only has enough to last until lunchtime on Saturday, which is Libby's fourth birthday
The panicked mother, from Failsworth, Oldham, has been driving around Aldi stores across Greater Manchester to check for stock and leave her number with managers and she's been in touch with the manufacturer to establish when the retailer was due its next delivery
It might seem like a small issue to some people but we're just hitting a brick wall, she told Manchester Evening News
Aldi are not helping at all other than a standard response
I know they have the stock, the manufacturer told me it arrived from France at the weekend
I just need them to get some to me
Family and friends have been on the hunt too, including Emma's sister Adele, whose tweet has been shared more than 200 times - with strangers as far as Aberdeen and Northern Ireland checking their own stores for stock
And it's a lot more serious than Libby just not having the food she likes on her birthday
Emma says eating wheat cereal alone will leave the youngster poorly and malnourished and if she has a period without the baby food, she may struggle to reintroduce it to Libby's diet
Emma, who works in a restaurant and also has five-year-old twin boys Frankie and Finley, said: She used to eat more of a variety of baby food but this has decreased to these particular foods
My concern is that if this food is taken away from her diet for a time I won’t be able to reintroduce it, this will lead to malnutrition and eventually we could end up with tube feeding or peg feeding
She added that it's become like a full-time job trying to track down the food and everything else, including trying to sort a specialist school place for Libby has had to be put on the back burner
An Aldi spokesperson said: We are sorry to hear that Emma hasn’t been able to find our Mamia dishes in store
We are working hard with our supplier to deliver Libby’s favourite Mamia dishes to her directly in time for her big birthday

Helen believes the narrow-minded person was sparked into writing the note after the saw her walking away and told of other times where she had received verbal abuse A mum has hit out at the narrow-minded ignorant person who left a note on her car saying they were going to report her for using a blue badge just because they saw me walking away
Helen had come back from a walk to help ease the pain for a back issue that sees her qualify for a blue badge when she saw the rude note left on the windscreen of her car, the MEN reports
Scrawled in block capitals, the note read: Your BB has been taken and reported to the ticket office
The mum has slammed the person who left the note as being ignorant and believes they thought she was fraudulently using one just because they saw her walking away
Helen, who has a son with autism, said the incident highlights how disabilities are not always visible, and that a person does not have to justify themselves to others
Just because I’m young and not in wheelchair doesn’t mean I’m not entitled to a blue badge, she said, They obviously saw me, saw that I'm in my 40s, walking away
And I just thought they've got no idea what my circumstances are
Helen had gone for a Sunday stroll in her local park to help manage her really bad back that she has had numerous spinal surgeries on
She also has nerve damage in her legs
And she recalled other incidents where unkind members of the public had launched a verbal assault on her just because her disability isn't visible
Someone once said to me 'are you travelling around with a dead relative's blue badge', she said
Another time when her son was aged six or seven and a man with a stick called her a f***ing b**ch
Helen then shoved her blue badge in his face and said: Are you happy now? The mum recently lost a friend to cancer, who also had a blue badge, and hypothesised how they would have felt if they had gone for my last walk ever to come back and find a similar note on their car
What is happening where you live? Find out by adding your postcode
What if I had been her, and I was here to take my last walk ever, and I came back to this message? How rude can some people be, she said
She says that whenever she goes to Tesco she gets people staring at her
In other circumstances she would confront people by saying things like do you want to see the scars down my back?
There was no way for Helen to respond to the person who left this note
But, Helen says she knows whoever left it has absolutely no life

Nick Phillips, 39, was working the night shift on Tuesday, August 30, when he was alerted by a member of staff that a woman had reportedly locked herself in the toilets in the Winter Gardens in an apparent attempt to take her own life and was unresponsive An ex-army man turned Morrisons manager saved a woman's life inside the store toilets
Nick Phillips, 39, was working the night shift on Tuesday, August 30, at the Southport branch when he was alerted by a member of staff that something serious had happened
A woman had reportedly locked herself in the toilets in the Winter Gardens in an apparent attempt to take her own life and was unresponsive
After knocking on the door, Mr Phillips broke down the door to get to the woman
He performed emergency CPR on the woman and she began breathing again, reports the Liverpool Echo
Both the police and ambulance services were called, and the woman was taken to hospital where she would receive further treatment
As an ex-army and former prison officer, Mr Phillips knew exactly what to do
His previous training meant that he knew compact CPR, and he has a history of tending to people in need
His wife, Catherine Phillips, said: Because of his experience, his brain goes into this mode where he does exactly what he needs to do to get stuff done, I’ve never known anyone like him
He gets the job done, so when this happened, I don’t know who the girl is, but she couldn't have wished for anyone better to come and save her life
He is the most resilient person I’ve ever met in my life
Catherine said her husband stayed on shift for hours after the incident to ensure that his staff were okay and felt supported
A spokesperson for North West Ambulance Service said: I can confirm an ambulance attended and took a patient to hospital

Chris Lam died on April 7 after suffering from with depression since the Hilllsborough disaster in 1989 and had spent his life campaigning tirelessly for justice A daughter has paid tribute to her best friend dad who died at the age of 52 after suffering depression since surviving the Hilllsborough tragedy
Chris Lam died on April 7 this year having spent his life campaigning tirelessly for justice having survived the 1989 Hilllsborough disaster that claimed the lives of 97 people
His daughter Rebecca said he struggled with the tragedy since then
Rebecca told the Liverpool Echo : He was a Hillsborough survivor, he's struggled a lot since then, and always struggled in April in the lead up to the anniversary
She said: We knew he was struggling but we've all said none of us expected he would have done anything like this
Paying tribute to her dad, Rebecca said he was a well known and genuine man, who was part of Widnes Running Club where he was known by the nickname Mr Widnes
Rebecca added: He was genuine, he was full of life, always willing to give a hand to anybody
He was there for anybody to have a chat
He was like my best friend, we just bounced off each other
We kept each other going, he's always been my rock
He was so well known we couldn't go anywhere without him bumping into somebody that he knew
She has now set up a Gofundme page to raise money for the Hillsborough Survivors Support Alliance, who provided counselling to her dad, and Amparo, a charity that offers support to anyone affected by suicide
On the page she says: Chris was a wonderful man who brought happiness wherever he went
He was warm, kind, generous, funny, a sportsman, a supporter, a friend to many, a loved one and a doting father
He was also a massive Liverpool FC supporter and a Hillsborough survivor
He campaigned tirelessly for justice and felt passionately about the work of the HSA
He very sadly ended his own life in April 2022
Amparo have offered invaluable support to his loved ones during this difficult time
We believe that raising money for these two organisations in his name will help leave a positive legacy

Catalin Micu, 54, killed mum-of-one Ramona Stoia, 35, in a suspected murder-suicide on April 11 in at their tattoo studio called GothInk Studio in Canterbury, Kent A tattoo artist stabbed his wife to death in an unprovoked attack before turning the knife on himself in the studio where they worked, an inquest heard today
Catalin Micu, 54, killed mum-of-one Ramona Stoia, 35, in a suspected murder-suicide on April 11 in Canterbury, Kent
Not long after their deaths it came out that Micu was facing allegations he raped Ramona multiple times throughout their marriage
The couple has a young child together
Micu was on police bail when he was found dead at their GothInk Studio with Ramona
Micu died from a stab wound to the stomach, an inquest into his death at County Hall in Maidstone, Kent heard
An earlier hearing this week heard Ramona suffered a knife wound to her neck
Coroner Katrina Hepburn said Micu killed his wife before he was seen going behind a curtain before his death
Before the apparent murder-suicide, Micu was interviewed by police after his wife accused him of multiple sexual assaults against her
Kent Police then referred itself to police watchdog the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) following its contact with the couple before their deaths
The IPOC has since confirmed it will not be investigating and the force will be left to carry out its own probe into the handling of the case
The watchdog added that it will scrutinise the results of the internal investigation
On April 11, dozens of armed police swooped in at the studio at about 5
20pm, where they found the couple dead
Detectives are not looking for anyone else in connection to their deaths
Ramona's is being treated as suspicious and Micu's is not, police said
Ramona's death led to an outpouring of tributes, where she was a well-known tattoo artist in the community
A collage of pictures of Ramona has since been put up on the doors of the shop, along with dozens of flowers, candles and written tributes
One heartfelt poem, called Shining Star, reads: A shining star snatched from our sky
The question we ask ourselves is why? A wonderful spirit loved by all
An amazing lady so beautiful
Taken by the angels in such a cruel way
So heartbroken can't find the words to say
The tattoos you created are your legacy
Up in heaven now spirit flying free
A tribute left at the scene reads: RIP Ramona
You were a beautiful soul
You will be missed so much

In February, Ramona secured a non-molestation order - a court injunction restricting or banning contact - against Micu
The tattoo artists married in Las Vegas four years ago but are understood to have recently separated
It is thought the couple - who have a young son - continued to live together, but Micu was banned from harassing or pestering her
On March 26, Micu was arrested on suspicion of having breached this order, and of seriously sexually assaulting his wife
Ramona came forward with a series of historic allegations of rape against her husband, dating back throughout their 16-year relationship but primarily taking place in the last few years
There were five separate allegations, all of which reportedly took place at the family home
Following his arrest, Micu was placed on police bail until April 20
Anyone who has any concerns or information regarding the incident is asked to contact the police via the Kent Police website or by calling 101, quoting 11-0995, or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111

Get email updates with the day's biggest stories Catalin Micu, 54, killed mum-of-one Ramona Stoia, 35, in a suspected murder-suicide on April 11 in at their tattoo studio called GothInk Studio in Canterbury, Kent A tattoo artist stabbed his wife to death in an unprovoked attack before turning the knife on himself in the studio where they worked, an inquest heard today
Catalin Micu, 54, killed mum-of-one Ramona Stoia, 35, in a suspected murder-suicide on April 11 in Canterbury, Kent
Not long after their deaths it came out that Micu was facing allegations he raped Ramona multiple times throughout their marriage
The couple has a young child together
Micu was on police bail when he was found dead at their GothInk Studio with Ramona
Micu died from a stab wound to the stomach, an inquest into his death at County Hall in Maidstone, Kent heard
An earlier hearing this week heard Ramona suffered a knife wound to her neck
Coroner Katrina Hepburn said Micu killed his wife before he was seen going behind a curtain before his death
Before the apparent murder-suicide, Micu was interviewed by police after his wife accused him of multiple sexual assaults against her
Kent Police then referred itself to police watchdog the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) following its contact with the couple before their deaths
The IPOC has since confirmed it will not be investigating and the force will be left to carry out its own probe into the handling of the case
The watchdog added that it will scrutinise the results of the internal investigation
On April 11, dozens of armed police swooped in at the studio at about 5
20pm, where they found the couple dead
Detectives are not looking for anyone else in connection to their deaths
Ramona's is being treated as suspicious and Micu's is not, police said
Ramona's death led to an outpouring of tributes, where she was a well-known tattoo artist in the community
A collage of pictures of Ramona has since been put up on the doors of the shop, along with dozens of flowers, candles and written tributes
One heartfelt poem, called Shining Star, reads: A shining star snatched from our sky
The question we ask ourselves is why? A wonderful spirit loved by all
An amazing lady so beautiful
Taken by the angels in such a cruel way
So heartbroken can't find the words to say
The tattoos you created are your legacy
Up in heaven now spirit flying free
A tribute left at the scene reads: RIP Ramona
You were a beautiful soul
You will be missed so much
Another says: I never knew you but unfortunately can relate to your experiences
You deserved to be here and free of violence
I hope you have some sense of peace

Police officer David Loudon left a family holiday in Wales early and killed himself and son Harrison while his wife and step-children were still away in a tragic set of events A police sergeant who was driven mad by the coronavirus lockdown gassed his three-year-old autistic son to death before killing himself
David Loudon, an officer with West Mercia police, was suffering from depression and anxiety, an inquest heard today
The bodies of the sergeant and his son Harrison were found at their Kidderminster home in August 2021 while the rest of their family were away on holiday
Mr Loudon left a suicide note for his wife saying she'd be better off without him
The court heard how the boy had recently been diagnosed with suspected autism and his behaviour was proving challenging
Covid and the subsequent lockdowns and restrictions had also led to Mr Loudon being unable to get the face-to-face medical attention he felt he and Harrison needed
He left the family holiday in Wales early and killed himself and Harrison while his wife and step-children were still away, Stourport Coroner's Court heard
Mr Loudon had meticulously planned the deaths and also left notes for his family and sent letters to his friends, explaining that he had decided to take his own life and the reasons why
Worcestershire Coroner, David Reid, returned conclusions that Mr Loudon had taken his own life while Harrison Loudon had been unlawfully killed
The inquest had heard how in the various letters and notes he left, he said he was now with Harrison and the angels in heaven, Birmingham Live reports
The tragedy happened at the Loudon's home in Cairndhu Drive, Kidderminster, on August 13 last year
Mr Loudon's wife, Sam, who is also a West Mercia Police officer, told how they had been at a caravan park in Rhyl with her two children and also her in-laws
She told how her husband had made it clear that he didn't want to be there as he was feeling very low in his mood and also felt physically unwell
Harrison was also having frequent meltdowns, the hearing was told
Three days into the holiday, it was decided that Mr Loudon would take Harrison home
In her statement read to the inquest, Mrs Loudon said she had lots of phone calls and text messages with her husband in the following days and everything seemed fine
But on the morning of August 13 she couldn't get hold of her husband on the phone
She also noticed on the camera the family had installed in Harrison's bedroom that he was in bed but hadn't changed position for several hours
I got a knot in my stomach - I knew something was not right, her statement said
I knew Dave was low but I had no idea that suicide was being contemplated, it was never discussed and wasn't a concern
She said a few months previously Mr Loudon had told her I think you and Harrison would be better off without me
She said she thought he meant he was going to leave them and never for a second imagined he was planning suicide
Mrs Loudon rang the police and they forced an entry into the house and found the body of Mr Loudon and Harrison in their respective bedrooms
A post mortem examination for both of them concluded they had died of asphyxiation
The inquest had heard how Mr Loudon went to his GP the year before this happened and said he was feeling low, depressed and anxious, but not suicidal
He was prescribed anti-depressants, but didn't take them, and also had six counselling sessions which were arranged by West Mercia Police
Detective Inspector Mark Walters from West Mercia Police, who carried out an investigation into the double-death, said they were well planned
He said an examination of his phone revealed extensive searches
Several notes and letters were found
One was for his wife, Sam, in which he spoke about his fears for Harrison’s future
I can’t watch Harrison regress and become scared and confused with the world around him
I can’t let that destroy us, the pressure and my diseased mind won out I couldn’t see that this would get anything than worse
He also wrote: The only way is to die, I couldn’t leave you with Harrison, it would be too much
I did it out of love and desperation
In her most recent statement, which was read out to the inquest, Mrs Loudon said: I felt devastated that he didn’t tell me how he was feeling - he had lost hope in everything
I loved him very much but it was an unforgivable decision, I wished he had told me
I will never be able to forgive David for taking the life of our little boy Harrison - he had no right to take my son’s life, regardless of how he was feeling

Daryl McWilliam, 24, was found dead in his hotel room after drunkenly texting his girlfriend of 12 months that he didn't want to 'be with her anymore' An amazing 24-year-old dad took his own life after splitting up with his girlfriend during a weekend away in Blackpool
An inquest heard Daryl McWilliam had travelled to the seaside resort with his girlfriend of 12 months, Natalie Jones
The couple, from Kilmarnock, Scotland, visited Wetherspoons for something to eat before returning to their room at Garvey's Promenade Hotel on Saturday February 26
The pair then decided to go back out and visit three pubs in Blackpool town centre, Lancs Live reports
Towards the end of the night, it is reported that Daryl, 24, became increasingly intoxicated and, after becoming separated from Natalie, he sent her a text saying: I don't want to be with you anymore
Shocked at this, Natalie then made several attempts to contact Daryl who eventually returned to the hotel at around midnight
The couple had an argument, during which Daryl damaged Natalie's phone and other belongings in the room, before she started to pack her things into their car
When Natalie went back to the room, Daryl wasn't there, and so she went downstairs to the bar to look for him
A short while later Natalie went back up to the room where she found Daryl unconscious
Paramedics and police were called but despite extensive resuscitation efforts Daryl was pronounced dead at 1. 37am on February 27
The cause of death was given as hanging
An inquest at Blackpool Town Hall today (Tuesday July 19) heard that Daryl, a pipe-fitter at Kilmaurs engineering firm A&L Mechanical Installations, had no history of mental health issues
He had visited the GP with his mum in 2020 for help with low mood but he was not known to the community mental health team
The content of the messages sent by Daryl indicate he was intoxicated
This tragic incident would appear to have stemmed from the breakdown of the relationship on a night which involved alcohol consumption
Assistant Coroner Louise Rae returned a conclusion of suicide
She said: Daryl McWilliam was on holiday in Blackpool with his partner
Following an argument she returned to the room to find him hanging
He was not known to mental health services
I agree this was a tragic incident which stemmed from the breakdown of a relationship
In terms of the evidence. .
I don't believe anybody could have acted sooner
It is difficult to find any conclusion other than suicide. .
I am therefore satisfied that the only conclusion possible and the one that I reach is the short-form conclusion of suicide
A fundraiser launched after Daryl's death, to help his parents Heather and John pay for the funeral, raised more than £2,200
Daryl's girlfriend Natalie paid tribute to him after his death, as reported by the Daily Record, in which she described him as the most amazing person she had ever known
She added: You showed me what true love actually is
I will always love you Daryl
I really wish I had gotten more time with you and got to do everything we planned on
You never failed to make me smile whenever I felt down and I can’t thank you enough for how happy you made me

Pictures of Steffan Rees are not what people expect to see after he took his own life
They show pure joy and happiness as he teaches his baby niece a joyful song The final images of a man before his life ended are what his family want everyone to see
Pictures of Steffan Rees are not what people expect to see after he took his own life
They show pure joy and happiness as he teaches his baby niece If You Are Happy And You Know It
Stefan's sister Sian, from Cardigan, Wales, says her brother was the life and soul of the party and the kind of person who lit up the room when he arrived
Wales On line reports it is why his suicide was such a shock and drives his devastated sister to help others
She said: I couldn't have asked for a better brother
He was only 26, had a loving family, a beautiful girlfriend, and didn't say anything about having any mental health issues
Since his death Sian has tried to find positives
Together with widows Lisa and Ana, who have also been bereaved through suicide, they have set up a support group and taken part in a UK awareness campaign
New research from suicide prevention charity Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) has found that 61% of people would struggle to tell if someone they knew felt suicidal
The charity wants to raise awareness that the ‘face of suicide’ isn’t always crying and being recluse
A person might seem happy on the outside, and to illustrate this, the charity has unveiled an exhibition on London’s Southbank called 'The Last Photo'
The outdoor gallery displays 50 smiling photos taken in the last days of people who died by suicide
It also shares the stories of shock and grief their families and friends experienced
A photograph of Steffan forms part of the moving exhibition, as do the pictures of Peter Hammett, from Swansea, and Lee, from Tenby
Along with Sian, Peter's wife Lisa and Lee's wife Ana have set up a support group - LISS - Living in Suicide Shadow because they felt there was a lack of support for those bereaved by suicide
Ana said: We are a peer-to-peer support group that aims to break the 'isolation' that we often find ourselves in by organising face to face and virtual meet ups, walks, family activities with people that understand the pain of suicide
The latest figures show that 125 people die by suicide every week in the UK, but it can be hard to spot the signs something isn’t okay Just months after Ana's husband died of suicide another CALM's project called 84, which represented the number of people who died every week in the UK in 2018, was launched
Ana, whose children were nine and six when her husband died, said: The 84 project floored me
It had such a powerful message; I couldn't believe 84 men took their lives every week… so many families, friends, and communities heartbroken
Suddenly, my husband's individual act was not so individual anymore
If the suicide average was constant, how can we blame such rates of suicide on one individual's reckless decision? It felt much more like a social issue, and if it was the case, then we could do something about it
Talking about this campaign she said: I will never forget those beautiful smiles of those beautiful people… beautiful children, beautiful women, handsome men, different ages, different genders, different social classes, different ethnicities, proof that suicide can happen to anyone
The shadows of the leaves moving with the wind and the sun created movement in the photos
I kept looking and hoping that they would start moving
And even though it was so comforting to see a life-size picture, I found it so hard to leave the exhibition; I wanted to bring him home with me, we miss Lee so much! The picture of Lee, who was 41 when he died, was taken in Castell Henllys, Pembrokeshire, on a wonderful day out with friends
There were Roman attacks, and Celtic victories, plenty of laughter and at one point Lee had all the kids shoeless crossing the stream in the cold April
Never in a million years would any of us believe that he would be gone less than a couple of months later
Our children were only six and nine when he died
He loved them to bits and was always with them
They would say 'but daddy was always happy with he was with me'
It was not long after Lee's death that Ana met Lisa, through Dr Dai Lloyd, an MS who has been heavily involved in suicide prevention campaigns
Ana added: Things have moved on a lot in recent years, but there is a lot of stigma around suicide
People would say things like he is your husband, you live with him, how did you not see it, some people blame you for it, others don't know what to say
It is said that we lose around 70% of our circle of family and friends as it is difficult for people to understand and support our grief
Being able to talk with other people who have been through the same experience has helped
The group has helped the three form a close bond
We have been on a journey together the last couple of years and it seemed fitting that we should all be taking part in The Last Photo campaign and supporting each other, she said
The exhibition was held on the Southbank somewhere I'd previously visited with my family including Peter with such happy memories
My immediate reaction when I saw the life size photo of Peter was to cry
I placed my hand upon his face in disbelief remembering this photo I had taken on our 33rd wedding anniversary just three months before he died
She added: When Peter died I was determined to make a stand against the stigma associated with suicide and for his death not to be in vein I'm so proud we all took part in CALMs The Last Photo campaign
We hope all our stories make a difference and ultimately save lives

Nicola Cassidy is launching a legal battle in a desperate bid to free her son from his life in a box where she says his care is worse than being in prison, his meals are pushed through a hatch and he is constantly watched via CCTV A young man with autism has been locked up in an old file room with his meals pushed through a hatch for more than four years according to his desperate mum
Patient A, 24, lives at private psychiatric facility, Cheadle Royal Hospital in Greater Manchester, which is part of the Priory group
His mother, Nicola Cassidy, 49, says his movements inside the tiny room, are constantly tracked by CCTV, he has no physical contact with anybody and his meals are slid through a gap in the bottom of a wooden hatch
Patient A, who also has a learning disability and Tourette's syndrome, has been detained under the Mental Health Act since September 2017 in what his mum claims is an old file room at the back of the hospital
Now Nicola from Liverpool is preparing to launch a legal battle to have him released from his life in a box adding that people wouldn't treat an animal like they do her son and his care is worse than being in prison
She said: We fully appreciate that my son has complex needs but he's being treated terribly
He's locked away from the world and has no physical contact with anyone
For his meals to be pushed through a tiny gap in the bottom of the hatch is awful
People wouldn't treat an animal that way and I feel that his care is worse than being in prison
He has challenges but is a loving and caring person who needs stimulation and support
He is getting nothing at present
I can't even hold his hand or hug him because of the conditions he's kept in
The desperate mum is taking her case to the Court of Protection in the hopes a judge will review her son's sectioning under the Mental Health Act - and with the help of Liverpool's Clinical Commissioning Group and Council get him back into a home in the community
Currently, Patient A has a bedroom, a bathroom and a small lounge area, plus a snug or sensory room, where he often sleeps, under the eye of a CCTV camera at Cheadle Royal Hospital

Nicola says he is looked after by staff at a ratio of five to one and when his room needs cleaning he is shut in a separate area, such as an area of garden, closed off by high metal fencing
She believes with the right support her son will flourish and be able to spend more time with his family
She said: Every time I see him it breaks my heart
He has no quality of life, he just exists
I've been told by some of those involved in my son's care that things aren't working and Patient A could, with the right support, be cared for in the community
It's difficult not to think that the longer he's left, the worse his condition will become, until the point where he's unable to be released.  This isn't about money
He has five carers assigned to him all the time
That level of staffing is costly and is probably a waste of money given that he has no contact with anyone
We keep asking for more to be done to support my son but nothing seems to happen
We've been left with no choice other than to take this action
All I want is what any mum would want and that is the best for their son so he can try and make the most of his life
Nicola says her son had a typical childhood up until around the age of 12
He was diagnosed as autistic aged seven, then later with Tourette's and a learning disability
It was around the age of 14 that his family started to struggle with managing the changes in his mental state and Patient A hit crisis point
He left his family home to go into residential care aged 14 in 2012 and was moved from placement to placement
He was admitted to Mersey Lodge ward in Cheadle Royal Hospital on September 5, 2017, where he has stayed ever since
Kirsty Stuart, an expert public law and human rights lawyer at Irwin Mitchell representing Patient A and Nicola, said: This is yet another case where the loved ones of people with autism and/or a learning disability are detained in units which were not designed to care for people such as Patient A
The first-hand account we've heard from Nicola about what's happening to her son is probably the worst I've heard
Understandably Patient A's family are deeply concerned
We're now investigating these concerns and how the legal process can help the family
We call on The Priory, the CCG and local authority to work with ourselves and Patient A's family to reach an agreement over his care, which the family believe should be in the community as this would give him the best quality of life
A total of 2,040 people with learning disabilities and/or autism were in the hospitals at the end of August 2021, according to NHS Digital figures
Of those, 1,145 - 56 percent - had been in hospital for a total of more than two years
The average cost to the taxpayer of keeping a person detained in hospital is thought to be £3,563 per week or £185,276 per year
But the Priory Group, which runs the private psychiatric hospital, has denied Nicola's claims that food is slid under the hatch to her son
The group claim the facility is purpose-built and while it does have a serving hatch in the door, they say it is a large square space where items of various sizes can be passed though including his food on a tray
A spokesman for the group also said the accommodation was fully renovated to provide the care package that has been commissioned by the Clinical Commissioning Group
The group added the family provided input at the time on the design and were supportive of the accommodation being provided
A Priory spokesman said: The welfare of the people we look after is our number one priority
We are fully committed to the Transforming Care agenda and to ensuring well-planned transfers to the most appropriate community settings whenever they become available
Our Adult Care division has successfully provided at least 39 such placements, with positive outcomes for the individuals involved
Unfortunately, however, some individuals with highly complex behaviours, and detained under the Mental Health Act, can be difficult to place despite all parties working very hard together over a long period of time to find the right setting
At all times we work closely with families, commissioners, and NHSE to ensure patients are receiving the safest, most appropriate care in our facilities
That care is delivered and kept under regular review by a multi-disciplinary team of experts, including a consultant psychiatrist and an NHS autism specialist, and independently reviewed by commissioners
Staff provide round-the-clock support at Mersey Lodge and all interventions are carefully and continually reviewed, monitored and assessed to ensure they are in the best interests of patients, with the aim of achieving the least restrictive setting possible
Medication is always prescribed by a consultant psychiatrist, and where patients are detained under the MHA, agreed by a second, independent doctor from the CQC
We aim to reduce medications to the lowest possible doses to keep people safe
Specialist placements - whether residential or in the community - require significant funding and are commissioned by the NHS or Clinical Commissioning Groups who have statutory obligations to achieve the best value and the highest possible quality
Priory provides these placements as they are commissioned with considerable input from families and funders in order to make sure the environment and care provided are appropriate
Priory is always ready and willing to participate in any review of a placement as part of the Transforming Care programme

Mental health campaigner Trevor Coult has shared his devastation at losing Pete Carson who served in the Royal Irish Regiment with Trevor in Afghanistan and was found dead in a suspected suicide A decorated war hero is mourning his 13th ­comrade lost to the armed forces mental health crisis
Campaigner Trevor Coult, who won the Military Cross for service in Iraq, was devastated to learn last week of the latest death
Pete Carson, who served in the Royal Irish Regiment with Trevor in Afghanistan, was found dead in a suspected suicide
Anguished Trevor, 47, said: In any other profession there would be calls for a major inquiry – but it seems the Government doesn’t mind if those who served their country kill themselves
He added: I was absolutely devastated to learn that Pete had died
That’s at least six people from my old regiment who have died and at least 13 people who I knew or served with have now taken their own lives
There have been more deaths
I don’t think there is any job in the country where someone would know so many people who have taken their own lives
The 12 others who Trevor knew include fellow Afghan vet Brett Savage, 32, who had taken part in a documentary in which he said the Ministry of Defence was not doing enough to help
Before he died he spoke about combat in Afghanistan and said: My unit was under fire for 55 days.  It was non-stop
I saw good men killed
We lost four in total
I was blown up with an RPG and lost the hearing in my right ear
I was also shot in the chest, the body armour saved my life.  I went crazy
I was on drugs, drinking all the time
Shortly after Brett’s death, Sgt Fraser Stirling, also a member of the Royal Irish Regiment and a one-time colleague of Trevor’s, took his own life aged 30
The other tragedies include Northern Ireland veteran Deane Hart, 53, and Capt Gary Case, a veteran of Iraq, who died weeks after being awarded an MBE
Capt Case, 50, had gained ­promotion from the ranks and was one of the most popular officers in the Rifles regiment
Another of those who died was Jamie Davis, also a former member of the Rifles
The 30-year-old dad-of-two hanged himself in January 2020
He had previously suffered shrapnel wounds and witnessed the deaths of colleagues in both Iraq and Afghanistan
His widow Alicia said he had nightmares night and day and was ashamed of his condition
She added: He was screaming in the middle of the night
He was riddled with guilt
One of his best mates got killed and he said that should have been him
The other soldiers and veterans in confirmed or suspected suicides are Danny Johnston, 35, Mitchell Matthews, 24, James Ross, 30, Paul Cochrane, 18, Eddie Murphy, 50, Andy McFarland, 32 and Paul Brennan
Dad of one Trevor, from Suffolk, added: The MoD says that the deaths have nothing in common and there isn’t a problem with suicide
All of those who died had mental health issues, they had all seen combat and they all served in the armed forces – that’s what they had in common
Since 2017 at least 350 veterans and service personnel are believed to have taken their own lives
At least 22 have died from suspected suicides so far this year
The vast majority had seen combat
The MoD said: There are many ­varied and complex reasons why ­someone may take their own life and we will continue to do all that we can to provide support and mental health ­provision to those who have ­dedicated their lives to the service of this country
The Sunday People ’s Save Our Soldiers campaign is calling for a radical overhaul of the way top brass treat mental health

Friends of Mehlika Derici watched in horror as her boyfriend clasped his arms round her waist and flung himself from the cliff in Turkey, dragging her with him to their deaths The chilling final words of a jealous boyfriend who threw himself off a cliff, dragging his beautiful girlfriend with him have been revealed by horrified witnesses
Police are investigating the suspected murder-suicide after the couple fell 82ft to their deaths, in Marmara Ereglisi, Tekirdag Province, Turkey, on August 6
Landowner, Selcuk Cetiner, 41, and beautician Mehlika Derici, 35, had been enjoying a meal with another couple to celebrate their friend's birthday, just hours before the tragic incident
After the meal the pair had gone with the other couple to a nearby lookout point known as Asiklar Tepesi, or Lovers' Hill
But a row broke out between them and Cetiner pushed Mehlika to the ground before friend, Merve Y, 32, and her boyfriend, Arda Tolunay Y, 26, picked her back up
Merve and her boyfriend Arda claim they heard Cetiner then shout if we die, we die together as clasped his arms round Mehlika's waist and dragged her over the edge, before she had time to react
Paramedics were called to the scene but were only able to declare them dead
The group had been drinking in the restaurant and had carried on at the viewpoint
The couple's bodies were taken to the morgue at Marmara Ereglisi Public Hospital, while police seized their mobile phones for analysis
Some local reports said Mehlika was mother to two children
Femicide is a growing problem in Turkey, particularly after the country officially quit the Istanbul Convention in July last year
According to the 2021 Annual Data Report by the 'We Will Stop Femicide Platform', 280 women were killed by men in 2021, while 217 women were found suspiciously dead
According to data from the 'Monument Counter' - a digital memorial for women killed by violence that is updated daily - 246 femicides have taken place in Turkey so far this year

Damilya Jussipaliyeva's boyfriend sent the revenge porn to a friend and threatened to show it to her family - coroner's court heard she was in a 'disturbed state' before taking her own life A business student whose boyfriend shared a revenge porn film of her with a friend took her own life in a disturbed state, a coroner has found
Damilya Jussipaliyeva, 21, plunged 80ft to her death a week after Alessio Bianchi sent the video of her performing a sex act on him in a phone booth to a friend
Alessio, 30, was so angered by her spreading rumours about him he had threatened to show her family the clip and said he would also send them footage of her taking cocaine
Damilya left a suicide note which read: Alessio I love you, sorry
Another said: Mommy and Daddy I'm sorry
Hours before her death, Damilya and Alessio had fought outside his flat and he pushed her into a fountain, Inner West London Coroner's Court heard
Recording a narrative verdict, assistant coroner Bernard Richmond said: This is a tragic case
Her mind was plainly disturbed and in that state she formed an intention to kill herself
Electronic devices showed she had been searching for methods of suicides, terraces and heights, the inquest heard
There had been a rapid deterioration in her mental health in the last few days, the coroner said
She was in a very disturbed state immediately prior to her death
The coroner confirmed Damilya's injuries were consistent with a fall from a great height
He said there were no injuries, indicative of assault or restraint by a third party
The coroner said Damilya had suffered stress, depression and anxiety due to a number if factors, including her relationship with her family, her own drug and alcohol use, difficulties in coping with her degree course and her relationship with her boyfriend
The coroner described how Damilya had tried to take her own life twice before and was stopped from doing so
She said that by June 1, 2017 the student's mental state had significantly deteriorated
Shortly before she died at 1
20am, Damilya's mind was plainly disturbed and in that state she formed that intention to kill herself evidenced by goodbye notes to her parents and partner
Alessio, who was born in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia and Damilya, who was from Kazakhstan, had been in an on-off relationship for two-and-a-half years
They met at Regent's University in 2017 where they were both studying business
Alessio said: She was a sweet girl.  We had similar personalities.  We had similar backgrounds
The couple's friends were aware of their tumultuous relationship and Alessio had reported her to police himself on several occasions, when she had scratched him and she had attempted suicide
He told the inquest he had prevented a suicide attempt by Ms in September 2016
The court heard they were both using drugs, including cocaine, cannabis and ketamine, as well as alcohol
She was sent a video recording on WhatsApp of her in the phone booth in north London, on May 25, 2017
Attached was a message saying: I am going to keep destroying you
One of her friends received the same clip from three different numbers, with one containing the threat: I will f**k you up next, my love
Alessio claimed she had been spreading rumours about him and he sent the sex video to make her stop

Tamekia Thompson, 37, says she is desperate to move from her south London home, as her landlord claims he served her with an eviction notice for failing to pay rent for about seven months A single mum who claims to be living in a rodent-infested house says she lives in fear of her four-year-old autistic son eating mouse poo
Tamekia Thompson, 37, says she is desperate to move from her south London home
The mum-of-two claims rodents eat her food, and the floors and cupboards are strewn with thousands of droppings
Tamekia, a private tenant who moved into the property in 2016 with her two young children, said the house became infested with mice two years ago, MyLondon reports
She said her seven-year-old daughter is incredibly stressed and she is terrified her four-year-old autistic son who will eat anything will ingest the droppings and get sick
Tamekia's landlord claims he has put in measures to address the infestation
Christian Mantey told MyLondon he has a contract with a pest control company, who have laid traps in the house and have agreed to visit every two weeks to dispose of dead mice and fill in holes
He added that the process is taking longer than usual because pest control cannot put poison down over safety concerns with Tamekia's son
He also explained that the tenant is aware of this
Mr Mantey said he has now issued a Section 8 eviction notice to Tamekia, who has not paid her rent for around seven months
He said: I've given [Tamekia] her Section 8 notice telling her to leave because she's in arrears of £3,600
In terms of the rodent issue in the house, there's been pest control that has come to the property, I think about a month ago while she was there
They set up all the traps and all the other equipment they needed in front of her
She said they can't put certain traps around because of the kids, so they adjusted the traps according to how she wanted it
They come every two weeks, I've got a contract with them that they will come every two or three weeks to pick up the dead mice or whatever they find, and to fill up the holes
He added: I'm doing what I've got to do, the pest control is doing what they've got to do, you can't eradicate these things straight away
Tamekia claims she is withholding the rent due to problems with the house, including the rodent infestation
She said that she left her job in August to care for her son full time and is now dependent on Universal Credit from Croydon Council to pay her rent, which she says she hasn't paid due to the mouse infestation
Tamekia says she was told by a pest control worker that, because of the severity of the infection, it would be tricky to get rid of them
Tamekia also said the house also has severe issues with damp on one of the walls
However, Mr Mantey claims Tamekia has never told him that her failure to pay rent is due to her problems with the house, or the mouse infestation
Mr Mantey also claims he has had someone fix the damp in the house two years ago and Tamekia didn't complain again until two weeks ago
He said he has recently been contacted by Croydon Council about the house, who he said have given him 60 days to get 'specific' jobs done in the house, including fixing the damp and repairing the windows
He said: There are people coming to do the whole property.  I'm sorting it
Speaking about the mouse infestation, he added: Getting rid of any infestation takes whatever it's going to take
Tamekia, who is currently on a housing waiting list with Croydon Council, moved into the house to support her sister, who had access to the property under the Shared Lives scheme through the council
The former care worker said: My kids are scared, screaming, crying, they don't want to sleep in the room
My daughter said to me 'mummy I'm stressed'. .
and it really broke my heart
I can tell she's frustrated
She said: [My son] will eat anything, you have to be watching him
Tamekia said her family gets sick a lot: My kids they are vomiting and stuff like that. .
every minute we are catching colds. .
it's just hard work for me to be cleaning [mouse] poo every day. .
The council confirmed Tamekia is on a housing waiting list but have advised her to seek alternative accommodation due to a housing shortage
Steve Reed, MP for Croydon North, also raised the issue with the council in September, but contacted Tamekia on November 22 to say he was yet to receive a response
A Croydon Council spokesperson told MyLondon that they have advised Tamekia on her current private arrangement with her landlord
They say they have advised her to seek alternative accommodation through the private rented or social housing sector, as there is a housing shortage
A council spokesperson said: Although this is not a council property, we have provided Ms Thompson with advice and support around her housing options in both the private rented sector and social housing
We have also been in contact with her landlord about repairs to his property
Get email updates with the day's biggest stories Tamekia Thompson, 37, says she is desperate to move from her south London home, as her landlord claims he served her with an eviction notice for failing to pay rent for about seven months A single mum who claims to be living in a rodent-infested house says she lives in fear of her four-year-old autistic son eating mouse poo
Tamekia Thompson, 37, says she is desperate to move from her south London home
The mum-of-two claims rodents eat her food, and the floors and cupboards are strewn with thousands of droppings
Tamekia, a private tenant who moved into the property in 2016 with her two young children, said the house became infested with mice two years ago, MyLondon reports
She said her seven-year-old daughter is incredibly stressed and she is terrified her four-year-old autistic son who will eat anything will ingest the droppings and get sick
Tamekia's landlord claims he has put in measures to address the infestation
Christian Mantey told MyLondon he has a contract with a pest control company, who have laid traps in the house and have agreed to visit every two weeks to dispose of dead mice and fill in holes
He added that the process is taking longer than usual because pest control cannot put poison down over safety concerns with Tamekia's son
He also explained that the tenant is aware of this
Mr Mantey said he has now issued a Section 8 eviction notice to Tamekia, who has not paid her rent for around seven months
He said: I've given [Tamekia] her Section 8 notice telling her to leave because she's in arrears of £3,600
In terms of the rodent issue in the house, there's been pest control that has come to the property, I think about a month ago while she was there
They set up all the traps and all the other equipment they needed in front of her
She said they can't put certain traps around because of the kids, so they adjusted the traps according to how she wanted it

Friends of Mehlika Derici watched in horror as her boyfriend clasped his arms round her waist and flung himself from the cliff in Turkey, dragging her with him to their deaths The chilling final words of a jealous boyfriend who threw himself off a cliff, dragging his beautiful girlfriend with him have been revealed by horrified witnesses
Police are investigating the suspected murder-suicide after the couple fell 82ft to their deaths, in Marmara Ereglisi, Tekirdag Province, Turkey, on August 6
Landowner, Selcuk Cetiner, 41, and beautician Mehlika Derici, 35, had been enjoying a meal with another couple to celebrate their friend's birthday, just hours before the tragic incident
After the meal the pair had gone with the other couple to a nearby lookout point known as Asiklar Tepesi, or Lovers' Hill
But a row broke out between them and Cetiner pushed Mehlika to the ground before friend, Merve Y, 32, and her boyfriend, Arda Tolunay Y, 26, picked her back up
Merve and her boyfriend Arda claim they heard Cetiner then shout if we die, we die together as clasped his arms round Mehlika's waist and dragged her over the edge, before she had time to react
Paramedics were called to the scene but were only able to declare them dead
The group had been drinking in the restaurant and had carried on at the viewpoint
The couple's bodies were taken to the morgue at Marmara Ereglisi Public Hospital, while police seized their mobile phones for analysis
Some local reports said Mehlika was mother to two children
Femicide is a growing problem in Turkey, particularly after the country officially quit the Istanbul Convention in July last year
According to the 2021 Annual Data Report by the 'We Will Stop Femicide Platform', 280 women were killed by men in 2021, while 217 women were found suspiciously dead
According to data from the 'Monument Counter' - a digital memorial for women killed by violence that is updated daily - 246 femicides have taken place in Turkey so far this year

Oliver Harta's parents Nik and Sheryl, provided evidence of his learning difficulties and proof of a specialist bus he uses to go on his work experience run by the authority An autistic man has been stripped of his free travel pass in a move that his mum has slammed as 'absolute nonsense'
Oliver Harta has been told he no longer qualifies for a 'Freedom Pass' which allows him to travel across London for free
His family are desperately trying to fight for it to be reinstated after being told it would be revoked
The 20-year-old from Harrow, north west London, was told the news despite being given the pass which was valid until 2026
A letter from Harrow Council said Oliver's disability meant he was no longer qualified for it
Oliver's parents Nik and Sheryl, provided evidence of his learning difficulties and proof of a specialist bus he uses to go on his work experience, which is run by the authority
Sheryl said the council is insisting that she provides a letter from the NHS which explicitly outlines Oliver’s condition
She told MyLondon the council was making things more difficult for her family
Sheryl said: My son is almost 21 and he’s studying entry level maths and English
He doesn’t have any GCSEs, he attends a specialist college
It’s quite obvious that his autism impairs his social interaction
I really don’t understand it and it’s quite upsetting for us
How can the council just move the goalposts and say ‘having autism isn’t enough’ anymore? She explained how she told Oliver that he might have to use a bank card to travel on the bus, which he was confused about as it was a break from his regular routine
Sheryl said: It caused quite a stir and got him into a bit of a fluster as it’s something he’s not used to
He just kept asking ‘why?’ and saying ‘I’ve never had to do that before’
Sheryl has been in contact with the council, who put her in touch with a private company that manages the Freedom Pass applications in Harrow
She said the people making these decisions are not aware of the specific circumstances that affect each applicant and she thinks they are using a one size fits all checklist
She added: I’ve submitted loads of information, including his education and health care plan but they don’t want to know
They say we’ve got to have this specific piece of paper and getting hold of that could take up to a year - it’s wasting precious time.  It’s an absolute nonsense
Sheryl said the council is making things more difficult for her family in a situation where, if anything, they should be given more support
She said: It’s really obstructive
It’s not the easiest thing having a child with learning difficulties and then we have to go through things like this
Oliver can’t travel on his own so we have to pay to go with him
Now they’re asking us to pay on top of that
When you go to the cinema, they accept a carer card so somebody can go with him for free
I don’t know what’s different with Harrow Council
Harrow Council explained guidelines are set by the independent assessor, which determines who is eligible for a Freedom Pass based on types of disability
A council spokesperson said: We cannot comment on individual cases
Concessions are reviewed every three years to ensure the applicant continues to meet the criteria
As per the national guidelines, we can only go by what we are sent by the independent assessor
Applicants have a right to appeal this decision

On October 27, 2021, George was working at a property on Old Road in Cheadle adjacent to the railway lines
The apprentice builder was said to be visibly upset before taking a break - a short time later he stepped in front of a train A 'beautiful' teenager told his friends thank you for being the top lads you are in a final voice message moments before he took his own life, an inquest heard
George Thompson, 18, had been battling mental health problems and lows he described as ‘thunderstorms’ before his death
His dad, Dave Thompson, described George's death as the ‘hardest thunderstorm yet’
On October 27, 2021, George was working at a property on in Cheadle
The apprentice builder was said to be visibly upset before taking a break - a short time later he was hit by a train
He answered a call from his friend, Alex Mills, who urged him to step away and tried to tell him how much he had going for him
Unfortunately, George did not respond to these pleas
He was a wonderful young lad, his father told an inquest at the Coroner’s Court in Stockport
He was so caring and would do anything for anyone
He really loved helping people and he got a lot from that
He was everything you would want as a parent
He loved us and we loved him.  He was just everything
He was funny, so funny
At the drop of a hat he could just have us laughing
George was the most beautiful, caring, intelligent, reliable, funny, loyal, handsome, courteous, polite, son and brother a parent could ever wish for
There was so much to come but we shall have to treasure the memories we have.  But they’re not enough.  We wanted more
Mr Thompson explained that George's good moments far outweighed the bad, reports the Manchester Evening News
The lifelong Stockport County fan had often struggled with his mental health and previously tried to take his own life on September 15 but had misjudged when it was coming and was taken into hospital
He told the mental health team at Stepping Hill Hospital he was ‘gutted’ by what had happened
During the inquest, Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust were subjected to criticism from George's family, who could not believe the teen was assessed as low risk by the mental health team despite being considered a higher risk just three hours prior
The GP was shocked when I told him George was allowed home, Dave Thompson said
I can’t get away from the fact that three hours before he was classed as high risk but when he was in the room with Ms Dunne (conducting the mental health assessment) he was deemed low risk
There was almost no common sense thinking allowed and they have to stick to this criteria.  Everything seems so rigid
On a number of occasions throughout the inquest, Mr Thompson and his son Will both stated something needs to change
After George's death the trust conducted an investigation, which they say is a standard procedure when someone known to mental health services dies
No actions were put in place by Pennine Care as a result of the report but the trust says they listened to the family's concerns and staff have taken them on board
According to his therapist Mike Andrews, George was making progress in his battle with the ‘thunderclouds’ in his mind and was really engaged with his sessions as well as those he had with Karen Taylor of Healthy Minds
Both clinical professionals spoke highly of George and his determination to heal himself, but these ‘thunderclouds got the better of him in the end’, Mr Andrews said
After coming to a conclusion of suicide, assistant coroner Anna Morris said: It is hard not to have been moved by how much he was loved by all who knew him
George’s mum Caroline, dad David, and brother Will thanked all those who have supported them through this time including Stockport County football club, those assisting the coronal investigation and everyone who has shared wonderful stories of George

Leyla Gallagher, 10, from Leeds, craves friendship and loves people, but her autism, ADHD and Pathological Demand Avoidance (PDA) make social interactions and everyday expectations difficult for her A ten-year-old girl has been rejected by every school she has applied for, leaving her desperate for friendship and feeling different, her mum has said
Daniella Gallagher, 39 has said her daughter Leyla is big and bold and should not be hindered by the conditions that affect her
Leyla has autism, ADHD and Pathological Demand Avoidance (PDA) which makes social interactions and everyday expectations difficult for her
She has been out of school since June 2021, with local mainstream schools in Leeds finding it difficult to place her, Leeds Live reports
Daniella said : It's been hell for Leyla.  She's socially isolated
A lot of Autistic people have special interests - Leyla's special interest is people.  She's desperate for friendships
She's a 10-year-old girl that is full of life, energy
She's big and bold, has a great sense of humour, and is a fantastic character
She's desperate for friends but she can't maintain friendships well because she's not in a school environment where she can meet and see friends regularly
Leyla is of an age now where she's aware she's different and obviously that has a huge impact on her and her self-esteem
She hasn't identified how she fits in yet and who she is as a person and tried to copy other people
It's such a difficult time for her and she isn't in a school environment where she can work out who she is
Leyla was previously in mainstream education but began to struggle from around year one onwards
In 2019, she was diagnosed with Autism and ADHD, and Daniella started looking at alternative provisions Leyla could attend
She found her a place at a partnership school with an attached provision to start in January 2020
In December 2020, Leyla had PDA traits added to her diagnosis by CAMHS
Leyla's time at the alternative provision started off well, but she was affected by lockdowns, and quickly became anxious as before
In June 2021, the school admitted it couldn't meet her needs
Daniella said: Mainstream schools just looked at her as 'that naughty child'
While she was in mainstream schooling she was locked in classrooms when she was having meltdowns before she was diagnosed, Daniella said
She was running out of school with no shoes on onto main roads when she just seven years old
Getting her into school was a nightmare
The anxiety was so high, I'd have to peel her off railings
If I was successful I'd get a phone call within half an hour that she'd run out or had a meltdown
Even once she joined her new specialist provision in 2020, her anxiety got to the point of being through the roof - at that point, it was just impossible
She was trying to escape and abscond all the time
Since then, Leyla has been at home and out of full-time education while Daniella has desperately been trying to find somewhere that can accommodate Leyla
In the time since the summer, both Leeds City Council and Daniella have been contacting provisions across Leeds to see if they can fulfil her needs as per her Education, Health and Care Plan (EHC)
EHCs set out the specific needs of children with special educational needs in order to provide the support those children need
But so far, every single provision has said no - Daniella estimates Leyla has been rejected by 10-12 schools in the local authority area
One primary school said it could potentially meet Leyla's needs - but it has no space until 2023, by which point she will nearly have aged out of primary education
Daniella added: Leyla doesn't get the chance to experience lots of different peer groups and social interactions
We try to do lots of different activities, climbing, swimming, and more but she ends up stuck with me all the time
She's run away before, she's been bullied, she's been hit by people claiming to be her friends, she gets horrible messages
She's quite an intense person who doesn't really understand social boundaries all the time and that can make her very vulnerable for being bullied
It's really hard for her
According to Daniella, the reason Leyla has been refused many alternative provisions is that she is often too academic to fit in with the peer groups
Daniella also said she has had a nightmare trying to get hold of someone to speak to at the local authority since autumn 2021 to discuss suitable schools
She has since made an official complaint
The school Leyla was at until June 2021 have helped sort out a six to 12-week placement at a provision at another school in the area
But the provision isn't permanent as a solution.  It's heartbreaking for me
She's my baby and I want her to be happy
I know she will be amazing at whatever she does when she finds herself, Daniella said
She's a very strong, resilient, creative young girl and she's going to do amazing
Leyla changes and educates people all around her because she's that type of character
She will do amazing once she finds the place she fits in
It's hard to watch your child struggle so much
The gaps in her learning are just growing and growing and that's becoming more apparent as she gets older
I do worry about her future but I will help her do whatever she needs to do to get her GCSEs, whether she wants to do them later in life
My expectations for her currently are more around focusing on her social and emotional wellbeing
She added she was saddened by the fact that there are no options for children like her daughter
Daniella said: I can't make a school happen by clicking my fingers - there just seems to be nowhere out there for children like Leyla with PDA
There's very little knowledge in this area around the condition
We're lucky to have really good support groups in the area as there's also very little official support
I'm a single mum with two kids and they take up every second of my life
That can impact my own mental health - it's not easy
I used to work at a school but I had to leave my job because of all this
You don't realise until you're in this situation how dire it is
Even just trying to get a bit of help and support from anybody is impossible
A Leeds City Council spokesperson said: Whilst we are not able to comment on individual cases, the local authority is committed to work in partnership with parents and in the best interests of children
We strive to meet the provision needs of children with SEND and aspirations of parents and we take the concerns of parents seriously
PDA is a clinical diagnosis and therefore we are led by our clinical partners in their use of diagnostic terminology
Our statutory processes, consultation with specialist and mainstream settings and provision offer is not restricted by a diagnostic framework
We endeavour to work restoratively with all families to ensure children with SEND meet their aspirations and outcomes

Leyla is of an age now where she's aware she's different and obviously that has a huge impact on her and her self-esteem
She hasn't identified how she fits in yet and who she is as a person and tried to copy other people
It's such a difficult time for her and she isn't in a school environment where she can work out who she is
Leyla was previously in mainstream education but began to struggle from around year one onwards
In 2019, she was diagnosed with Autism and ADHD, and Daniella started looking at alternative provisions Leyla could attend
She found her a place at a partnership school with an attached provision to start in January 2020
In December 2020, Leyla had PDA traits added to her diagnosis by CAMHS
Leyla's time at the alternative provision started off well, but she was affected by lockdowns, and quickly became anxious as before
In June 2021, the school admitted it couldn't meet her needs
Daniella said: Mainstream schools just looked at her as 'that naughty child'
While she was in mainstream schooling she was locked in classrooms when she was having meltdowns before she was diagnosed, Daniella said
She was running out of school with no shoes on onto main roads when she just seven years old
Getting her into school was a nightmare
The anxiety was so high, I'd have to peel her off railings
If I was successful I'd get a phone call within half an hour that she'd run out or had a meltdown
Even once she joined her new specialist provision in 2020, her anxiety got to the point of being through the roof - at that point, it was just impossible
She was trying to escape and abscond all the time
Since then, Leyla has been at home and out of full-time education while Daniella has desperately been trying to find somewhere that can accommodate Leyla
In the time since the summer, both Leeds City Council and Daniella have been contacting provisions across Leeds to see if they can fulfil her needs as per her Education, Health and Care Plan (EHC)
EHCs set out the specific needs of children with special educational needs in order to provide the support those children need
But so far, every single provision has said no - Daniella estimates Leyla has been rejected by 10-12 schools in the local authority area
One primary school said it could potentially meet Leyla's needs - but it has no space until 2023, by which point she will nearly have aged out of primary education
Daniella added: Leyla doesn't get the chance to experience lots of different peer groups and social interactions
We try to do lots of different activities, climbing, swimming, and more but she ends up stuck with me all the time
She's run away before, she's been bullied, she's been hit by people claiming to be her friends, she gets horrible messages
She's quite an intense person who doesn't really understand social boundaries all the time and that can make her very vulnerable for being bullied
It's really hard for her
According to Daniella, the reason Leyla has been refused many alternative provisions is that she is often too academic to fit in with the peer groups
Daniella also said she has had a nightmare trying to get hold of someone to speak to at the local authority since autumn 2021 to discuss suitable schools
She has since made an official complaint
The school Leyla was at until June 2021 have helped sort out a six to 12-week placement at a provision at another school in the area
But the provision isn't permanent as a solution.  It's heartbreaking for me
She's my baby and I want her to be happy
I know she will be amazing at whatever she does when she finds herself, Daniella said
She's a very strong, resilient, creative young girl and she's going to do amazing
Leyla changes and educates people all around her because she's that type of character
She will do amazing once she finds the place she fits in
It's hard to watch your child struggle so much
The gaps in her learning are just growing and growing and that's becoming more apparent as she gets older
I do worry about her future but I will help her do whatever she needs to do to get her GCSEs, whether she wants to do them later in life
My expectations for her currently are more around focusing on her social and emotional wellbeing
She added she was saddened by the fact that there are no options for children like her daughter
Daniella said: I can't make a school happen by clicking my fingers - there just seems to be nowhere out there for children like Leyla with PDA
There's very little knowledge in this area around the condition
We're lucky to have really good support groups in the area as there's also very little official support
I'm a single mum with two kids and they take up every second of my life
That can impact my own mental health - it's not easy
I used to work at a school but I had to leave my job because of all this
You don't realise until you're in this situation how dire it is
Even just trying to get a bit of help and support from anybody is impossible
A Leeds City Council spokesperson said: Whilst we are not able to comment on individual cases, the local authority is committed to work in partnership with parents and in the best interests of children
We strive to meet the provision needs of children with SEND and aspirations of parents and we take the concerns of parents seriously
PDA is a clinical diagnosis and therefore we are led by our clinical partners in their use of diagnostic terminology
Our statutory processes, consultation with specialist and mainstream settings and provision offer is not restricted by a diagnostic framework
We endeavour to work restoratively with all families to ensure children with SEND meet their aspirations and outcomes

Richard Farquhar, 61 - who murdered his wife in a jealous rage over an affair - took his own life after his release from prison was stalled and he was suspended from his charity shop job A murderer who killed his wife after discovering she was having an affair later took his own life in jail
Richard Farquhar became depressed about the possibility of delaying his release and after losing his prison placement at a charity shop
The 61-year-old was being held in HMP Greenock, in Inverclyde, Scotland, and, nearing the end of his sentence, had been moved to less restrictive procedures, including being given the new job
But he was suspended after his placement supervisor began to feel increasingly uncomfortable, according to a sheriff's report
Farquhar's mental health started to deteriorate after prison chiefs stopped moves to prepare him for release
A fatal accident inquiry was held virtually at the town’s sheriff court, with submissions made in February
Sheriff Andrew McIntyre issued a judgement in relation to the inmate's death on March 14, 2019
The determination was published earlier this month
Mr McIntyre said Farquhar died at 1am at Inverclyde Royal Hospital as a result of an injury sustained within a cell between 3
30pm and 4pm on March 13
Mr Farquhar’s death did not result from an accident, he added
The killer was sentenced to life with a minimum of 12 years for the murder of wife Anne in 2008 on the A90 road near Aberdeen, Scotland
The High Court in Edinburgh heard how she had kicked him out of their home in Cove Bay, Aberdeenshire, after she discovered he was having an affair with her friend
Anne then began seeing the same woman's husband and Farquhar stabbed her to death
Mr McIntyre said officials failed to provide him with detailed plans on what he needed to do to work towards his release or on how to access sessions with a psychologist
He concluded that if these actions had been taken the inmate's death may have been avoided
He said: I have found that Mr Farquhar committed suicide following a decline in his mental health contributed to by his suspension from a community placement
I have found that in the days and weeks prior to his death his imminent risk of suicide could not have been detected
I have also found that, as a result of the systems of working in place within HMP Greenock, and as a result of certain other factors, opportunities to safeguard Mr Farquhar’s mental wellbeing in the period before his death were missed
In particular I have found that: delay, a lack of joined-up working, and insufficient communication with Mr Farquhar, all contributed to him becoming distressed by his lack of progress, and to opportunities to avert that distress being missed
What crimes have been reported in your neighbourhood? Check with In Your Area
I find that those omissions contributed to his death
I find no cause for criticism of any of the professionals involved; it has only been possible to identify how things could have been done differently with the benefit of hindsight
I have made recommendations which I believe, if implemented, might realistically prevent other deaths in similar circumstances
The sheriff recommended several new guidelines for dealing with prisoners before release

Last Thursday, five family members jumped one-by-one of a seventh-floor apartment in Montreux, Switzerland
Police said the family had become steeped in conspiracy and survivalist theories and withdrawn from society Four members of the same family killed themselves in a suspected collective suicide leap from their seventh-floor apartment
A French family jumped one after another from their apartment in the Swiss town of Montreux, local police investigating the tragic mystery said today
They added that the family appeared to be fervent conspiracy theorists, hoarding food in their apartment
Only a 15-year-old boy survived the tragedy that happened last Thursday in the town on Lake Geneva, and he now remains in a coma in a stable condition in hospital
The Vaud regional police announced that their findings make it possible to rule out the intervention of a third party and suggest that all the victims jumped from the balcony one after the other
They are currently working on the theory of a collective suicide, they said
A 40-year-old man, his 41-year-old wife, her twin sister and the couple’s eight-year-old daughter along with the boy, all took the 20 metre jump from their apartment
France's Journal du Dimanche newspaper said the father, Eric David, grew up in a wealthy part of Marseille and even attended one of France’s most prestigious schools, the Ecole Polytechnique
The twin sisters, Nasrine and Narjisse Feraoun, grew up in a family of five children who were all educated at the elite Lycee Henri-IV in Paris
The mother was a dentist and her sister an ophthalmologist and the newspaper also said the twins were granddaughters of Algerian novelist Mouloud Feraoun
Police said that the family were withdrawn from society before their suicide
Two officers knocked on the apartment door at 6:15am local time, asking to speak to the dad about his son’s homeschool arrangement
However, after a voice asked who was at the door, they said nothing more and officers, unable to enter the apartment, left
Then, less than an hour later, just before 7am, all five leapt from the balcony within the space of five minutes
Police could find no evidence of a struggle, seemingly confirming that all of them jumped of their own accord
A step-ladder was also found on the balcony, where they jumped from
Police said: Before or during the events, no witnesses, including the two police officers present on the spot from 6:15 am and the passers-by at the foot of the building, heard the slightest noise or cry coming from the apartment or the balcony
Technical investigations show no warning signs of such an act
They added that since the start of the pandemic, the family had become increasingly interested in conspiracy and survivalist theories
The family lived in almost complete self-sufficiency, cutting off the outside world
They have amassed a stockpile of food, which took up most of their living space
Only the mother’s twin sister worked outside the home, with neither the mum nor eight-year-old registered with local authorities
Police added that the evidence suggested the family feared authorities interfering with their lives

Chris Lam died on April 7 after suffering from with depression since the Hilllsborough disaster in 1989 and had spent his life campaigning tirelessly for justice A daughter has paid tribute to her best friend dad who died at the age of 52 after suffering depression since surviving the Hilllsborough tragedy
Chris Lam died on April 7 this year having spent his life campaigning tirelessly for justice having survived the 1989 Hilllsborough disaster that claimed the lives of 97 people
His daughter Rebecca said he struggled with the tragedy since then
Rebecca told the Liverpool Echo : He was a Hillsborough survivor, he's struggled a lot since then, and always struggled in April in the lead up to the anniversary
She said: We knew he was struggling but we've all said none of us expected he would have done anything like this
Paying tribute to her dad, Rebecca said he was a well known and genuine man, who was part of Widnes Running Club where he was known by the nickname Mr Widnes
Rebecca added: He was genuine, he was full of life, always willing to give a hand to anybody
He was there for anybody to have a chat
He was like my best friend, we just bounced off each other
We kept each other going, he's always been my rock
He was so well known we couldn't go anywhere without him bumping into somebody that he knew
She has now set up a Gofundme page to raise money for the Hillsborough Survivors Support Alliance, who provided counselling to her dad, and Amparo, a charity that offers support to anyone affected by suicide
On the page she says: Chris was a wonderful man who brought happiness wherever he went
He was warm, kind, generous, funny, a sportsman, a supporter, a friend to many, a loved one and a doting father
He was also a massive Liverpool FC supporter and a Hillsborough survivor
He campaigned tirelessly for justice and felt passionately about the work of the HSA
He very sadly ended his own life in April 2022
Amparo have offered invaluable support to his loved ones during this difficult time
We believe that raising money for these two organisations in his name will help leave a positive legacy

WARNING DISTRESSING CONTENT: A mum who plunged to her death searched for the means of taking her own life the day before she did
Raquel Wilkins' death was ruled a murder-suicide A woman who calmly looked her boyfriend in the eye as she fell to her death off a balcony holding their son looked up easy suicide on Google before she died
Raquel Wilkins, 40, was killed with her two-year-old son Denzel Wilkins-Browning when she stepped off a high point of the Petco arena, a baseball stadium in downtown San Diego, California, in the US
The San Diego Police ruled her death on September 29 a murder -suicide after the six-storey fall killed both Raquel and Denzel
The family of Raquel contested the ruling and one witness said that while standing on a bench she again lost her balance and this time, fell over the edge
She had already been seen on the bench and nearly losing her balance
They added: From my vantage point, looking at her back, it was almost like she rolled over the railing
Her sudden decision to fall seemed odd as the pair were seen happy and laughing on the day and the family's attorney claimed the ruling was useful for the owners of the stadium, as reported by the San Diego Tribune
He claimed: The city of San Diego owns that ballpark, it is legally responsible, assuming that what caused her to fall was anything but her intent
The only way the city is not at fault is if she intended to kill herself and her baby
Lieutenant Andra Brown said the police had come to the murder-suicide conclusion after detectives conducted a thorough and comprehensive investigation that included dozens of interviews, reviewing of available video footage, and collecting background information to determine what led to the deaths
The boyfriend of Raquel contests the idea that her death was an accident and said it was very intentional, very planned
Christopher Browning said she all of a sudden stared straight at him with an eerie silence, like in a movie
It was so quick, so fast, he added to the New York Post
Both of them went over.  It was very quiet
I was in complete shock
Another witness backed up Christopher's claims in a police report and argued the act was completely intentional
Her demeanour walking up was so calm
She didn’t even look down
It looked just like she was trying to hop over a fence
Raquel's mental state in the months leading up to her death had reportedly deteriorated and had broken down in front of her boyfriend before
She had searched for tips for taking her own life on her phone the day before
To grieve in a healthy way, you have to honour the truth, Christopher said

Tracey Ham claimed half of her son Zachary's 13th birthday at Thorpe Park was wasted on the bumper cars before staff finally gave them a fast track pass so they could skip the queues A mum says her autistic son's birthday was ruined after he was refused an access pass to Thorpe Park - and claims it's because he's not disabled enough
Tracy Ham, 41, receives the Disability Living Allowance as her 13-year-old son Zachary Relfe is autistic, MyLondon reported
On previous visits to the theme park the pair were given a Ride Access Pass by just showing proof of disability to staff as Zachary finds it hard to queue
However, mum Tracey claims a new policy means her son is considered not disabled enough to receive the pass
She arrived at the park on Saturday May 28 at 10
15am and was told by officials she needed to fill in a form online with seven days notice
The mum from Paddock Wood said she did not know about the change but Thorpe Park claim the Ride Access Pass was made available online to Tracey before her visit date
She filled out their application but as Zachary only gets middle-rate care - not the high-rate required - he was not eligible
However, the Ride Access Passes is guided by external regulatory bodies who determine whether someone is classed as lower rate, middle rate or higher rate, as this classification is not set by Thorpe Park and they have no input
The mum and son then spent the next four hours walking around the park with Zachary unable to manage long queues
He decided to ride the bumper cars five times instead
Tracy said: I was raging
I was just really angry that my money and time had been wasted, and disappointed his birthday had been ruined
He looks forward to his trip to Thorpe Park every year
Tracy added: The person who gets the rage off the child is the mother, he could not go on the things he wanted to go on
It was just a waste of time
If I had known I would not have gone there
She returned to customer services again and battled the dodgy WiFi to fill out the form again with Tracey estimating she spent an hour of the day just filling in forms
After it was rejected again, a member of staff decided to issue her with fast track tickets as a gesture of goodwill, allowing her to skip queues as she had hoped to in the morning
Despite being eventually issued the instant access tickets, Tracy said it was still a shame the day was wasted
She added: Because of the way my son is we do not go out that often, which made it harder again
There's a lot of people who go with disabled children so I imagine it's affected a lot of people

A spokesperson for Thorpe Park told the Mirror: As part of our ongoing focus on providing the best possible experience for our guests when visiting our UK theme parks, we have listened to guest feedback and have moved to an advanced registration for our Ride Access Pass
Documentation is requested to ensure the Ride Access Pass remains effective for guests who need it, and by doing this in advance the process is more efficient for all
There have not been any changes to the criteria or the documentation for Ride Access Passes that we accept this season
The only change is the simplification of the process by centralising it and moving it online, rather than at the attraction, so guests can simply apply online ahead of their visit
We are committed to listening, learning and adapting to the needs of our guests, and welcome the opportunity to discuss guest experiences to help us create the best experiences possible for the future

Lindsey Bridges says daughter Lauren was failed by the mental health system, saying it 'robbed her of her daughter, her son of a sister and her parents of their granddaughter' A broken mum has paid tribute to her beautiful and brave autistic daughter who took her own life after spending eight months in a locked psychiatric unit six hours from her family home
Lindsey Bridges, 43, believes her daughter, Lauren, 20, was failed by the mental health system after spending four years locked in six different psychiatric units
Lindsey said: Being an inpatient has robbed me of my daughter, my son of his sister, my parents of their granddaughter and most importantly it has taken away Lauren’s life
I’ve absolutely broken because of this, I’m lost without her
When she went went into hospital I made a promise to her
I promised I’d never give up fighting for her, no matter what
We often spoke about how we would change the world once she was well enough to help me
She hated the system and how it was failing everyone around her
Lindsey says the NHS Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) and adult mental health teams failed to provide appropriate community support for her daughter who was struggling with day to day life and her grief after the death of her younger brother when she was eight-years-old
Lindsey, an integrated urgent care health advisor and hair extensionist, from Bournemouth said: Lauren first asked for help dealing with her mental health when she was 14 and when no support came her struggle escalated
She had severe anxiety and OCD
She also had Asperger’s but wasn’t diagnosed until she was 17
The opportunity for early intervention was missed for Lauren
If there was more support available when we first asked for it I believe things would never have got so bad
Lauren has had to put up with a lot in her short life
When she was just eight years old, her little brother, Alfie died from Mitochondrial disease, she watched him suffer for two and a half years
Her OCD rituals were often about protecting her family
Lauren first went into a psychiatric unit voluntarily on 31 Oct 2018 to receive therapy
But her mum says after a few weeks no therapy materialised and without a plan in place Lauren became very frustrated, felt trapped and her self-harming got progressively worse
Lindsey said: She would self harm while she was being watched by the healthcare professionals, much more than we could ever have imagined and more severe than we had seen before
Lauren was missing her family so much and got worse simply by being in hospital and not having any treatment
From October 2018 to February 2022 Lauren was an inpatient at six facilities
Lindsey said: For years she has been locked away, often not seeing daylight or offered exercise for weeks on end, with no plan to meet her needs psychiatrically
And little or no therapy or therapeutic activities to stimulate her
It was a battle to make sure her basic human rights were being met on a daily basis
On occasions, due to Lauren’s frustration of the system and being locked away 24/7 she has been sent to an adult unit and put in total seclusion without even a bed, just a ground sheet to sleep on
She deserved the best and sadly was ripped away from her family time and time again and placed in settings that were like torture for her
She’s been treated worse than a criminal at times
All we wanted was the correct care and treatment package to allow her to come home for good, with me, where she belongs instead we had to make do with short contact visits and two video calls a day
Lindsey says Lauren was a straight A student who aspired to be a doctor or a paediatric nurse
She added: Lauren and I were exceptionally close
Our bond was absolutely unbreakable
We were massively failed by the mental health system
Right now over 2000 people with a Learning Disability and/or Autism remain locked in inpatient units
Often they are far from family and at an increased risk of abuse
Lauren was one of these people
Together we have been fighting for the correct care and treatment package but sadly it didn’t come quick enough
After being detained under the mental health act and sent to a unit six hours away in Manchester in June last year Lauren’s mental health declined rapidly
She suffered terribly from separation anxiety and hated being so far away from me
It broke her and our little family
She wasn’t just my daughter, she was my best friend
She passed away on Thursday 24th February after her heart stopped beating for well over an hour
Doctors kept her alive until 11
32am on 26th February 2022 to see if she could be a suitable organ donor
Now she has gone to join her baby brother Alfie in Heaven but she leaves behind her other brother Bobby, her Grandparents, her dad, James, uncles and aunties, godparents, special friends, girlfriend and her very special cousins
Her beautiful smile, kind heart and pure courage and strength touched the hearts of everyone who met her
In memory of Lauren, Lindsey is proposing the introduction of some changes to significantly enhance the lives of vulnerable children and young adults who are being detained under the mental health act
Lindsey's petition has attracted over 5000 signatures already
Lindsey said: No children or adults with autism should be detained under the mental health act or sent to psychiatric hospitals out of area, far away from home
No child or adult should be left in an unsuitable hospital setting that is detrimental for their well-being
Lauren was left alone, far from home, in an environment that was causing more harm than good
I believe if my proposals were already in place, my daughter would still be alive
We would like to express our sincere condolences to Lauren’s family and friends at this difficult time
A Dorset HealthCare spokesperson said: While we cannot comment on individual circumstances, we can say that we do endeavour to support all patients who are being cared for by our mental health services and in the community so they can lead safe and fulfilling lives
Where patients or their families feel they have not received the support they expect we work with them and do our best to address their concerns Out-of-area placements are always used only as a last resort by services, either when we are at full capacity or when a person has very complex needs and requires specialist care not available within Dorset
We have always been committed to reducing the need for out-of-area placements, in line with the NHS Long Term Plan, and over the past few years we have undertaken an extensive programme of work to achieve this

On October 27, 2021, George was working at a property on Old Road in Cheadle adjacent to the railway lines
The apprentice builder was said to be visibly upset before taking a break - a short time later he stepped in front of a train A 'beautiful' teenager told his friends thank you for being the top lads you are in a final voice message moments before he took his own life, an inquest heard
George Thompson, 18, had been battling mental health problems and lows he described as ‘thunderstorms’ before his death
His dad, Dave Thompson, described George's death as the ‘hardest thunderstorm yet’
On October 27, 2021, George was working at a property on in Cheadle
The apprentice builder was said to be visibly upset before taking a break - a short time later he was hit by a train
He answered a call from his friend, Alex Mills, who urged him to step away and tried to tell him how much he had going for him
Unfortunately, George did not respond to these pleas
He was a wonderful young lad, his father told an inquest at the Coroner’s Court in Stockport
He was so caring and would do anything for anyone
He really loved helping people and he got a lot from that
He was everything you would want as a parent
He loved us and we loved him.  He was just everything
He was funny, so funny
At the drop of a hat he could just have us laughing
George was the most beautiful, caring, intelligent, reliable, funny, loyal, handsome, courteous, polite, son and brother a parent could ever wish for
There was so much to come but we shall have to treasure the memories we have.  But they’re not enough.  We wanted more
Mr Thompson explained that George's good moments far outweighed the bad, reports the Manchester Evening News
The lifelong Stockport County fan had often struggled with his mental health and previously tried to take his own life on September 15 but had misjudged when it was coming and was taken into hospital
He told the mental health team at Stepping Hill Hospital he was ‘gutted’ by what had happened
During the inquest, Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust were subjected to criticism from George's family, who could not believe the teen was assessed as low risk by the mental health team despite being considered a higher risk just three hours prior
The GP was shocked when I told him George was allowed home, Dave Thompson said
I can’t get away from the fact that three hours before he was classed as high risk but when he was in the room with Ms Dunne (conducting the mental health assessment) he was deemed low risk
There was almost no common sense thinking allowed and they have to stick to this criteria.  Everything seems so rigid
On a number of occasions throughout the inquest, Mr Thompson and his son Will both stated something needs to change
After George's death the trust conducted an investigation, which they say is a standard procedure when someone known to mental health services dies
No actions were put in place by Pennine Care as a result of the report but the trust says they listened to the family's concerns and staff have taken them on board
According to his therapist Mike Andrews, George was making progress in his battle with the ‘thunderclouds’ in his mind and was really engaged with his sessions as well as those he had with Karen Taylor of Healthy Minds
Both clinical professionals spoke highly of George and his determination to heal himself, but these ‘thunderclouds got the better of him in the end’, Mr Andrews said
After coming to a conclusion of suicide, assistant coroner Anna Morris said: It is hard not to have been moved by how much he was loved by all who knew him
George’s mum Caroline, dad David, and brother Will thanked all those who have supported them through this time including Stockport County football club, those assisting the coronal investigation and everyone who has shared wonderful stories of George

Jade Roberts, 26, took her own life just hours after taking a video laughing and playing with her kids in the garden and was described as a woman with a 'heart of gold' A young mum was found dead just hours after laughing with her children in the garden as she faced a hidden battle behind her brave facade
Jade Roberts, 26, from Liverpool, has been described as a woman who would do anything for anyone and had a heart of gold, but was suffering with anxiety and depression underneath her smiles
Now, her heartbroken mum Tracey says she is dedicated to ending the stigma over the silent killer, and said she had two choices when her beautiful daughter died suddenly and just hours after she was captured on video laughing with her children
Tracey described her daughter as an unbelievable mum as every minute of the day was dedicated to her children, but she never realised the true extent of what her daughter was going through behind the scenes
As Tracey herself spiralled deeper into a depression after Jade took her own life in April last year, she told the ECHO she could either spiral further and give up or make a positive change and help others
With the help of her loved ones, the trained psychotherapist began the process of setting up a project in her daughter's name
The Jade Roberts Project will soon be opening its building at Merseyside's 109 Rocky Lane which will help them provide workshops on anxiety, depression, suicide prevention and coping techniques as well as providing a counselling service
Those in suicidal crisis can access the project through a referral
After losing Jade to suicide last year, I've never experienced depression like it, said Tracey
I was stuck in my bedroom, crying all the time, no motivation
I was suffering PTSD, I wasn't sleeping
My daughter had to basically look after me
I have a lot of resilience and I had two choices
I could either go further and give up, but I went with the other choice, to help
I don't want anyone to go through the pain that myself and my family have gone through
The pain will never go away, I'm just learning to live with it
With the hope of ending the stigma and spreading the message that it's okay to not be okay, the family say it feels like Jade is still here as they create a legacy in her memory and for her children
Tracey added: After that I lived in the library, I did a lot of research
There's no help out there for people
I thought I have to change this
I truly believe everything I've learnt about the signs, all the knowledge I now have, Jade would still be here
A fundraising page was set up last year to kickstart the charity with the money going towards the renting of the building so people can attend when they are referred, as well as allowing the volunteers to get the relevant training
But more needs to be raised to ensure the help can continue, and more training can be undertaken to help save lives
The fundraiser, which will go towards training such as ASIST (Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training), can be found here
More information about ASIST can be found by clicking here
If you are affected by this story there are many people who would be happy to talk to you: Samaritans If you need to talk and don't know where to turn to, the Samaritans operate a free helpline open 24/7 on 116 123

Mind The mental health charity Mind has resources aimed at helping you cope with and plan for a crisis
Visit their website for details on helplines, how to access crisis services and what to do if you're unable to get help yourself
*In an emergency, dial 999 for urgent help Tracey added: The more people trained in ASIST the more lives can be saved, but it's over £100 per person
There's a five-day course in October that's £3,000 each but I truly believe with these skills, we can reach out to more
With the hopes of an open day on October 1 and the official launch of the project on October 3, Tracey is reaching out for more volunteers who are willing to help as well as support workers and counsellors
Those that are can email enquiries@thejaderobertsproject. co. uk
As well as a 10-week project focusing on mental health and a counselling service, Tracey has high hopes for the future in the form of a befriending service, yoga classes, walks in the park and hiring a minibus for days out
A billboard outside of their building will also spread the message that it's okay to not be okay
She said: Suicide is a silent killer, you can't see what's going on in someone's head
You can see a black eye or a broken leg and breaking that stigma, to me, is about more people coming forward and talking about how they are really feeling
It's about making people feel listened to and giving them hope
See what’s happening near you by entering your postcode below or visit InYourArea After Jade's death, tributes came pouring in for her, with the devoted mum described as a caring and compassionate woman
Having this charity in her name is an honour, her family said, with Tracey adding: It isn't just a random project, it's emotional because of what it stands for
But it's in honour of my beautiful daughter to help people and save lives and while I'm doing this, it's like she's still here, her name is being mentioned all the time
In the hope of spreading awareness and raising further funds towards the project, Jade's siblings Danni and Jake will be bravely taking to the skies on September 24 at 2pm for a skydive
Having already raised over £1,000, the fundraiser can be found by clicking here

You can see a black eye or a broken leg and breaking that stigma, to me, is about more people coming forward and talking about how they are really feeling
It's about making people feel listened to and giving them hope

Having this charity in her name is an honour, her family said, with Tracey adding: It isn't just a random project, it's emotional because of what it stands for
But it's in honour of my beautiful daughter to help people and save lives and while I'm doing this, it's like she's still here, her name is being mentioned all the time

Sarah McGill, from Derry in northern Ireland, said her concerns started when her six-year-old girl Niamh, didn't want to interact with others from an early age A mum-of-two has described how she spotted signs that her daughter was autistic at just six months old
Sarah McGill said her concerns began when daughter Niamh, six, didn't want to interact from an early age
She said signs that Niamh had Autism Spectrum Disorder emerged when she was just six months old, but she wasn't formally diagnosed until the age of three, MyDerry reports
Her local GP turned Sarah away, ruling out the possibility of autism on several occasions, Ms McGill said
She said: At six months we started to notice that my daughter didn’t like to be around anyone except myself and my husband, she was constantly crying
At that time we thought it was colic as the GP had ruled out everything else
Although in hindsight I can recognise that it was sensory overload
Her environments were too overstimulating for her and her crying was the only communication tool she had at that time
Niamh hit all her infant milestones late and some not at all
She began flapping hands, lining her toys up and her communication began to regress, she stopped babbling and vocalising
She was so content in her own little bubble
All this carried on for another year, with little to no change in her development
We saw a paediatrician at 18 months, and she said Niamh presents with autism
That was the beginning of our journey
I found I had to learn to think quickly on my feet and develop strategies to make life easier for my daughter
Last year, Sarah began to blog Niamh's journey, through AutisticAlly, which now has over 3,000 followers online
The Derry mum said it's only since setting up the blog that she realised how other families across Northern Ireland were struggling to cope
However, she said there was no need for families to fear the word autism
She said: Autism is not a word to be feared, it is a person to be accepted and loved
It is a word that explains why people behave and think differently
If you have questions about autism, ask an autistic person
The more we talk about autism, the more widely recognised it will become
Yes, autistic people share the same core similarities but how an autistic person experiences the world around them is completely unique to them
What is happening where you live? Find out by adding your postcode
Understanding each person as an individual is key and realising what works for one person may not work for another
Meanwhile, Sarah also revealed recently that she too had been diagnosed with the disorder, saying it had left her feeling numb
It took me a while to process the information and what it meant, Sarah added
I’m still the same person I was before my diagnosis but it has brought clarity to my life
It is an explanation of why I behave the way I do and why I see and feel things differently from other people
It is a life-affirming experience that is teaching me to be kinder to myself
People often say, at my age why would I want to label myself as autistic, but what they don’t know is that I was already labelling myself as a failure, anxious, confused, not good enough, weird, and faking my way through life
I always felt like an outsider, looking into a world that wasn’t built for me
Not understanding why people behave the way they do and why people don’t say what they mean
I was a people pleaser that was riddled with anxiety and depression but still had a smile on my face because I wanted to ‘fit in’, I wanted people to like me
I now have this positive label
This is an explanation that answers my questions about how I’ve experienced my life
It fits, I fit here
She said it's paramount that more awareness is spread about autism inclusion and acceptance
The more we talk about autism, the more widely recognised it will become in our society, she said
Unless you have a child like my Niamh, who was luckily diagnosed so early in life
Many parents out there are fighting for their children to be heard, the only way that autistic people are going to be diagnosed quicker is for autism training to be made mandatory in all schools
With specific training on how women on the spectrum present differently to many boys
So many girls, like myself are being overlooked because they are quiet and don’t make a fuss
I want these girls to know that they aren’t alone

Mum-of-two, Tinuke Awe, says there is a huge lack of representation in educational resources about autism for children
Now, she's on a mission to release her very own children's book to prove that diversity in books can help break the stigma against autism
Publishers have been criticised for ignoring Black children in books about autism
Mum-of-two, Tinuke Awe, is now writing her own book after failing to find any literature to support her son when he was diagnosed with autism
Black pupils are reported to have the highest rate of autism in the UK, being 26% more likely to have autism than their white counterparts
Yet, a study by Centre for Literacy in Primary Education (CLPE) reported only 7% of the children’s books published in the UK over the last three years featured characters of colour
Ms Awe wants her book to help tackle the stigmas and taboos about the condition
She said: What a lot of people don't know is the prevalence of autism is higher in black children
And those are only the diagnoses that we actually know about
What about the ones that are in denial, the ones that are not seeking help, the ones that are still going through the process and still waiting for a diagnosis
I just want everyone to know that autism is not a bad thing
Because there's this lack of awareness
Some of the Black community just assume it's a bad thing, she said
Ms Awe's son, Ezekiel, was diagnosed with autism last year in June and was the first member in her family to have autism
While looking for resources, Ms Awe realised the lack of representation of black characters with special needs in children's books
My son is almost five
So four, five years ago, there were a few books but there weren't really any educational [autism] resources, she said
So like posters and flashcards and things that you would use outside of books
And I looked and I thought, ‘what is going on?’
How come there's such a lack of representation of black children?
Ms Awe says the lack of educational materials is reinforcing the stigmas and taboos around autism
Only 7% of books published in 2020 had minority ethnics as the main character, that's even less for black people and even less for a black person with special needs, she said
If a child is old enough to read or listen to a book, then they're old enough for us to start teaching them about differences and autism, she said
Ms Awe says the book will take inspiration from her son and his friends to show autism is not something to fear
I think first and foremost, it's important to introduce Ezekiel as the main character and his traits so that they can look out for them and understand that he has strengths and weaknesses just like anybody else, she said
So non-autistic children might be good at maths and maybe not so good at P. E
Ezekiel might be good at ordering things but he's not so good at speaking
I want to show that autism is not something to fear and it's not someone to be scared of
It's just a difference, she said
And whilst Ms Awe hopes her book can educate children, she wants adults as well to be able to learn something about autism
I say the book is for children, but honestly it's a book for adults as well
It's about the children, but it's about the adults as well, she said
Because when adults don't understand and they can't adequately explain it to the children, then they just continue to build a generation of people who are kind of ignorant
So what I'm planning to do is have a section at the end for adults, with talking points and questions that they can ask
Telling them about what autism means, and how to be around someone if they are showing traits, she said
Ms Awe says when she found out about her son's diagnosis, she felt both scared and relieved
It was a scary time
This time last year I was a completely different person
I put my hands up and say, I didn't know enough about it
I knew a little bit because of my background but it's different when it's your child, she said
But it also felt like a wave of relief because it's like, I can finally explain his behaviours and I can get him adequate support, she said
With her website, Mums and Tea, which she started in 2017, Ms Awe says she's been able to share her experience with other mums
I have so many Black mums and Black parents on my platform who are going through the same thing and don’t even know where to start, she said
They have seen the signs and are a bit worried or burying their head under the sand and are in denial because autism is still such a taboo subject in the Black community
Her story has encouraged others to come out and share their experience in raising children with autism, inspiring those who would once shy away from the subject
She said: A mum sent me a message that literally almost brought me to tears
She said, ‘God bless you
As many walk your shoes, but don't have the courage to do what you're doing
Instead they just suffer in silence, but you've broken so many barriers and you allow people to feel safe and you fill a gap that was so needed
’ When you hear things like, how could I not keep going?, she said
Ms Awe is now fundraising to have the book self published, with £3,000 raised out of her £18,000 goal

Cassie Lee from Mold, Flintshire, claims Sychdyn Riding School refused to allow her daughter Maddie to have horse riding lessons because she is autistic, with the school claiming it was down to its insurance policy A furious mum claims her daughter was refused a horse riding lesson because her autism was too bad
Cassie Lee, from Mold, Flintshire, said her 14-year-old daughter Maddie was turned down because of her additional needs
The heartbroken mum-of-three said a member of staff at Sychdyn Riding School asked how bad Maddie's autism was before refusing to allow the booking
Cassie said the incident is a painful reminder how people with disabilities are still not treated equally, North Wales Live reports
Sychdyn Riding School told North Wales Live it was necessary to access Maddie's disability due to insurance concerns to ensure the safety of staff and customers
A spokesperson for the school, based near Mold, added: We have to consider everyone's safety, there's protocol we have to follow, and if people have different needs we have to factor that in, we don't want to put anyone at risk
We've never come up against this in all the years
We're not discriminating, we're just sticking to within the law
However, Cassie claims it was direct discrimination and showed a lack of empathy for people with special needs
She added: I'm heartbroken, if I'm honest
I'm hurt because I've had to watch my little girl upset because she couldn't go, just because she's autistic
People these days say people with autism are accepted but we face struggles every day and no one sees that side of things
It's really upsetting that people just write her off because everyone who knows Maddie loves her and knows how great she is, people on the street say 'hiya' to her before me because she's so popular
Maddie's autism means she communicates and expresses her emotions differently to others
But Cassie said this is no reason for her daughter to miss out on things other children get to do
Cassie said the riding school had been willing to take the booking when Maddie's dad, Danny Brockley, had called on March 23
But things changed when they learnt of Maddie's autism, Cassie claims
She said: Maddie's dad called up first and spoke to someone and it was all fine but when he mentioned she had autism they said they couldn't do it
They said it should be no problem until he explained that Maddie has autism and she might get excited when she sees the horses, and then they said she couldn't come
Maddie stims which means she flaps her arms and makes noises when she gets excited but that's just how she reacts and she shouldn't be treated differently to anyone else
The mum-of-three added: What upset me the most was how dismissive they were, it's like they heard the word autism and made their minds up
They kept asking 'how bad is it? How bad is her autism?,' But it's not bad, autism isn't something bad it's just different
I just want my little girl to be able to do what she enjoys
The devastated mum added she would not have allowed her daughter on a horse if it wasn't safe
But Sychdyn Riding School said they needed different insurance to work with Maddie safely, and recommended Clwyd Special Riding Centre, which specialises in riding for people with additional needs
A spokesperson said: We're just trying to stick within the rules that have been given to us, and there are places available which are specifically set up for people with different needs
On the insurance explanation, she said: They did come back after and explain to me about the insurance, but the thing that hurt me was the way they approached it, because it felt like she was just being told no because of her autism
In this day and age, people who were born with disabilities are still not treated the same and not able to do the same things as other people
She added: We have spoken to other parents with ASD and did consider others but we ended up going to a riding school in Flintshire, which doesn't specialise in disabilities
I'm glad we found a school who understood her

Disability Rights UK (DR UK) said they should have made reasonable adjustments to ensure Maddie could ride
Fazilet Hadi, head of policy at leading equality charity DR UK claimed the riding school's actions: The Equality Act is clear that reasonable adjustments must be made for people with disabilities
Laws have been in place for over 25 years to allow Disabled people to take part in mainstream activities with non-disabled people
It would appear that Maddie has no additional needs that require anything more than a little time for her to adjust to being around the horses
All the riding school needed to do was to adopt a can-do attitude and let her ride the horse

Popular and well-respected travel manager, Jennifer Joynt, 36, was found dead in her home after the love of a 'toxic partner' who allegedly faked his cancer consumed her A famous businesswoman was found dead after her whole life turned upside down and 'messed up' by a man who allegedly faked having stage four cancer in a bid to control her
Jennifer Joynt, 36, a supply chain manager, was tragically found dead in her bed by her dad, after he forced his way into her home in Manchester on February 26, report Manchester Evening News
Her family became concerned about her after they hadn't heard from her in days
An inquest into her death, held at South Manchester Coroner’s Court, heard the woman - who was born in Stockport - had experienced problems with her mental health in the past
The court heard that family and friends supported her during these difficult periods of her life
The inquest also outlined that while there were signs Ms Joynt was considering suicide, she did not appear to have taken her own life
Notes addressed to her family and friends in notebooks were found by police, scattered around her room
There were also notes on her phone, as well as video messages recorded for her loved ones, in the months before her death
Police found that while some of these notes had been edited on her mobile, there was nothing to indicate they were true indications that she intended to take her own life
Similar notes had also been written on other occasions, which had not led to her attempting to take her own life
There was evidence that Ms Joynt had attempted to purchase a particular drug, which has appeared in several other suicide inquests recently
While police were able to establish that most of the companies the 36-year-old reached out to had declined the sale
There was one purchase attempt that had not been declined, but officers were unable to establish whether the sale had gone through and whether the substance was delivered
Police said they could not find any evidence of packaging or a container for this substance in the home, although when Miss Joynt’s phone was unlocked by officers, they discovered that she had been visiting a site instructing her on what medications to take alongside this substance to take her own life
Traces of these drugs were found within her system
Professor Hunt, the pathologist who performed the post mortem examination of Miss Joynt, gave her cause of death as aspiration of gastric contents
This means that food or fluid she had consumed had caused a blockage in her windpipe or lungs
Toxicology results showed a range of non-lethal levels of various drugs in her system, but these were not highlighted as contributing factors to Miss Joynt’s death
Ms Joynt's mum, Margaret, told the court about her bubbly and strong daughter who embraced life and loved fitness and travelling
However, she also said an extremely toxic relationship in the months before her daughter's death consumed her, with the young woman unable to let go of her partner who allegedly faked having stage four cancer in a bid to control her
After a tough few months of set-backs, things started to look up for Miss Joynt, with the young woman in the process of buying a new house, set to start a new job just weeks after her death, and even taking trips away with friends and making plans to spend time with those around her
Her dad told the court his daughter spoke to people that were struggling and actively tried to help them and just seemed to love life so much, leaving her family feeling like she was finally turning a corner and starting to get better after a horrific ordeal
Senior coroner Alison Mutch recorded a narrative conclusion that Miss Joynt died from complications of asphyxia, as it was impossible to tell on the balance of probabilities whether or not the young woman had ingested something in an attempt to take her own life
Addressing Ms Joynt’s family she said: As a family you were devoted to each other and as parents you had supported her
She was obviously very popular and very successful, and was extremely well thought of at work and she had a very bright future ahead of her
She was extremely fortunate to have such a caring family
Ms Joynt’s family established the Jenni Joynt Foundation, which aims to help others who have faced, or are facing similar mental health challenges to which she succumbed
The 39-year-old was a well-known and hugely popular figure across the business travel industry
She had worked as a travel manager at NatWest Group/RBS since 2016, and was best-known as a long-time member of the Institute of Travel Management (ITM) and as an active and passionate member of its Northern Regional Committee
During her spare time, it is reported that she enjoyed a range of fitness activities, including open water swimming
ITM celebrated her life at its annual conference in Birmingham in April, with its CEO, Scott Davies, paying tribute to her
He said: Jenni was an incredibly special, vibrant and energetic member of the ITM community
Her natural desire to make everyone feel welcome and valued set the tone at our events and struck anyone that she met
Jenni’s warmth, humour, empathy and talent were admired by so many of us
Jenni would simply light up a room and any situation you can imagine – a business meeting, an education session, a conference, a gym class, an evening in a bar – was just infinitely better if Jenni was there
We miss her so much already and we will always remember her, and we will look to find positive ways to help those facing struggles any way we can

Forklift driver Barry Douglas, 44, and friend Claire Vickers, 46, appeared on ITV's This Morning in wheelchairs to talk about the accident which left them with life-changing injuries A man left in a wheelchair after a drunken waterpark accident took his own life just six months later, an inquest heard
Forklift driver Barry Douglas, 44, broke both his legs after sneaking into the lido with a friend at 2am and crashing into the barrier of a closed flume tube
The life-changing injuries left Barry, from Dundee, unable to work as he could not drive, forcing him to move house
The hearing in Winchester, heard that Barry, had moved to Aldershot with his stepfather at the age of 20 and had set up a stable life for himself
Despite some signs his condition was improving, Scottish-born Douglas took his own life in his studio flat in February of this year, the inquest was told
The Glasgow Rangers fan had been working as a forklift truck driver up until the time of his accident on the water slide
The inquest heard that in August 2021 having consumed a considerable amount of alcohol, Barry made the impulsive decision with Claire to break into Aldershot Lido
When the pair went down the water slide they slammed into a steel barrier that was blocking the end and sustained serious injuries
Reports at the time said they were then trapped for two hours before being rescued
Both Barry and friend, Claire Vickers, 46, appeared on ITV's This Morning in wheelchairs to talk about the incident
The inquest was also told that Douglas had a history of taking recreational drugs including cocaine and heroine
He had also spent a short time drug dealing and was stabbed in 2011, the inquest heard
Barry began experiencing a low mood and was known to drink between 500ml-1L of vodka a day, the inquest was told
His GP told the hearing that he had been prescribed anti-depressants following his lido accident
His mother, Ruth Douglas told the inquest that he had been desperate to get back to work after the accident
She added that doctors had told Barry that it might take up to two years to get his mobility back and that he was worried about being crippled
Barry's friends, having not heard from him for several days, contacted his tenant welfare officer who found him hanged in his flat in Aldershot in February 2022, the inquest heard
A post-mortem report read to the court stated that Barry had consumed a significant amount of alcohol before his death
Senior Coroner for Hampshire Christopher Wilkinson said that there was 'no clear explanation' for why Barry took his own life
Mr Wilkinson: He set himself up here in the UK
He started to consume alcohol to a greater extent and had been using street drugs
His [water slide] injuries were, in my opinion, life-changing
In his last few days there had been some hope that he was returning to work and was driving again
There was also a possibility that he was moving to other accommodation
It's regrettable that I cannot establish what he was thinking
He took his own life impulsively under the influence of alcohol, Mr Wilkinson added
The coroner recorded a conclusion of suicide

Laura Jordan, from Redditch, Worcs, said her son Zac has fallen behind during the seven months he has spent at home following his expulsion - and he still cannot read or even write his own name A five-year-old boy expelled for bad behaviour will have spent a year at home before he fully returns to school
Little Zac was just four-years-old when he was booted out of his school in October over behavioural issues
Mum Laura, 36, told the council her son had undiagnosed special educational needs and resisted attempts to send him to another mainstream school
The 36-year-old, from Redditch, Worcs, slammed Worcestershire County Council for failing to find Zac a place at a special needs school following his expulsion
She has even accused the council of breaking the law after Zac reached compulsory school age and was still stuck at home
However, Zac has now finally been offered a place at a new autism unit at Chaddesley Corbett school in Kidderminster
Laura told The Mirror: The council have now offered Zac a school place and we will start the slow process of reintegration after the next half term, with an aim to start full time in September
Although Laura is pleased that Zac is finally returning to the classroom, she voiced concerns that her son will have missed out on almost a year of full-time education
She said: September is a long time away.  He’s fallen behind
He can’t read or write at the moment
He should know how to write his name and he should be starting to read
His name is only three letters and he can’t write that.  It’s sad
It’s affecting his development massively
Socially he’s not where he should be at
He’s going to find it harder to socialise with children now
Laura previously said her son had spent so much time in the house that he was scared to go outside
Just days before receiving the news about Zac’s place, Laura told The Mirror that Worcestershire County Council had broken the law by missing the deadline to get her son back into school
She said: The law states that the term after their fifth birthday they should be in education
Jack turned five in February so on April 26 he should’ve been back in school as that’s when the kids went back after Easter.  It’s so frustrating
They have had since October to sort this out
Worcestershire County Council has broken the law now
If as a parent I didn’t send my son to school when they turned five I would be taken to court - or they would want to know why he wasn’t in school
Zac was expelled from Holly Hill Church School, in Rubery, Worcs, within five weeks of joining reception class
He was booted out over a number of behaviour problems, including attacks on other pupils and staff
Laura explained that her life has been on hold for the past seven months while looking after Zac at home
She has not been able to work because she does not have anyone around who is able to watch him
Although she has tried to teach him at home, Zac quickly loses interest
Laura is speaking out to raise awareness about the difficulties in accessing proper education for children with special needs
She said parents face a postcode lottery as councils have different policies for special educational needs
The mum claimed that while Birmingham City Council would have offered her son alternative education immediately after his expulsion, this was not an option in Worcestershire

Laura previously said she thought the UK's compulsory school age should be lowered to four-years-old to ensure children stay in education once they start school
Worcestershire councillor Marcus Hart, cabinet member for education, said: We are pleased to be able to confirm that a suitable place has been identified for Zac at Chaddesley Corbett Primary School
Zac will start school after the half term in June with an appropriate package of support to help him transition back into education
We acknowledge the delay in finding a suitable placement to meet Zac’s needs and apologise for the frustrations that this process has caused to both Zac and his family
We would like to wish him every success in his new school and his wider educational journey
Mr Hart previously acknowledged that the law required all children to start full-time education by the beginning of the term following their fifth birthday
In March, he told The Mirror that he hoped to have Zac ready to start school in April
A Department for Education spokesperson previously said: Suspensions and permanent exclusions should only be used as a last resort, but we back headteachers to suspend or exclude pupils where it is necessary and helps maintain calm classrooms
We are consulting on changes to behaviour and exclusions guidance to make sure this is used in a fair way, and the cross-government SEND Review will further consult on how children with special educational needs and disabilities are supported by the system, including in alternative provision

Jack turned five in February so on April 26 he should’ve been back in school as that’s when the kids went back after Easter.  It’s so frustrating
They have had since October to sort this out
Worcestershire County Council has broken the law now
If as a parent I didn’t send my son to school when they turned five I would be taken to court - or they would want to know why he wasn’t in school
Zac was expelled from Holly Hill Church School, in Rubery, Worcs, within five weeks of joining reception class
He was booted out over a number of behaviour problems, including attacks on other pupils and staff
Laura explained that her life has been on hold for the past seven months while looking after Zac at home
She has not been able to work because she does not have anyone around who is able to watch him
Although she has tried to teach him at home, Zac quickly loses interest
Laura is speaking out to raise awareness about the difficulties in accessing proper education for children with special needs
She said parents face a postcode lottery as councils have different policies for special educational needs
The mum claimed that while Birmingham City Council would have offered her son alternative education immediately after his expulsion, this was not an option in Worcestershire

Laura previously said she thought the UK's compulsory school age should be lowered to four-years-old to ensure children stay in education once they start school
Worcestershire councillor Marcus Hart, cabinet member for education, said: We are pleased to be able to confirm that a suitable place has been identified for Zac at Chaddesley Corbett Primary School
Zac will start school after the half term in June with an appropriate package of support to help him transition back into education
We acknowledge the delay in finding a suitable placement to meet Zac’s needs and apologise for the frustrations that this process has caused to both Zac and his family
We would like to wish him every success in his new school and his wider educational journey
Mr Hart previously acknowledged that the law required all children to start full-time education by the beginning of the term following their fifth birthday
In March, he told The Mirror that he hoped to have Zac ready to start school in April
A Department for Education spokesperson previously said: Suspensions and permanent exclusions should only be used as a last resort, but we back headteachers to suspend or exclude pupils where it is necessary and helps maintain calm classrooms
We are consulting on changes to behaviour and exclusions guidance to make sure this is used in a fair way, and the cross-government SEND Review will further consult on how children with special educational needs and disabilities are supported by the system, including in alternative provision

WARNING, DISTURBING CONTENT: Semina Halliwell took her own life after an interview with police and her distraught mum has raised concerns about how her daughter's rape allegation was handled A heartbroken mum who raised concerns about how police handled her daughter's rape allegation has shared a haunting final photo taken days before she took her own life
Semina Halliwell, 12, died after spending four nights in hospital days after a police interview where she was made to feel like an inconvenience
Her grieving mum Rachel wants everyone to see the harrowing last picture of her little girl taken just days before her death last year, the Liverpool Echo reports
The Year 7 pupil from Southport, Merseyside, told police she was raped by an older boy who she said had groomed her over Snapchat
Rachel has now released a photograph of Semina taken in hospital just days before she died, as she raised concerns over how the youngster was treated after coming forward
The parent said Merseyside Police officers investigating the alleged rape made Semina feel like an 'inconvenience' and has complained to the Independent Office for Police Conduct
Rachel reached out to police after Semina broke down and told her about the alleged rape following a severe incident of self-harm
She says she wants the image released today to act as a warning to others on the devastating impact bullying can have on others
Rachel said a detective started talking about all the forms he'd have to fill in and how long it would take him to fill those forms in
The mother's aunt Clare Halliwell says the detective then told Semina: It's your word against his and do you really want this hanging over your head for 18 months, because it wouldn't go to court for 18 months to two years
Rachel says she believes police failed her daughter
Merseyside Police today said it was not appropriate to comment on the issues raised ahead of a planned inquest into Semina's death
A spokesperson for the force said: The matter is currently being considered by the Sefton, Knowsley and St Helens coroner and as such it is not appropriate for Merseyside Police to comment on any of the substantive issues raised at this time, as we would not wish to prejudice the coronial investigation
However, we have, and are, co-operating fully with the coroner in this matter
A spokesperson for the coroners' office also said they were unable to comment on this or any case that is under investigation
The spokesperson added: The date of inquest will be published in due course
Semina's tragic case was raised at a parliamentary committee on June 23, 2021, when Labour MP Apsana Begum asked then-Education Secretary Gavin Williamson what more could be done to help protect children from sexual harassment and abuse
Ms Begum said: I wanted to highlight the case of Semina who was 12 years old who disclosed that she'd been raped, and has committed suicide last week
Following her death, Rachel feared Semina's bullies would gatecrash her funeral
Rachel had initially said everyone is invited to celebrate Semina's short life, but she later received some horrifying messages
Screenshots seen by the publication appeared to show someone who knew Semina telling Rachel they had been told they'd get battered at the funeral if they attended
The message continued: I'm scared to go

Police officers were in attendance at the funeral, which went ahead without incident
But less than three months later, Rachel was left devastated after the grave of her 12-year-old daughter was trashed by yobs
In September, a family friend found Semina's grave had been completely desecrated
Rachel told the ECHO: It was covered in bricks and rocks and there was dog mess all over it
It was clearly done on purpose
At the time, Community Inspector Graham Fisher said the force and the community shared the family's shock and revulsion over the desecration of Semina's grave
He said This is the final resting place of a beloved family member, and I can only imagine how upsetting it must have been for their loved ones to find that the grave had been treated in this way
While thankfully no permanent damage has been caused, it will have caused lasting distress to the family
Merseyside Police today confirmed no charges or arrests have been made in relation to the attack on Semina's grave

Rho Miller says that her assistance dog Lyra has transformed her life after the Labrador helped her to become more independent I’m grateful for her beyond words, and that I love her with all my heart
Rho Miller says that's what she'd tell her beloved dog Lyra if she could explain how much the Labrador means to her
Lyra is an assistance dog for Rho, from Cornwall, and has been an invaluable addition to the 20-year-old’s life by helping her with everyday tasks she used to struggle immensely with
I already tell her every day how much I love her, and I wish she could truly understand what that means, Rho says
How much she has changed my life for the better
Rho was diagnosed as autistic back in 2019
I always suspected that something was different, even when I was younger, she says
I always struggled at school, especially with bullying
I often used to pretend I was sick so I wouldn’t have to go to school, in fear of what might happen that day
Rho says that even as an adult, she was terrified of going places on her own because of the panic and sensory overload that would come with visiting busy places such as supermarkets and shops
But since getting assistance dog Lyra, Rho’s life has been transformed
Rho has trained the gorgeous Labrador to help her with daily tasks, and having Lyra by her side has allowed her to do things that would have previously been unthinkable
Lyra has improved my well-being more than I could ever expect, Rho says
Because of her I am so much more independent, I have more confidence in myself along with a higher self-esteem, and I enjoy my life way more than I did before
She is my little companion and best friend - I often say she is my partner in crime! Lyra helps Rho with chores around the house, from assisting with laundry to keeping her owner company while she’s brushing her teeth or showering
This distracts me from my anxiety, stops me from getting stressed about the task that I’m trying to do, and reminds me that I’m not alone, Rho says
The Labrador can also do deep pressure therapy, which means putting her weight on Rho’s legs to keep her calm - this allows her owner to recover from sensory overload much more quickly
Without this, I would be frozen in place in a shutdown state for a long time, and I would be exhausted from this episode so much that I would not be able to do anything for the rest of the day, Rho explains
When the pair go out, Lyra can guide Rho safely around their environment by following directions, helping to find places such as a checkout or exit
Without Lyra guiding me, I would end up very lost, says Rho
Now I thoroughly enjoy going out, because Lyra keeps me safe and grounded
Although Lyra is incredibly focused and dedicated in her assistance dog role, when she’s off-duty the pup’s big personality is always making Rho laugh
As soon as you take her working harness off, and say the magic words ‘all done working’, she switches into the most energetic, playful, and humorous dog, and will run around the house grabbing her toys and showing them to you proudly
Rho shares her daily adventures with Lyra on her Instagram page @lifewithlyralab , and hopes that their heart-warming story will show others just how important assistance dogs can be in helping disabled people
Society teaches us that we are not enough; that we should stay at home, and that we need to act more ‘normal’ and ‘get over ourselves’ if we want to succeed in life, Rho says
But by having an assistance dog, we can achieve so much more than society gives us credit for, while still being ourselves

Mum Candice Hudspith had just entered the Mcdonald's near Gateshead when four-year-old Harper started screaming and crying but thankfully a kind member of staff stepped in to help A mum has shared a heartwarming message of thanks after a touching display of kindness from a McDonald's staff member which meant the world to her autistic daughter
Candice Hudspith, 33, from Gateshead, visited the McDonald's on the Felling Bypass near Newcastle last weekend with her two daughters, Harper, four, and Indy, two
As they entered the restaurant Harper, who was diagnosed with autism just before her fourth birthday, suddenly became triggered, beginning to scream and shout
Often, Candice said, she would leave a situation if Harper started to struggle
But thanks to the kindness of one of the restaurant's staff members, the busy mum was able to stay and enjoy a relaxing coffee, while Harper was able to calm down and enjoy a meal
Candice said: I don't know what had triggered Harper, when I got out of the car I knew she was hungry, but there was just something triggering her and the difficult thing is you can't ask what it is
Walking in she was screaming, saying 'no no no'
Everyone is looking at me like I am the mother with the screaming child
As I was walking in Rachel, one of the workers, said 'oh wow I think I have a flag would you like one?' And she looked at me and said 'you're doing an amazing job'
Harper ran off and hid under a seat, so the considerate worker got down on the floor with paper and crayons, inviting the little girl to colour in with her
Candice said: You could see Harper slowly coming out of herself
She was back in her little world, being happy Harper again
I literally burst into tears
I felt like I didn't even have to say that she has autism, it was like she read my mind
It was so lovely what she was doing
I don't think Rachel realised how good her customer service was
It may sound like nothing to others but it meant the world to me.  Absolutely outstanding service
When Candice shared her thanks to Rachel on Facebook, her post received over 3,000 likes as people praised the McDonald's worker
The mum said she was touched by the response and shared her story in an effort to thank Rachel
She added she wanted to show difference small acts of kindness can make to struggling parents
Candice said she was also keen to encourage more people to be understanding of autism, the diagnosis that has helped her ensure her daughter gets the help she needs
What is happening where you live? Find out by adding your postcode
She said: At the moment I'm doing a course on autism just so I can be more understanding, but when she was younger - and I think quite a lot of mums could relate to this - I was, not quite in denial, but I felt as if I didn't want to label my child
But once you get the help and you have the diagnosis you realise it's not labelling your child, it's getting them the help that they need
All the doors open up and you are able to get the best for your child
If I had still been in denial I don't know where Harper would be now, but with me being the mum I am and having the support around me she's come on so much
If you do see a situation like that in public, you really shouldn't judge
I think our generation is starting to understand a lot more about autism, back in the day it would be just seen as 'naughty children' but I think there is more understanding now

Police in the US believe prisoner Casey White wasn't smart enough to plan the breakout and said exemplary employee Vicky White was in the perfect position to organise it all A prison guard who took her own life after being on the run with a murderer for 11 days was the mastermind behind the the whole plan, police believe
Hulking 6ft9 prisoner Casey White - alleged to have been officer Vicky White's lover - wasn't smart enough to plan it all, according to Lauderdale County Sheriff Rick Singleton
In an interview with CNN, Singleton said 56-year-old Vicky - who he described as an exemplary employee - was in a position to coordinate the jailbreak, organising a van in the morning and ensuring all the armed deputies were not in the building
She knew that the booking officer wasn’t going to question her, the assistant director, when she told her that she was going to take him to court and drop him off with other employees, Singleton told the network
Not long before she died by suicide, Vicky seemed to be angry at Casey, 38, for deciding to stay at a motel
Some of her last words were recorded by police as officers rammed into the pair's Cadillac into a ditch after a dramatic chase
She's heard saying: Airbags are going off
Let’s get out and run
And then: You had to stay in some f****** motel
Vicky, who had made up a bogus medical appointment for the felon on April 29, shot herself moments later
Singleton said wigs, weapons including an AR-15 rifle, a 9mm handgun and $29,000 worth of cash had also been found
He said Vicky had sold her house to raise the funds
She would have been facing up to 10 years in prison for helping Casey escape
Singleton said Vicky, formerly second command at Alabama's Lauderdale County Jail, was a much liked, respected employee who other staff viewed as a mother figure
She was even about to be awarded Employee of the Year for the fifth time
What in the world provoked her, or prompted her, to pull something like this, I don’t know
I don’t know if we’ll ever know, he said
I had every bit of trust in Vicky White
She had been an exemplary employee
Casey appeared before a judge in Alabama on Tuesday night charged with escaping prison
Previously Vanderburgh County Sheriff Dave Wedding said that because a large number of guns were found inside the car, if Vicky and Casey they had not been rammed off the road the day could have ended with more bloodshed
He told reporters: We later found out that [if they hadn’t rammed the vehicle], the fugitive was going to engage in a shootout with law enforcement
That action may have saved many of my deputies and fellow law enforcement officers’ lives
The couple, who were not related, are said to have been in a jailhouse romance for around two years
Their dramatic escape came on the eve of Vicky’s retirement as a correctional officer
Since their 2020 meeting, Vicky had regularly been driving the two hours to where Casey was incarcerated, at the William E Donaldson Correctional Facility
She gave a false name to prison authorities

Kieran, from Walsall, had increasingly isolated himself following relationship problems according to his sister and moved into shared accommodation rather than ask friends for help A sister whose golden-hearted brother took his own life hopes his death will help other men address their own mental health
Kieran Huntington took his own life last week despite appearing to be in good spirits, according to his older sister Danielle
Danielle says that 25-year-old Kieran had been dealing with ongoing mental health issues following the death of his mum when he was 17
She says Kieran, from Walsall, had increasingly isolated himself following relationship problems and moved into shared accommodation rather than seek help from family and friends
And now Danielle, 29, wants to use her family's tragedy to encourage men who are dealing with difficult circumstances to speak out
Birmingham Live reports that the alarm was raised for Kieran's welfare on Sunday, August 14, after his loved ones became concerned for him
Danielle, originally from Walsall but now living in Stafford, said: The ambulance turned up first, they did try resuscitation, the police and ambulance were in attendance
Instead of asking people for a place to stay, he felt like, as a man, he should have the responsibility for himself and moved into a house share
When he was 17, our mother died
He never sought help to move on from our mum's death
He struggled with it for the last few years
He was always just plodding along and carried on
Danielle hopes the death of her brother will shine a light on mental health and encourage other men who are struggling to seek help
Men should be more open and talk more, express their feelings more and don't keep them bottled up, she said
Whether that is to do with relationship problems, work problems, any problem that they have got, no matter how small or big, just talk about it rather than bottle it up inside
Kieran was a boyhood Liverpool fan and supported Walsall, which was his local team
He also played football and enjoyed fishing
He was a plasterer by trade but also played an active role in the family's dog training business DC K9
Danielle said Kieran was a popular young man with hundreds of friends, adding: I have been speaking to lots of people and they were saying he was laughing and joking all the time, even recently
He had hundreds and hundreds of friends
Paying tribute to her brother, she said: He was all-round nice, sometimes too nice
He would give his last penny to anybody that would need it

Baggage handler Richard Russell, 29, was wearing a T-shirt with The Sky's No Limit written on his back as he opened the door of an Alaskan Airlines propeller jet, jumped in the cockpit and flew 30 miles before taking his own life when he crashed on a remote island A clip has surfaced showing the moment an airport worker hijacked a plane before plunging the aircraft through the air and crash landing on a remote island in an apparent suicide
Surveillance footage from Seattle Airport shows baggage handler Richard Russell, 29, moving through the transit hub wearing a a T-shirt with The Sky's No Limit emblazoned across the back
The clip, recorded in August 2018, then shows Russell heading towards the airport's cargo area around five hours after clearing security
With colleagues walking nearby, he's seen pushing an Alaska Airlines propeller aircraft on to the runway
Air traffic agents tried to make contact with the plane but received no response
He then opens the cabin door, jumps in the cockpit and takes off in the Q400 Turboprop - which is designed for short to medium haul journeys
He tells air traffic control: Seattle ground Horizon guy.  About to take off.  It's gonna be crazy
Hey, I found myself in a predicament
I'm in the air right now
And just gonna soar around
As he soars above Washington state as air traffic controllers beg him to make a safe landing
But Russell won't be swayed and continues to make disturbing jokes with the men in the tower trying to find somewhere he can set the plane down
He says: Hey do you think if I land this successfully Alaska will give me a job as a pilot? After asking if he could see a suitable runway, he replies: Oh those guys will try to rough me up if I try land there… I think I might mess something up there too
I wouldn't want to do that
Oh they probably have got anti-aircraft
The traffic controller responds: They don't have any of that stuff, we are just trying to find you a place to land safely
At one point, he says he's just a broken guy and that he is preparing for jail time for life
According to the Seattle Times, he said he feared disappointing people that care about me by hijacking the aircraft
He added: I would like to apologise to each and every one of them
Just a broken guy, got a few screws loose, I guess
Never really knew it, until now
Moments after the plane took off, two US F-15 fighter jets headed to his position but couldn't intercept him before his tragic descent
Russell crashed on a remote island 30 miles away from Seattle
He died around 90 minutes after taking off
People on the ground reported seeing him performing aerial acrobatics, including barrel rolls and loop-the-loops in the air
Sheriff Paul Pastor said Russell's was like a joyride gone terribly wrong
An FBI report revealed how Russell said he knew how to fly the aircraft solo because he'd played video games in the past
The report said there was no clear motivation for his bizarre actions after investigators probed his background, possible stressors and personal life

Mental health campaigner Trevor Coult has shared his devastation at losing Pete Carson who served in the Royal Irish Regiment with Trevor in Afghanistan and was found dead in a suspected suicide A decorated war hero is mourning his 13th ­comrade lost to the armed forces mental health crisis
Campaigner Trevor Coult, who won the Military Cross for service in Iraq, was devastated to learn last week of the latest death
Pete Carson, who served in the Royal Irish Regiment with Trevor in Afghanistan, was found dead in a suspected suicide
Anguished Trevor, 47, said: In any other profession there would be calls for a major inquiry – but it seems the Government doesn’t mind if those who served their country kill themselves
He added: I was absolutely devastated to learn that Pete had died
That’s at least six people from my old regiment who have died and at least 13 people who I knew or served with have now taken their own lives
There have been more deaths
I don’t think there is any job in the country where someone would know so many people who have taken their own lives
The 12 others who Trevor knew include fellow Afghan vet Brett Savage, 32, who had taken part in a documentary in which he said the Ministry of Defence was not doing enough to help
Before he died he spoke about combat in Afghanistan and said: My unit was under fire for 55 days.  It was non-stop
I saw good men killed
We lost four in total
I was blown up with an RPG and lost the hearing in my right ear
I was also shot in the chest, the body armour saved my life.  I went crazy
I was on drugs, drinking all the time
Shortly after Brett’s death, Sgt Fraser Stirling, also a member of the Royal Irish Regiment and a one-time colleague of Trevor’s, took his own life aged 30
The other tragedies include Northern Ireland veteran Deane Hart, 53, and Capt Gary Case, a veteran of Iraq, who died weeks after being awarded an MBE
Capt Case, 50, had gained ­promotion from the ranks and was one of the most popular officers in the Rifles regiment
Another of those who died was Jamie Davis, also a former member of the Rifles
The 30-year-old dad-of-two hanged himself in January 2020
He had previously suffered shrapnel wounds and witnessed the deaths of colleagues in both Iraq and Afghanistan
His widow Alicia said he had nightmares night and day and was ashamed of his condition
She added: He was screaming in the middle of the night
He was riddled with guilt
One of his best mates got killed and he said that should have been him
The other soldiers and veterans in confirmed or suspected suicides are Danny Johnston, 35, Mitchell Matthews, 24, James Ross, 30, Paul Cochrane, 18, Eddie Murphy, 50, Andy McFarland, 32 and Paul Brennan
Dad of one Trevor, from Suffolk, added: The MoD says that the deaths have nothing in common and there isn’t a problem with suicide
All of those who died had mental health issues, they had all seen combat and they all served in the armed forces – that’s what they had in common
Since 2017 at least 350 veterans and service personnel are believed to have taken their own lives
At least 22 have died from suspected suicides so far this year
The vast majority had seen combat
The MoD said: There are many ­varied and complex reasons why ­someone may take their own life and we will continue to do all that we can to provide support and mental health ­provision to those who have ­dedicated their lives to the service of this country
The Sunday People ’s Save Our Soldiers campaign is calling for a radical overhaul of the way top brass treat mental health

Edward Lake's three children, as well as their grandfather, were killed in a crash in September 2015 by a drunk driver who was then granted full parole last year A dad-of-three whose kids were killed in a horror car crash took his own life after Father's Day so they can all play together forever
Edward Lake, from Ontario, US, was found dead on Monday, the day after Father's Day
On Sunday, Edward’s wife Jennifer Neville-Lake shared a moving photo on social media showing their children’s grave
Then, late on Monday, she also tweeted the tragic news about her husband’s death
The couple’s three children were killed in a crash in September 2015 in Vaughan, caused by drunk driver Marco Muzzo, Global News reports
Daniel Neville-Lake, nine, Harrison, five, and Milly, two, as well as the children’s grandfather, Gary Neville, 65, were killed in the collision
The children’s grandmother and great-grandmother were also badly injured
During Muzzo’s sentencing, Edward said he had suffered from suicidal thoughts and anxiety since the crash
In February 2021, Muzzo was granted full parole
Sharing the devastating news about her husband's death, Jennifer tweeted: The eyes he shared with Harry are forever closed Daniel's curls will never shine in the sunlight again I will never see Milly's shy smile creep across his lips anymore
My children's father, Edward Lake, has joined our kids so they can play together, forever
Just the day before, she had tweeted after visiting their children's graves, writing: Father’s Day 2022.  This shouldn’t be real.  It can’t be

Golf pro gives lesson to brave William Verden, 16, who is being kept alive using dialysis and is at the centre of a court battle with doctors over his treatment Right-to-life battle teen William Verden enjoys a golf lesson – as his family gets ready for a court fight
The 16-year-old golf fan – battling kidney failure – was thrilled to get tips from pro Trevor Newsham
The Sunday People told last month how William, who also has autism, is kept alive by gruelling dialysis sessions, and doctors at Manchester Children’s Hospital say that his only option now is palliative care
Mum Amy and dad Will, disagree – arguing their son, who has focal ­segmental glomerulosclerosis, has a good quality of life and can even play golf twice a week
Trevor, 34, was impressed with his swing saying: He seemed really bright, taking it on board and hit great shots.  He’s got some ability
Amy, 45, of Newton, Lancs, said after Friday’s session at Heysham Golf Club in Morecambe: It was great.  He loved it
She and Will are now preparing to make an application to court after it was agreed medical mediation is not the right approach

Layth Maumoniat had struggled since losing his mum two years ago, and in April the year seven schoolboy was tragically found dead by his older sister after he became emotional A dad has paid emotional tribute to his 12-year-old son who took his own life two years after his mum's suicide
Young Layth Maumoniat, a year even at Allerton High School, was said to have been 'emotional and screaming' before he was found dead by his older sister
Grieving dad Ali Maumoniat told LeedsLive : We've lost him and we feel empty
He was the funniest lad and the personality in our household
He added: He was so emotional and an hour later his sister came running and was screaming and he was found dead
Allah gave me my beautiful boy Layth 12 years ago but sadly I today have to return him back to his Lord where he'll be with the rest of the angels and reunited with his mum
In 2020, at just 10 years old, Layth lost his mum to suicide and often struggled after his mother's death, Ali said
I just cannot imagine what was going through his head at that moment
I think all he was thinking was that he'll be back with his mum, he said
May the angels lift you in their wings and take you to the highest paradise my beautiful little lion
On April 30, days after the schoolboy's death, a balloon release, organised by his friends from school, happened in Alwoodley, Leeds
Hundreds turned out with blue and white balloons as well as a balloon arch in the shape of a cross
Ali and family held a funeral for Laythe on Wednesday (May 4) at Leeds Grand Mosque in Woodsley Road, Hyde Park
His dad said: It was a beautiful turnout
Everyone was there from kids to parents and non-Muslim and Muslim families
Everyone was very respectful at the Grand Mosque where the prayers were given to Layth
The news also brought sadness to hundreds of people across Leeds
Many shared their condolences across social media, sending well wishes to Layth's family
Mandy Grainger said: Absolutely heartbreaking
Thoughts are with your family
Jacqueline Stott added: Aww so sad RIP
Love to his family and friends
Claire Crann added: My heart breaks for him and his family
I have a son the same age and I just cannot imagine losing him
Dipak Parmar said: RIP little prince
May you find salvation and eternal happiness in the kingdom of God where you are forever safe.  Rest little one
Barbara Paley shared her condolences and said: This is very sad, why does it keep happening, and Lora Benson added: This is so sad
A Leeds City Council spokesperson added: The death of Layth Maumoniat is extremely sad and we offer our sincere condolences to his family, friends and everyone else who knew him
We are working closely with the school to ensure staff and pupils are supported through this difficult time
A spokesperson for Allerton High School confirmed they were told the pupil had died, but haven't heard anything else since then
They issued a brief statement on behalf of the school and said: All we can confirm at the moment is that a young student, a year seven student, has died

Last Thursday, five family members jumped one-by-one of a seventh-floor apartment in Montreux, Switzerland
Police said the family had become steeped in conspiracy and survivalist theories and withdrawn from society Four members of the same family killed themselves in a suspected collective suicide leap from their seventh-floor apartment
A French family jumped one after another from their apartment in the Swiss town of Montreux, local police investigating the tragic mystery said today
They added that the family appeared to be fervent conspiracy theorists, hoarding food in their apartment
Only a 15-year-old boy survived the tragedy that happened last Thursday in the town on Lake Geneva, and he now remains in a coma in a stable condition in hospital
The Vaud regional police announced that their findings make it possible to rule out the intervention of a third party and suggest that all the victims jumped from the balcony one after the other
They are currently working on the theory of a collective suicide, they said
A 40-year-old man, his 41-year-old wife, her twin sister and the couple’s eight-year-old daughter along with the boy, all took the 20 metre jump from their apartment
France's Journal du Dimanche newspaper said the father, Eric David, grew up in a wealthy part of Marseille and even attended one of France’s most prestigious schools, the Ecole Polytechnique
The twin sisters, Nasrine and Narjisse Feraoun, grew up in a family of five children who were all educated at the elite Lycee Henri-IV in Paris
The mother was a dentist and her sister an ophthalmologist and the newspaper also said the twins were granddaughters of Algerian novelist Mouloud Feraoun
Police said that the family were withdrawn from society before their suicide
Two officers knocked on the apartment door at 6:15am local time, asking to speak to the dad about his son’s homeschool arrangement
However, after a voice asked who was at the door, they said nothing more and officers, unable to enter the apartment, left
Then, less than an hour later, just before 7am, all five leapt from the balcony within the space of five minutes
Police could find no evidence of a struggle, seemingly confirming that all of them jumped of their own accord
A step-ladder was also found on the balcony, where they jumped from
Police said: Before or during the events, no witnesses, including the two police officers present on the spot from 6:15 am and the passers-by at the foot of the building, heard the slightest noise or cry coming from the apartment or the balcony
Technical investigations show no warning signs of such an act
They added that since the start of the pandemic, the family had become increasingly interested in conspiracy and survivalist theories
The family lived in almost complete self-sufficiency, cutting off the outside world
They have amassed a stockpile of food, which took up most of their living space
Only the mother’s twin sister worked outside the home, with neither the mum nor eight-year-old registered with local authorities
Police added that the evidence suggested the family feared authorities interfering with their lives

WARNING DISTRESSING CONTENT Eve Lewis, 15, was a popular and bright student but had struggled with anorexia in the latter part of 2020 in her quest for perfection A teenage girl who dreamed of becoming a lawyer went out for a walk with her dog but sadly never returned
Eve Lewis, 15, was hit by a train after going for a wander with her pet instead of out with her family on September 26 last year
The Lancashire schoolgirl dreamed of becoming a lawyer and was predicted top grades in her GCSEs
A popular pupil, Eve's family say she tried her best in everything and had recently discovered a new passion for both art and drama
They were not worried when she told them she would head out to walk the dog instead of joining them on a trip out last year and, while she battled anorexia, at times becoming painfully thin, relatives thought that she was over the worst of it and had her spark back
There was nothing to suggest that when she went out to walk the dog that day, that she wouldn't be coming home again, her family told LancsLive
There were no cries for help
Eve had so many things to look forward to and so many plans for the future
We don’t believe Eve wanted to die; she wanted to put an end to the torment she was in.  That torment was anorexia
Eve died after being hit by a train and her dog was later found running free in a nearby field by a passer-by
The talented youngster, who was in her final year at Burscough Priory Academy, had developed the eating disorder in the latter part of 2020 in her quest for perfection
Her mum Paula noticed she had lost a considerable amount of weight but, initially, Eve still appeared to be eating normal meals at home in Burscough
However, as 2021 started, and Eve was forced to home-school because of lockdown, she became obsessed with her food intake
By the Easter holidays she wouldn't even allow herself to enjoy the Sunday lunch her mum had made and her weight plummeted to less than six stone
By April 2021 mum Paula, a retired police officer, had become so concerned that she took Eve to see the GP who recorded her weight as just 37kg, or five stone eight pounds
The following day she was called by the eating disorder clinic who advised Eve's parents to not allow her to eat low fat food but after that she just refused to eat at all, her mum said
At an inquest at Preston Coroner's Court today, Paula said: We were told to persevere and we would spend hours every day trying to get her to eat
She would be crying, I would be crying and it was absolutely horrendous
It got to the stage where she was terrified of food
She would hold a fork up to her mouth and her hand would be shaking
In May 2021, as Eve's physical condition deteriorated and she became painfully thin, she attended an appointment with the eating disorder service's practitioners and a GP
The doctor was so worried about Eve's low heart rate, caused by starvation, that he sent her to A&E with her family advised to pack a bag as it was likely she would be admitted
Dr Johnstone told the inquest: I was particularly struck by the terrific efforts of mum and dad who had done everything to try and help her
They spoke of spending six hours a day trying to get her to eat
It was a very clear decision to admit her to hospital because despite all of that she was becoming more and more unwell
When she was admitted to Southport and Ormskirk District General Hospital, 15-year-old Eve weighed 36
55kg - five and a half stone
She was only allowed out of bed in a wheelchair because of her frailty and she told medics that she was worried she would lose control in hospital and become fat
She still had a sense of humour though, mum Paula told the inquest
I remember at one point they asked if she had any allergies and she said 'oil, fat, butter, sugar. . . . ' and was joking
After being warned that she would have to have a nasal feeding tube inserted if she continued to refuse food, Eve slowly began to eat while in hospital
By the time she was discharged, four weeks later, she had gained over 5kg
By September Eve, who was born in Ormskirk, had managed to gain more weight and she was deemed well enough to return to school
She asked her mum if she could have highlights put in her hair and her eyebrows tinted so that if anyone says I look different I can say that's why, Eve told Paula
Headteacher Lucy MacLaren described Eve as a beautiful girl' who loved netball and who contributed in every way possible to the school
See what’s happening near you by entering your postcode below or visit InYourArea The bright student, who could recite Pi to 40 digits, was part of a lovely group of friends who were very supportive
Eve was desperate to get better and had written a list of fear foods such as Ben & Jerry's ice cream and McDonald's, which she and her mum were ticking off one-by-one as she managed to try them
On the morning of Sunday September 26, the family were due to go out but Eve had stayed at home because she was worried a food situation would present itself and she would feel embarrassed
At lunchtime, Eve took the family dog out for a walk near to the train line close to their home in Ainscough Drive and spent 20 minutes talking to a friend on the phone
Emergency services raced to the scene shortly after 1. 35pm
Hayley Bevan was walking over the same trainline crossing and spotted a dog's lead and dog poo bags placed on the ground
She then walked on and saw the Lewis family dog running free

Just before Eve ran across the tracks she posted a heartbreaking message to her friends on Snapchat in which she thanked them for their support, the inquest heard
Assistant Coroner Laura Nash, who cried as she summarised the evidence, returned a conclusion of suicide
She also requested to see the family after the inquest to speak to them privately
After the inquest, Eve's family said in a statement that she had been tormented by anorexia
They said: Eve was just 15 years, one month and eight days’ old when her life ended
All of the superlatives we could come up with would still not do her justice
She was the most caring, loving, funny little girl who was an absolute pleasure to be around
She brought joy into the lives of everyone lucky enough to know her.  Eve was a perfectionist
She did everything to the best of her ability
She should have been taking her GCSEs this year and her grades were predicted to be 8s and 9s
She wanted to be a lawyer
Eve loved sports and exercise, and she was especially good at gymnastics
She enjoyed drama too, and had recently discovered that she was a talented artist
She had a great network of friends and was very popular at school
Unfortunately, in her quest to be perfect, she became anorexic
She was receiving treatment and improving daily
We thought that she was over the worst of it and had her spark back
There was nothing to suggest that when she went out to walk the dog that day, that she wouldn't be coming home again
There were no cries for help
Eve had so many things to look forward to and so many plans for the future
We don’t believe Eve wanted to die; she wanted to put an end to the torment she was in.  That torment was anorexia
Looking back, we believe that as Eve reached a normal weight range, rather than having her appointments with the eating disorder clinic reduced to once a month, she should have continued to be seen and given the opportunity for counselling without a parent present
Medication should also have been considered to help Eve’s mind cope with the changes, as we were told the brain is the last to recover
What is going wrong in our society that makes children and young adults feel they aren't good enough? They are
We wish Eve knew how wonderful she was
She was loved so much, by so many
We believe that Eve didn't tell us how she was feeling as she didn't want to worry or upset us
In her right frame of mind, she would never, ever have done anything to hurt any of us
We wish things could be different
We wish that we could have saved her

Caitlyn McLaughlin, from Scotland, has stripped her son Barry's bedroom and has said it is heartbreaking to see every time she walks past the bare room
She has been battling the council for two years A mum locked in a two year battle with her local council has pleaded with them to refurbish her son's specially-adapted bedroom after being passed from pillar to post over his rare condition
Five-year-old Barry suffers from autism, speech delay and Pica, which causes him to eat materials around him such as wall coverings
Caitlyn McLaughlin, from Scotland, has stripped his bedroom and has said it is heartbreaking to see every time she walks past the bare room, Daily Record reports
The mum said: He had eight different beds during that time and broke every single one of them
It’s been a constant battle
I am not asking for a handout
I just want his room to be safe and if I could afford it myself, I absolutely would pay for it.  It’s just not feasible
A local paper recently announced that West Dunbartonshire Health and Social Care Partnership (WDHSCP) is sitting on £6million of reserves while her son’s room awaits vital work
Caitlyn, who is based in Alexandria said this was a punch to the gut, adding that it took two and half years for her son's specialist bed to arrive
She continues: It has been a long road
When I heard about the money in the reserves it made me really angry
You still want it to be a wee boys’ room but it isn’t like a child’s room
There’s no dignity in it just now
It’s got a bed in it and that’s it
It was even a fight to get the specialist bed and that took two-and-a-half years
I am not asking for a handout
I just want his room to be safe and if I could afford it myself, I absolutely would pay for it.  It’s just not feasible
Caitlyn said the council told her work would be carried out to her son’s room once she moved house, which happened in July 2020
She told how a private contractor had quoted her £12,500 to complete all the work required but says the council told her that was too expensive to fund
She continued: They’ve wallpapered the walls twice but he’s picked it all off
I asked for a plastic wall coating which they’ve now said needs to be done but haven’t agreed yet to do it
He’s eaten the underlay and chews the skirting boards
He also smears up the walls and the carpets and it’s really hard to clean
I am scrubbing it constantly
The lino floor and plastic coating on the walls would make it much easier to clean as there would be no fibres
He only sleeps in there now and even then I’m on constant alert, checking on him making sure he’s not choking on something he’s eaten
It’s heartbreaking – every time I walk past it it’s a constant reminder that it’s not a room you would want your child to grow up in
Caitlyn said she is desperate to get the lino fitted which is sitting in her hall and has even offered to find someone do it herself, explaining: They said they didn’t know if that was allowed
She said the works appear to have been hit with delay after delay, adding: For the first few months I was told that Covid was causing the delay but then it was staff being on annual leave
I’ve also been passed from pillar to post
I feel like I’m not getting anywhere
The Lennox Herald told in February how documents released ahead of a WDHSCP meeting revealed there was £6. 3m in unearmarked reserves
At the time, some residents told how they were also waiting on help, including adaptations
Caitlyn added: It was a punch in the gut seeing how much money they’re sitting on
I know £12,500 is a lot of money but it isn’t compared to the amount sitting there and it would make such a difference to Barry’s life
Dumbarton MSP Jackie Baillie said: It is unacceptable that we are now hearing of more people who have been impacted by this however, sadly, I am not surprised
People are struggling to cope while WDHSCP continue to hold these huge reserves
The hard-working social care staff are doing the best they can but they are not being supported by the WDHSCP and this is having a huge impact on people in need
Beth Culshaw, Chief Officer of WDHSCP said: We are sorry that this resident is unhappy with the service she has received to date
Our commitment is always to improve the lives of people in West Dunbartonshire so we regret that circumstances, including staff absences due to sickness and the Covid-19 pandemic, have caused a delay
We will continue to work closely with the family and we are confident that we will be able to provide the adjustments required

The woman, aged in her 40s, was pronounced dead at the scene after falling from the Park Plaza County Hall hotel in Waterloo one hour after being reported missing last night A woman has died after falling from a hotel window in front of horrified witnesses in central London last night
A police cordon remains in place at the Park Plaza County Hall hotel in Waterloo today after the woman, aged in her 40s, was pronounced dead at the scene
She was seen falling from a window at the hotel around one hour after being reported missing at 10

South Ayrshire Council is looking into claims a seven year-old boy, who is autistic, was left terrifiedafter he was deemed to have been disruptive in the classroom and placed in an isolation room An investigation has been launched after a furious mum claims her autistic son was placed in an isolation room without her knowledge
South Ayrshire Council is looking into claims a seven-year-old boy, who is autistic, was left terrified after he was deemed to have been disruptive in the classroom and was placed in an isolation room
The worried mum, who we are not naming, has withdrawn her boy from the unit, claiming the treatment he suffered was abhorrent, cruel and sadistic, Daily Echo reported
She said: I feel people need to know how our children are treated and changes need to be made
My son was locked in the room for being too vocal and refusing to do a task, which in turn upset the other children
He was not a danger to anyone or himself
Just a regular upset autistic child
Why on earth, is a specialist unit using a locked empty room as a behavioural tool? It’s absolutely abhorrent
I was told he was in there for 15 minutes, a long time to be terrified and screaming for help.  It’s cruel and sadistic
The parent also claimed she knew nothing about the incident until her son came home upset and revealed what happened
She said: I was not notified of this by staff, instead just told 'he had an unsettled morning when asked to complete a task
' He was so upset he told me as soon as he came home
He will not be back (to the unit)
I will be seeking a referral on to somewhere that treats their disabled pupils humanely and values their wellbeing
And I will be making an official complaint with the education department
The unit has written to the mum to apologise that she wasn’t informed her son had accessed the quiet room after he experienced an unsettled morning
They also said it is protocol to call home straight away after any incident
The letter continues: Appropriate forms were completed after the event, sent to the learning and raising standards mailbox and to the inclusion co-ordinator within the correct timeframe for reporting
The letter goes on: These events are then discussed at the Inclusion Monitoring Group and discussions take place as to whether anything can be done differently, or in any additional supports may be needed
This is standard practice for any child who may need to access the quiet room
The school said the child was in the 'quiet space' less than 10 minutes, and supervised by a class assistant at all times
According to the British Psychological Society, the use of isolation booths is not backed by evidence, has been proven not to be effective and breaches the UN convention on the rights of the child
A South Ayrshire Council spokesperson said: A complaint in relation to the allegation has been received and will be investigated and progressed through the council’s complaints process

New research by Deaths by Welfare concludes the Department for Work and Pensions failed to fix systematic flaws in the disability benefits system that potentially led to thousands of deaths You can listen to an audio version of this article here The Government’s failure to act on warnings about its disability benefits systems has been linked to hundreds – maybe even ­thousands – of suicides and other deaths of disabled people
A detailed 160-page study published today exposes how the Department for Work and Pensions was alerted more than 40 times to life-threatening systemic flaws, by academics, coroners and its own researchers over the past 30 years
The Mirror has been given exclusive access to the Deaths by Welfare Timeline, which brings together for the first time the three decades of ­investigations linking DWP and its social security reforms with the deaths of disabled benefit claimants
It documents the DWP’s cumulative harm and slow bureaucratic violence that has led to countless suicides and other deaths, particularly in the post-2010 austerity era
One piece of research connects just one area of the 2010 coalition government’s welfare reforms with an extra 590 suicides between 2010 and 2013
By Rachel Charlton-Dailey, guest editor and founder of The Unwritten Disabled Britain: Doing It For Ourselves, is a week-long series across the Daily Mirror's print and digital platforms, showcasing the lives of disabled people and the issues important to us
The articles have been conceived by disabled people, written by disabled people, and photographs - where possible - taken by disabled people
Throughout this week, we aim to change your mind about how you view disabled people
After all, there are 14 million of us, and we aren’t all the same, it’s time the public stopped listening to lazy stereotypes and viewed disabled people in all our wide-ranging splendor
To read more on The Mirror's week-long series click here Disabled activist Ellen Clifford, author of The War on Disabled People, who provided key input into the Timeline, said it was an enormously important piece of work
She said: Welfare reform has destroyed lives and caused avoidable harm on such a scale that the United Nations made a [2016] finding of grave and systematic violations of ­disabled people’s rights
At the most extreme end this has meant the loss of life
We will probably never know the true number
The culture of dehumanisation and hostility fostered within the DWP to justify the government’s conscious cruelty has meant a complete lack of ­accountability or remorse
The Timeline ­represents an important step in the continuing battle for justice for the victims of welfare reform
Work and pensions ministers have repeatedly been warned of the harm caused by the assessment system, mostly to claimants of out-of-work disability ­benefits such as ­incapacity benefit and employment and support allowance but also the personal independence payment, which was introduced in 2013
As far back as 1995, Professor Nick Wikeley, who would later become an Upper Tribunal judge, was warning new social security legislation would leave marginal groups with ­inadequate protection against the risk of long-term illness
In 2006, Professor Alison Ravetz warned that if the then Labour government was wrong about its proposed incapacity benefit reforms the cost, in stress, to those people and their families will be ­incalculable
Those reforms were rolled out, first under Labour and then – with even harsher restrictions – under Tory-led governments
In March 2010 came the first indication from a coroner the reforms – the work ­capability ­assessment (WCA) and the ­employment and support allowance (ESA) – were having the impact of which Ravetz had warned
Stephen Carré, 41, had taken his life two months earlier after his appeal against being found fit for work was rejected
Coroner Tom Osborne said this trigger led to his suicide, and urged changes to the WCA
In April 2012, Colin Traynor, 29, died following a seizure, after months of growing anxiety about his finances and being wrongly found fit for work
Five months later, Labour’s Michael Meacher became one of the first MPs to speak in parliament about the controversial medical assessments
Sadly, Colin was not an isolated case, he said at the time
Dad Michael O’Sullivan, 60, of North London, took his life in September 2013, again after being found fit for work and ineligible for ESA
He had been claiming incapacity benefit since 2000, due to depression, social anxiety and agoraphobia
To read more content from our week-long series on Disabled Britain click here
In January 2014, coroner Mary Hassell linked his death to the WCA, warning of a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken.  The needless deaths continued. .
Jodey Whiting, 42, took her life in February 2017, after being told by the DWP she had been found fit for work
DWP’s assessors had noted the severity of her mental health ­condition, and the risk posed if she was found fit for work
Two years after her death, the DWP’s Independent Case Examiner found the department had failed five times to follow its safeguarding rules
Errol Graham’s body was discovered by bailiffs who had been sent to evict him in June 2018
He had starved to death, months after DWP wrongly stopped his ESA, and weighed 4st 7lb
In January 2020, Jodey and Errol, 57, were mentioned in the House of Commons with a demand by Labour’s Debbie Abrahams for an independent inquiry
Errol’s daughter-in-law Alison Burton said: It makes us angry and frustrated
You can’t put into words the devastation that department has caused
It just doesn’t seem to care
Debbie Abrahams, a former Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, said: I don’t want any more families like Jodey Whiting’s, Errol Graham’s and hundreds, possibly thousands, more to go through the pain that they have
I have been calling for a public inquiry into the scale and causes of the deaths of social security claimants from 2008 to date
Despite all of this, the ­Government has refused to listen
Claimants continue to lose their lives because of DWP failings
A ­disabled woman, who her family claims was traumatised by the daily demands of the universal credit system, took her life two months ago

Medic Abhijeet Tavare, who joined the world-famous McKinsey management company after graduating, was found by his friends who went looking for him on the middle of the night An Oxford University -trained doctor whose life was shattered when he caught long Covid took his own life because he could not cope with the illness anymore, an inquest heard on Wednesday
The high-flying medic, who joined the world-famous McKinsey management company after graduating, was found by his doctor friends who went looking for him on the middle of the night
A coroner heard that 27-year-old Abhijeet Tavare's mother had returned to their home on London Road, Bushey, Herts, after her usual morning walk, only to realise something was wrong
She went into her son's bedroom and found his suicide notes
In a statement from Abhijeet's GP which was read to the inquest, it was revealed that the son, known as Abhi to friends, had contracted Covid- in September 2020, which he initially recovered from, only for symptoms of long Covid to emerge
The inquest in Hertford was told that he reported he was suffering from palpitations, difficulty sleeping, extreme fatigue, as well as cognitive decline caused by brain fog
The latter meant he could no longer work for the international management consulting company and moved back home with his mother
He had already seen five different doctors and therapists for his physical and mental health issues, all to no avail
He was prescribed sleep medication by his GP and it was recorded in the inquest that no mention of self-harm or suicidal ideation was reported
A statement from police constable Holly Edwards, read: Police received a phone call from Abhijeet's sister-in-law, saying he wasn't in his room and had left notes, saying he could no longer live with his illness and didn't want to suffer anymore
His mum woke up and went for a walk
She got back and noticed he hadn't left his bedroom
She opened his door and he wasn't there
Then she found the letters and immediately called his sister-in-law, who then called police
Officers declared him a high-risk missing person and began a search after finding CCTV of where the car he was driving was last spotted
Meanwhile, his closest friends - all junior doctors - heard the news he was missing and formed a search party
Get the stories you want straight to your inbox
Sign up to one of the Mirror's newsletters The inquest was told that a combination of police investigations and reports, as well as the friends' use of iPhone tracking and bank transaction tracking, led them to an area where he was last believed to have been
His brother, Aniket Tavare said: He was my younger brother
He was a very happy and well-adjusted child
Our dad passed away when he was six years old
He was very sporty and he never let life get in his way
When Covid struck, he stayed with my mum and worked from home
He felt fine for a little bit, but then he started rapidly declining
He was extremely frustrated by this
When I last saw him he was very different - we couldn't really talk about anything as his life was on pause
There were no specific mental health concerns - we knew he was down, but that was more for his circumstances
I thought he would ride it out like every other challenge he faced in life
He will be missed by a lot of people
Concluding the inquest, assistant Hertfordshire coroner Jonathan Stevens said: Abhi Tavare was an extremely talented man
He had been to Oxford University and had excelled
He had a very tight-knit group of friends
He was due to be best man at one of their weddings in the following year
He was an exceptionally talented person
He contracted long Covid and that presented him with a dramatic change to his life
He had seen numerous consultants to no avail
Once he was declared missing, the response from his friends was quite overwhelming
He recorded the death as suicide

Mum-of-two, Tinuke Awe, says there is a huge lack of representation in educational resources about autism for children
Now, she's on a mission to release her very own children's book to prove that diversity in books can help break the stigma against autism
Publishers have been criticised for ignoring Black children in books about autism
Mum-of-two, Tinuke Awe, is now writing her own book after failing to find any literature to support her son when he was diagnosed with autism
Black pupils are reported to have the highest rate of autism in the UK, being 26% more likely to have autism than their white counterparts
Yet, a study by Centre for Literacy in Primary Education (CLPE) reported only 7% of the children’s books published in the UK over the last three years featured characters of colour
Ms Awe wants her book to help tackle the stigmas and taboos about the condition
She said: What a lot of people don't know is the prevalence of autism is higher in black children
And those are only the diagnoses that we actually know about
What about the ones that are in denial, the ones that are not seeking help, the ones that are still going through the process and still waiting for a diagnosis
I just want everyone to know that autism is not a bad thing
Because there's this lack of awareness
Some of the Black community just assume it's a bad thing, she said
Ms Awe's son, Ezekiel, was diagnosed with autism last year in June and was the first member in her family to have autism
While looking for resources, Ms Awe realised the lack of representation of black characters with special needs in children's books
My son is almost five
So four, five years ago, there were a few books but there weren't really any educational [autism] resources, she said
So like posters and flashcards and things that you would use outside of books
And I looked and I thought, ‘what is going on?’
How come there's such a lack of representation of black children?
Ms Awe says the lack of educational materials is reinforcing the stigmas and taboos around autism
Only 7% of books published in 2020 had minority ethnics as the main character, that's even less for black people and even less for a black person with special needs, she said
If a child is old enough to read or listen to a book, then they're old enough for us to start teaching them about differences and autism, she said
Ms Awe says the book will take inspiration from her son and his friends to show autism is not something to fear
I think first and foremost, it's important to introduce Ezekiel as the main character and his traits so that they can look out for them and understand that he has strengths and weaknesses just like anybody else, she said
So non-autistic children might be good at maths and maybe not so good at P. E
Ezekiel might be good at ordering things but he's not so good at speaking
I want to show that autism is not something to fear and it's not someone to be scared of
It's just a difference, she said
And whilst Ms Awe hopes her book can educate children, she wants adults as well to be able to learn something about autism
I say the book is for children, but honestly it's a book for adults as well
It's about the children, but it's about the adults as well, she said
Because when adults don't understand and they can't adequately explain it to the children, then they just continue to build a generation of people who are kind of ignorant
So what I'm planning to do is have a section at the end for adults, with talking points and questions that they can ask
Telling them about what autism means, and how to be around someone if they are showing traits, she said
Ms Awe says when she found out about her son's diagnosis, she felt both scared and relieved
It was a scary time
This time last year I was a completely different person
I put my hands up and say, I didn't know enough about it
I knew a little bit because of my background but it's different when it's your child, she said
But it also felt like a wave of relief because it's like, I can finally explain his behaviours and I can get him adequate support, she said
With her website, Mums and Tea, which she started in 2017, Ms Awe says she's been able to share her experience with other mums
I have so many Black mums and Black parents on my platform who are going through the same thing and don’t even know where to start, she said
They have seen the signs and are a bit worried or burying their head under the sand and are in denial because autism is still such a taboo subject in the Black community
Her story has encouraged others to come out and share their experience in raising children with autism, inspiring those who would once shy away from the subject
She said: A mum sent me a message that literally almost brought me to tears
She said, ‘God bless you
As many walk your shoes, but don't have the courage to do what you're doing
Instead they just suffer in silence, but you've broken so many barriers and you allow people to feel safe and you fill a gap that was so needed
’ When you hear things like, how could I not keep going?, she said
Ms Awe is now fundraising to have the book self published, with £3,000 raised out of her £18,000 goal

Get email updates with the day's biggest stories Mum-of-two, Tinuke Awe, says there is a huge lack of representation in educational resources about autism for children
Now, she's on a mission to release her very own children's book to prove that diversity in books can help break the stigma against autism
Publishers have been criticised for ignoring Black children in books about autism
Mum-of-two, Tinuke Awe, is now writing her own book after failing to find any literature to support her son when he was diagnosed with autism
Black pupils are reported to have the highest rate of autism in the UK, being 26% more likely to have autism than their white counterparts
Yet, a study by Centre for Literacy in Primary Education (CLPE) reported only 7% of the children’s books published in the UK over the last three years featured characters of colour
Ms Awe wants her book to help tackle the stigmas and taboos about the condition
She said: What a lot of people don't know is the prevalence of autism is higher in black children
And those are only the diagnoses that we actually know about
What about the ones that are in denial, the ones that are not seeking help, the ones that are still going through the process and still waiting for a diagnosis
I just want everyone to know that autism is not a bad thing
Because there's this lack of awareness
Some of the Black community just assume it's a bad thing, she said
Ms Awe's son, Ezekiel, was diagnosed with autism last year in June and was the first member in her family to have autism
While looking for resources, Ms Awe realised the lack of representation of black characters with special needs in children's books
My son is almost five
So four, five years ago, there were a few books but there weren't really any educational [autism] resources, she said
So like posters and flashcards and things that you would use outside of books
And I looked and I thought, ‘what is going on?’
How come there's such a lack of representation of black children?
Ms Awe says the lack of educational materials is reinforcing the stigmas and taboos around autism
Only 7% of books published in 2020 had minority ethnics as the main character, that's even less for black people and even less for a black person with special needs, she said
If a child is old enough to read or listen to a book, then they're old enough for us to start teaching them about differences and autism, she said
Ms Awe says the book will take inspiration from her son and his friends to show autism is not something to fear
I think first and foremost, it's important to introduce Ezekiel as the main character and his traits so that they can look out for them and understand that he has strengths and weaknesses just like anybody else, she said
So non-autistic children might be good at maths and maybe not so good at P. E
Ezekiel might be good at ordering things but he's not so good at speaking
I want to show that autism is not something to fear and it's not someone to be scared of
It's just a difference, she said
And whilst Ms Awe hopes her book can educate children, she wants adults as well to be able to learn something about autism
I say the book is for children, but honestly it's a book for adults as well
It's about the children, but it's about the adults as well, she said
Because when adults don't understand and they can't adequately explain it to the children, then they just continue to build a generation of people who are kind of ignorant
So what I'm planning to do is have a section at the end for adults, with talking points and questions that they can ask

Lucy Beaumont tells how her mum was diagnosed with several neurodivergent conditions during lockdown, but the time allowed her to figure out why she had found certain things so challenging With all the talk of Partygate and the Sue Gray report this week, it feels a bit like time to reflect on the past two years and how Covid, lockdown and the return to a new normal have affected each of us differently
There’s no question what went on in No10 in that hardest of times was wrong
But as I look back at the pandemic, for the first time now I’m able to see what me and my family have gained from it
During lockdown my mum, at the age of 65, was diagnosed with high-functioning female Aspergers, ADHD and alexithymia
You might never have heard of the last condition, which affects how you express and process emotion, but one in 10 people are reported to have it
The diagnosis only came about because the world slowed down
Lockdown allowed me and my mum to reflect on how she struggles in certain situations – and excels in others
More and more women in particular are being diagnosed with neurodiversities later in life, with celebrities such as Christine McGuinness and Melanie Sykes talking openly about it in recent months
And sometimes just having a diagnosis is enough to start making sense of yourself
For Mum, the feelings of guilt, of not fitting in, being sometimes seen as rude or badly behaved, means life has been a roller coaster
These feelings have been replaced with a sense of living beyond survival mode
I instantly took to the internet to find guidance and support for myself, being an adult child of an autistic parent
My mum is extremely caring and protective over me, if anything she’s overly empathetic
It must have been hard for her as a single parent
We have gone through a lot, the past is in the past, but the diagnosis triggered a lot of emotional feelings for me
I feel I had more advantages than disadvantages as the child of a mum with Asperger’s but kids can feel overlooked or have to act like the parent

Our story is unique to us and is not a comment on others and their abilities to be neurodiverse and a parent
But it would be great to see radical change in this area and support for children, alongside a reduction in NHS waiting times for diagnosis
If only someone could have sat down my eight-year-old self to explain to me why my mum found life so difficult and that it wasn’t my fault
Gosh, I hope the support improves

There was no note or any evidence to suggest army gunner Sophie Madden, 23, had planned to take her own life but coroner Katrina Hepburn returned a verdict of suicide There was no indication that a mum who was found hanged in an army shower block had planned to take her own life, an inquest has heard
Army gunner Sophie Madden, 23, originally from Wigan in Lancashire, was found dead in the shower block of the Saint Martin's Plain Army Training Centre in Folkestone, Kent
The mum-of-one had been on a night out with friends and colleagues the evening before her death, visiting a number of Folkestone pubs and playing pool in the barracks’ bar before heading to bed at around 1am on June 10
Sophie, a gunner in the British Army’s third Regiment Royal Horse Artillery, was seen heading towards the shower block shortly after, but this was considered normal as she often showered before bed
The next morning at around 9
30am a colleague went to the shower block and saw Ms Madden's belongings on a bench outside her preferred cubicle
She looked under the door and saw Ms Madden's legs, which raised the alarm, and once the cubicle door was opened it was found Ms Madden had hanged herself, the inquest in Maidstone heard on Monday
A report by Detective Sergeant Andrew West of Kent Police of the police investigation into Sophie’s death found no signs of third party involvement or criminal activity
The inquest heard there is no evidence she was expecting anyone to come in to the shower block and did not tell anyone she was feeling in any way suicidal, or made anyone aware of any issues when she went in
A toxicology report found she had 173mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood in her system, more than double the drink-drive limit, but friends who went out with her the night before said she had drunk less than she usually would
Ms Madden had no ongoing physical health issues, according to her GP, and she was not known to local mental health services
She had been placed on a vulnerability register by the Army in 2020 after she was seen hitting her head against a wall after drinking alcohol, but after two years of observation and weekly check-ups she was removed from the list in 2022
Colleagues said there were rumours Ms Madden had self-harmed and had a difficult upbringing, and in 2020 she was the victim of an alleged assault by the father of her son Jayden - however she declined to support a prosecution

One of Ms Madden's four sisters, Chantelle, spoke to her just hours before she took her own life and in her police statement said the news of Sophie's death was a total surprise and that Ms Madden was so well loved
She said Ms Madden had claimed she was stressed that her phone was broken and she did not have the money to fix it, and also that she was facing a bill for damages caused by her pet dog at her previous Army accommodation
In a statement, her sister said: Sophie was a strong, independent woman, and didn't tend to worry about things
I told her I'd send her some money and a spare phone the next day, but I didn't have any concerns for her safety or mental health
There was no note or any evidence to suggest premeditation, but coroner Katrina Hepburn returned a verdict of suicide at the inquest held in County Hall, Maidstone on Monday
The coroner explained: I'm satisfied it was Sophie who did the act . .
and there is no evidence of anyone else being involved
I have to consider whether Sophie intended to take her own life or if it was a cry for help
There is no evidence she was expecting anyone to come in and didn't tell anyone she was feeling in any way suicidal, or made anyone aware of any issues when she went in
I am satisfied she did in fact intend to take her own life, and satisfied all other scenarios have been ruled out
Therefore a conclusion of suicide is needed on the balance of probability

Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition with potentially 'devastating' consequences - but families affected have felt largely 'unsupported' Health watchdog NICE has revealed a landmark initiative today to vastly improve the care of those exposed to alcohol in the womb
Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) affects around 3% of the UK population - three times as many as autism - yet more than half of Brits (53%) have never heard of the condition
FASD is a neurodevelopmental condition that arises from alcohol exposure in the womb, with 428 associated conditions linked to devastating consequences - from brain damage to physical and developmental issues
Today, The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) said that any child thought to have been exposed should be given an assessment
Any child confirmed to have been exposed should be sent for a neurodevelopmental assessment, and those confirmed to have FASD should be given a management plan for their needs
It also said women should be given early advice not to drink in their pregnancy, and have their alcohol consumption noted on records
This is part of a 20-year fight by campaigners and families living with FASD, who feel they have been largely unsupported
The spokeswoman for National Organisation for FASD, Joanna Buckard, said: The NICE Quality Standard is a major leap forward in the fight to reduce alcohol-exposed pregnancies by giving women the information and support they need and, vitally, to create brighter futures for those with FASD and their families
Too many people with FASD up to now have been left undiagnosed and unsupported, with sometimes devastating and avoidable consequences
Professor Raja Mukherjee, who heads the FASD National Specialist Clinic and was on the NICE Quality Standard Committee, said: FASD is a complex condition which affects brain and body
There are over 428 conditions linked to FASD, and it presents in multiple ways
But in terms of recognition, we’re about 20 years behind other conditions like autism or ADHD
I hope it does not take so long going forward to implement the improvements outlined in the NICE Quality Standard, and make the real difference that people with FASD deserve.  Despite 2
4 million people thought to have FASD in the UK, compared to the 1 million people estimated to be living with autism, the majority of Brits (66%) have heard of autism
A third (32%) who knew about FASD didn't know how many people were living with it, while almost half (46%) estimated the figures to be lower than it is
It comes as research, carried out by OnePoll, on behalf of the National Organisation for FASD, found nearly a quarter of adults think it’s okay to have alcohol during pregnancy - which goes against the Chief Medical Officer's advice that it is safest to avoid it
What is happening where you live? Find out by adding your postcode
Jan Griffin, from Surrey, whose 20-year-old son Rossi has FASD, opened up about her experience
She said: I didn’t have any issues with alcohol
I was just an ordinary 40-year-old woman living my best life as it were
Had anybody said to me, when I was thinking of having a sleeping tablet or a tot of brandy to de-stress, did you know alcohol kills cells as they migrate in the baby?, I’d have sat up and made different decisions
I wish someone had said - this is what happens, these are the facts, the choice is yours, you’re not being judged
We cannot change the history of FASD, but with this long-awaited NICE Quality Standard we WILL change futures
Rossi said: I’m very forgetful, oftentimes I have trouble socialising and sometimes it’s a comfort issue - I may get back or leg pains
Clare Devanney-Glynn, adoptive mum to three with FASD, who also sat on the NICE Quality Standard Committee, said: Thanks to this, my children and others just like them will be able to enter adulthood being understood by society in a way that just hasn’t ever happened before
This has the capacity to change what our entire society looks like for the better

Catalin Micu, 54, killed mum-of-one Ramona Stoia, 35, in a suspected murder-suicide on April 11 in at their tattoo studio called GothInk Studio in Canterbury, Kent A tattoo artist stabbed his wife to death in an unprovoked attack before turning the knife on himself in the studio where they worked, an inquest heard today
Catalin Micu, 54, killed mum-of-one Ramona Stoia, 35, in a suspected murder-suicide on April 11 in Canterbury, Kent
Not long after their deaths it came out that Micu was facing allegations he raped Ramona multiple times throughout their marriage
The couple has a young child together
Micu was on police bail when he was found dead at their GothInk Studio with Ramona
Micu died from a stab wound to the stomach, an inquest into his death at County Hall in Maidstone, Kent heard
An earlier hearing this week heard Ramona suffered a knife wound to her neck
Coroner Katrina Hepburn said Micu killed his wife before he was seen going behind a curtain before his death
Before the apparent murder-suicide, Micu was interviewed by police after his wife accused him of multiple sexual assaults against her
Kent Police then referred itself to police watchdog the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) following its contact with the couple before their deaths
The IPOC has since confirmed it will not be investigating and the force will be left to carry out its own probe into the handling of the case
The watchdog added that it will scrutinise the results of the internal investigation
On April 11, dozens of armed police swooped in at the studio at about 5
20pm, where they found the couple dead
Detectives are not looking for anyone else in connection to their deaths
Ramona's is being treated as suspicious and Micu's is not, police said
Ramona's death led to an outpouring of tributes, where she was a well-known tattoo artist in the community
A collage of pictures of Ramona has since been put up on the doors of the shop, along with dozens of flowers, candles and written tributes
One heartfelt poem, called Shining Star, reads: A shining star snatched from our sky
The question we ask ourselves is why? A wonderful spirit loved by all
An amazing lady so beautiful
Taken by the angels in such a cruel way
So heartbroken can't find the words to say
The tattoos you created are your legacy
Up in heaven now spirit flying free
A tribute left at the scene reads: RIP Ramona
You were a beautiful soul
You will be missed so much
Another says: I never knew you but unfortunately can relate to your experiences
You deserved to be here and free of violence
I hope you have some sense of peace
In February, Ramona secured a non-molestation order - a court injunction restricting or banning contact - against Micu
The tattoo artists married in Las Vegas four years ago but are understood to have recently separated
It is thought the couple - who have a young son - continued to live together, but Micu was banned from harassing or pestering her
On March 26, Micu was arrested on suspicion of having breached this order, and of seriously sexually assaulting his wife
Ramona came forward with a series of historic allegations of rape against her husband, dating back throughout their 16-year relationship but primarily taking place in the last few years
There were five separate allegations, all of which reportedly took place at the family home
Following his arrest, Micu was placed on police bail until April 20
Anyone who has any concerns or information regarding the incident is asked to contact the police via the Kent Police website or by calling 101, quoting 11-0995, or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111

So heartbroken can't find the words to say
The tattoos you created are your legacy
Up in heaven now spirit flying free
A tribute left at the scene reads: RIP Ramona
You were a beautiful soul
You will be missed so much
Another says: I never knew you but unfortunately can relate to your experiences
You deserved to be here and free of violence
I hope you have some sense of peace
In February, Ramona secured a non-molestation order - a court injunction restricting or banning contact - against Micu
The tattoo artists married in Las Vegas four years ago but are understood to have recently separated
It is thought the couple - who have a young son - continued to live together, but Micu was banned from harassing or pestering her
On March 26, Micu was arrested on suspicion of having breached this order, and of seriously sexually assaulting his wife
Ramona came forward with a series of historic allegations of rape against her husband, dating back throughout their 16-year relationship but primarily taking place in the last few years
There were five separate allegations, all of which reportedly took place at the family home
Following his arrest, Micu was placed on police bail until April 20
Anyone who has any concerns or information regarding the incident is asked to contact the police via the Kent Police website or by calling 101, quoting 11-0995, or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111

Nathan Hunt's dad Derek says new evidence found his son - who served with Prince Harry - was deeply traumatised by a Taliban attack that killed and seriously wounded 10 Afghan soldiers The family of a war hero who served alongside Prince Harry claim new evidence shows that their son’s suicide was linked to combat service
Warrant Officer Nathan Hunt’s parents are campaigning to have his name added to the memorial at the National Arboretum in Staffordshire
So far defence chiefs have refused to budge on their ruling that his death was not linked to his service in Afghanistan 10 years before
Now the family have discovered he was deeply traumatised by a Taliban rocket attack which killed and seriously wounded up to 10 Afghan soldiers
The carnage happened in December 2007 during the ferocious battle for the town of Musa Qala in Helmand
The report states that Nathan and another soldier tried and failed to save the lives of Afghan soldiers
Nathan’s dad Derek, himself an Army veteran, said: I received this report last week and it shows beyond doubt that Nathan was seriously traumatised by the war
He had nightmares and was really struggling
He had to deal with Afghan soldiers who had been blown to pieces or who had lost limbs
Anyone who witnessed that sort of thing would be seriously affected by it
This seems to have been ignored by people who decided that Nathan should not have his name on the war memorial
Or, worse still, they had no idea this happened to Nathan
Nathan was found hanged at his home in Lincoln aged 39 on January 2, 2018, after developing PTSD
He left behind a young daughter
An inquest seven months later heard he had suffered nightmares as a result of dealing with Taliban bombs
A recently acquired transcript reveals that his ex-wife Lainey was convinced he had PTSD after returning from Afghanistan in 2008
But he refused to get help because he was fearful of the impact it might have on his promotion chances
Derek added: I will be taking this up with the new Veterans’ Minister Johnny Mercer when I meet with him next month
There is now so much evidence showing that Nathan was obviously in a bad way after he returned from Afghanistan
I just can’t understand why this has all been ignored
Nathan served with Harry in Helmand in 2008 while attached to the Household Cavalry

Prince Harry wrote to the couple telling of his dismay at not being able to help after being stripped of his military titles

Cassie Lee from Mold, Flintshire, claims Sychdyn Riding School refused to allow her daughter Maddie to have horse riding lessons because she is autistic, with the school claiming it was down to its insurance policy A furious mum claims her daughter was refused a horse riding lesson because her autism was too bad
Cassie Lee, from Mold, Flintshire, said her 14-year-old daughter Maddie was turned down because of her additional needs
The heartbroken mum-of-three said a member of staff at Sychdyn Riding School asked how bad Maddie's autism was before refusing to allow the booking
Cassie said the incident is a painful reminder how people with disabilities are still not treated equally, North Wales Live reports
Sychdyn Riding School told North Wales Live it was necessary to access Maddie's disability due to insurance concerns to ensure the safety of staff and customers
A spokesperson for the school, based near Mold, added: We have to consider everyone's safety, there's protocol we have to follow, and if people have different needs we have to factor that in, we don't want to put anyone at risk
We've never come up against this in all the years
We're not discriminating, we're just sticking to within the law
However, Cassie claims it was direct discrimination and showed a lack of empathy for people with special needs
She added: I'm heartbroken, if I'm honest
I'm hurt because I've had to watch my little girl upset because she couldn't go, just because she's autistic
People these days say people with autism are accepted but we face struggles every day and no one sees that side of things
It's really upsetting that people just write her off because everyone who knows Maddie loves her and knows how great she is, people on the street say 'hiya' to her before me because she's so popular
Maddie's autism means she communicates and expresses her emotions differently to others
But Cassie said this is no reason for her daughter to miss out on things other children get to do
Cassie said the riding school had been willing to take the booking when Maddie's dad, Danny Brockley, had called on March 23
But things changed when they learnt of Maddie's autism, Cassie claims
She said: Maddie's dad called up first and spoke to someone and it was all fine but when he mentioned she had autism they said they couldn't do it
They said it should be no problem until he explained that Maddie has autism and she might get excited when she sees the horses, and then they said she couldn't come
Maddie stims which means she flaps her arms and makes noises when she gets excited but that's just how she reacts and she shouldn't be treated differently to anyone else
The mum-of-three added: What upset me the most was how dismissive they were, it's like they heard the word autism and made their minds up
They kept asking 'how bad is it? How bad is her autism?,' But it's not bad, autism isn't something bad it's just different
I just want my little girl to be able to do what she enjoys
The devastated mum added she would not have allowed her daughter on a horse if it wasn't safe
But Sychdyn Riding School said they needed different insurance to work with Maddie safely, and recommended Clwyd Special Riding Centre, which specialises in riding for people with additional needs
A spokesperson said: We're just trying to stick within the rules that have been given to us, and there are places available which are specifically set up for people with different needs
On the insurance explanation, she said: They did come back after and explain to me about the insurance, but the thing that hurt me was the way they approached it, because it felt like she was just being told no because of her autism
In this day and age, people who were born with disabilities are still not treated the same and not able to do the same things as other people
She added: We have spoken to other parents with ASD and did consider others but we ended up going to a riding school in Flintshire, which doesn't specialise in disabilities
I'm glad we found a school who understood her

Disability Rights UK (DR UK) said they should have made reasonable adjustments to ensure Maddie could ride
Fazilet Hadi, head of policy at leading equality charity DR UK claimed the riding school's actions: The Equality Act is clear that reasonable adjustments must be made for people with disabilities
Laws have been in place for over 25 years to allow Disabled people to take part in mainstream activities with non-disabled people
It would appear that Maddie has no additional needs that require anything more than a little time for her to adjust to being around the horses
All the riding school needed to do was to adopt a can-do attitude and let her ride the horse

Forklift driver Barry Douglas, 44, and friend Claire Vickers, 46, appeared on ITV's This Morning in wheelchairs to talk about the accident which left them with life-changing injuries A man left in a wheelchair after a drunken waterpark accident took his own life just six months later, an inquest heard
Forklift driver Barry Douglas, 44, broke both his legs after sneaking into the lido with a friend at 2am and crashing into the barrier of a closed flume tube
The life-changing injuries left Barry, from Dundee, unable to work as he could not drive, forcing him to move house
The hearing in Winchester, heard that Barry, had moved to Aldershot with his stepfather at the age of 20 and had set up a stable life for himself
Despite some signs his condition was improving, Scottish-born Douglas took his own life in his studio flat in February of this year, the inquest was told
The Glasgow Rangers fan had been working as a forklift truck driver up until the time of his accident on the water slide
The inquest heard that in August 2021 having consumed a considerable amount of alcohol, Barry made the impulsive decision with Claire to break into Aldershot Lido
When the pair went down the water slide they slammed into a steel barrier that was blocking the end and sustained serious injuries
Reports at the time said they were then trapped for two hours before being rescued
Both Barry and friend, Claire Vickers, 46, appeared on ITV's This Morning in wheelchairs to talk about the incident
The inquest was also told that Douglas had a history of taking recreational drugs including cocaine and heroine
He had also spent a short time drug dealing and was stabbed in 2011, the inquest heard
Barry began experiencing a low mood and was known to drink between 500ml-1L of vodka a day, the inquest was told
His GP told the hearing that he had been prescribed anti-depressants following his lido accident
His mother, Ruth Douglas told the inquest that he had been desperate to get back to work after the accident
She added that doctors had told Barry that it might take up to two years to get his mobility back and that he was worried about being crippled
Barry's friends, having not heard from him for several days, contacted his tenant welfare officer who found him hanged in his flat in Aldershot in February 2022, the inquest heard
A post-mortem report read to the court stated that Barry had consumed a significant amount of alcohol before his death
Senior Coroner for Hampshire Christopher Wilkinson said that there was 'no clear explanation' for why Barry took his own life
Mr Wilkinson: He set himself up here in the UK
He started to consume alcohol to a greater extent and had been using street drugs
His [water slide] injuries were, in my opinion, life-changing
In his last few days there had been some hope that he was returning to work and was driving again
There was also a possibility that he was moving to other accommodation
It's regrettable that I cannot establish what he was thinking
He took his own life impulsively under the influence of alcohol, Mr Wilkinson added
The coroner recorded a conclusion of suicide

Kiena Dawes, 23, asked the police for help just weeks before she left her nine-month-old daughter with a close friend and took her own life, with Lancashire Constabulary referring itself to a police watchdog An alleged domestic abuse victim and mum of-one who tragically killed herself on train tracks was let down by the police, her family have claimed today
Kiena Dawes, 23, had left her nine-month-old daughter, Marnie, with a close friend just hours before she was hit by a train and pronounced dead at the scene last Friday
The tragedy happened 11 days after she was allegedly assaulted by a man who her family said she should have been protected from by the police
In a touching tribute, her brother, Kynan, 29, called Kiena an amazing young girl and said that the bubbly mum had just wanted a happy life
But he also revealed shocking new photos showing her looking bloodied and bruised following an alleged assault after police had fitted panic alarms in her home
Speaking today, Kynan blasted Lancashire Constabulary after it emerged the force had referred itself to a police watchdog due to their contact with Kiena before her death
The builder from Blackpool, Lancs, said: The police have let my sister down
They did not do enough
The head of CID is going to go through everything with a toothpick
They're going to find out why nothing happened, and why it got to the point where she felt she wasn't being looked after by the service, which she should be, and decided to take her life
She had panic alarms fitted in her house and a panic alarm fitted around her neck
My sister left a note before she killed herself, on her phone
The facts why she killed herself are stated in that note
In time, that may get shared but not now
He added: The girl was very, very well loved
She never said a bad word about anybody
She just wanted to live a happy little life
Kiena's body was recovered from train tracks near the town of Garstang, Lancs, as friends and family conducted a frantic search for her in nearby streets and alleyways
But before they could locate the missing 23-year-old, they got the terrible news that her body had been found on a rail line just after 1pm, on Friday
Kynan claimed the young woman had sought the help of police roughly five weeks earlier, following allegations that she'd been assaulted on multiple occasions
He said Lancashire Police had fitted her home with a panic alarm and given her a special neckless that had a button she could press if she felt like she was in danger
But Kynan said this hadn't stop her attacker coming to her home on July 11, before he allegedly split her head open, leaving her completely traumatised
And he said the local police should have done more to help her as she attempted to bring her alleged attacker to court
He said: The police have let my sister down, they have
She wanted to go through the legal route to get justice
The girl is dead now, but it should have gone to CPS ages ago
She didn't want to live a life the way she was living, so she ended it
Kynan said his sister had spent her early life growing up in Cyprus before moving to the UK, and later settling in Fleetwood, Lancs
He said she had then trained as a hairdresser and began working at a local shop and had absolutely loved her job
He said: Kiena was the most amazing little girl from when she was first born
She was very bubbly, very nice.  We moved to Cyprus
She used to speak fluent Greek
She had loads of friends in Cyprus
And then we moved back to the UK as my dad had an accident, which did knock her.  She was a hairdresser
She used to work at Rory Blair in Fleetwood
She absolutely loved her job, she was really good at it
She loved having a tan
She would go on the sun beds all the time
All the sun bed shops have been in touch saying, 'We'll miss her, she used to come in
' She was just amazing
A spokesperson for British Transport Police confirmed that Kiena had passed away on a train line and added that they were not treating the death as suspicious

This incident is not being treated as suspicious and a file will be prepared for the coroner
' A spokesperson for Lancashire Constabulary confirmed that the force had referred itself to the IOPC (Independent Office for Police Conduct) due to their contact with Kiena
They said: First and foremost our thoughts are with Kiena's loved ones at this difficult time
We have referred ourselves to the IOPC (Independent Office for Police Conduct) in relation to contact we had with Kiena before her death
Therefore, it would be inappropriate to comment any further at this time

Jada Braxton, 17, was diagnosed with autism when she was seven after her mum Danisha noticed changes to her behaviour and an intense need to stick to a routine
But the devoted mum has never let autism hold her daughter back A teen with autism has been crowned a beauty queen - after judges saw just a photograph of her
Jada Braxton, 17, won the Miss Photogenic title at the Miss Saraland pageant in her home state of Alabama, US
Diagnosed with autism aged seven, she struggles to look people in the eye and submitted her entry to the pageant with a stunning photo of herself beaming
Now wearing her title with pride, Jada wants other autistic girls to know that they have a voice
After her daughter's big win, Jada's mum Danisha said the verdict was outstanding given that the judges only used a photo of her
She said: By her winning Miss Photogenic, she is a face now to autism
This is autism, this is what autism looks like
For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here Proud Danisha also wrote about Jada's success on Instagram, posting a heartfelt message to her daughter
She wrote: You refuse to be labelled
You refuse to be held to limits
Danisha added she reckoned the judges would be shocked if they knew the person they'd chosen as Miss Photogenic had special needs
She recalled a chat she'd had with Jada about entering a beauty pageant in a heartwarming exchange
Danisha reported her daughter said: Mom I want other autistic girls to know that they can do this too
Describing her daughter as a shining light, she praised Jada for showing people that those living with special needs just want to be included and accepted
She wrote: You are truly LOVE
You are an inspiration to so many people
You do not let your autism stop you from dreaming and achieving
It is such an honour and a blessing to be your mum
The outpouring love and support that she has received this past week has been AMAZING
From the bottom of our hearts. .
Jada and I thank you all

knows that she is more than just a girl with autism
Recalling what her daughter was like as a tot, Danisha said Jada knew all her colours and could count to 100 before starting school
But one day, out of nowhere, she stopped being able to count to 10 and couldn't sing the alphabet
She also wanted to do everything according to a strict routine, and if that routine wasn't followed it led to a complete meltdown
Danisha wrote: I’m not talking about your typical toddler temper tantrum
I knew then that something was wrong
After Jada received her diagnosis, Danisha sought out occupational, nutritional and speech therapy to help her daughter reach milestones
She wrote: Ten years later, all the therapy helped tremendously
The best advice that I would give to other parents is to do the research

Caitlyn McLaughlin, from Scotland, has stripped her son Barry's bedroom and has said it is heartbreaking to see every time she walks past the bare room
She has been battling the council for two years A mum locked in a two year battle with her local council has pleaded with them to refurbish her son's specially-adapted bedroom after being passed from pillar to post over his rare condition
Five-year-old Barry suffers from autism, speech delay and Pica, which causes him to eat materials around him such as wall coverings
Caitlyn McLaughlin, from Scotland, has stripped his bedroom and has said it is heartbreaking to see every time she walks past the bare room, Daily Record reports
The mum said: He had eight different beds during that time and broke every single one of them
It’s been a constant battle
I am not asking for a handout
I just want his room to be safe and if I could afford it myself, I absolutely would pay for it.  It’s just not feasible
A local paper recently announced that West Dunbartonshire Health and Social Care Partnership (WDHSCP) is sitting on £6million of reserves while her son’s room awaits vital work
Caitlyn, who is based in Alexandria said this was a punch to the gut, adding that it took two and half years for her son's specialist bed to arrive
She continues: It has been a long road
When I heard about the money in the reserves it made me really angry
You still want it to be a wee boys’ room but it isn’t like a child’s room
There’s no dignity in it just now
It’s got a bed in it and that’s it
It was even a fight to get the specialist bed and that took two-and-a-half years
I am not asking for a handout
I just want his room to be safe and if I could afford it myself, I absolutely would pay for it.  It’s just not feasible
Caitlyn said the council told her work would be carried out to her son’s room once she moved house, which happened in July 2020
She told how a private contractor had quoted her £12,500 to complete all the work required but says the council told her that was too expensive to fund
She continued: They’ve wallpapered the walls twice but he’s picked it all off
I asked for a plastic wall coating which they’ve now said needs to be done but haven’t agreed yet to do it
He’s eaten the underlay and chews the skirting boards
He also smears up the walls and the carpets and it’s really hard to clean
I am scrubbing it constantly
The lino floor and plastic coating on the walls would make it much easier to clean as there would be no fibres
He only sleeps in there now and even then I’m on constant alert, checking on him making sure he’s not choking on something he’s eaten
It’s heartbreaking – every time I walk past it it’s a constant reminder that it’s not a room you would want your child to grow up in
Caitlyn said she is desperate to get the lino fitted which is sitting in her hall and has even offered to find someone do it herself, explaining: They said they didn’t know if that was allowed
She said the works appear to have been hit with delay after delay, adding: For the first few months I was told that Covid was causing the delay but then it was staff being on annual leave
I’ve also been passed from pillar to post
I feel like I’m not getting anywhere
The Lennox Herald told in February how documents released ahead of a WDHSCP meeting revealed there was £6. 3m in unearmarked reserves
At the time, some residents told how they were also waiting on help, including adaptations
Caitlyn added: It was a punch in the gut seeing how much money they’re sitting on
I know £12,500 is a lot of money but it isn’t compared to the amount sitting there and it would make such a difference to Barry’s life
Dumbarton MSP Jackie Baillie said: It is unacceptable that we are now hearing of more people who have been impacted by this however, sadly, I am not surprised
People are struggling to cope while WDHSCP continue to hold these huge reserves
The hard-working social care staff are doing the best they can but they are not being supported by the WDHSCP and this is having a huge impact on people in need
Beth Culshaw, Chief Officer of WDHSCP said: We are sorry that this resident is unhappy with the service she has received to date
Our commitment is always to improve the lives of people in West Dunbartonshire so we regret that circumstances, including staff absences due to sickness and the Covid-19 pandemic, have caused a delay
We will continue to work closely with the family and we are confident that we will be able to provide the adjustments required

Charlie Bowe, 12, who is autistic, was finally offered a place at a special school but has no transport to get there, forcing his mum to give up her job to drive him A 12-year-old autistic boy who spent six months out of school is struggling to find transport to take him to his new special school, forcing his mum to quit her job to drive him
Charlie Bowe was forced to quit his mainstream secondary school, a few weeks after enrolling as a Year 7 student, because staff couldn't meet his needs
Whilst he technically remained on roll for several months afterwards, his final lesson was in October, and he had no work allocated to him at home
His mother, Samantha Bowe, aged 32, told Stoke on Trent Live that it was affecting his mental health and he was really upset
After lodging a special needs tribunal, she was relieved to be offered a place at Abbey Hill School in Meir, where Charlie started last week
She commented: It’s the best place for him
But Samantha has been forced to relinquish her job in order to drive Charlie from their home in Trentham every day, to the school four miles away
Stoke-on-Trent City Council have refused to provide school transport
Instead, officials gave the family a personal budget of £15
38 a day to arrange taxis themselves
Samantha said: I started ringing round taxi services and they were all saying they couldn’t take him
Either they didn’t do school runs, they were fully booked or they said he was too young to take without a chaperone
Even if they could have taken him, I was getting quotes off some of them of £50 a day
Samantha found another Abbey Hill pupil, who lives in the Staffordshire County Council area, and qualifies for a minibus to travel to school and through Trentham
However, this transport is arranged via a separate local authority and there was no spare seat
Samantha has to drop off seven-year-old son Mason at Ash Green Primary Academy, in Trentham, before taking Charlie to school
But's he's now regularly arriving late for lessons at Abbey Hill, with his mum adding: It’s taking me an hour on the school run in the morning and an hour in the afternoon
Samantha’s boss at a cookware shop even contacted the council on her behalf
She said: The local authority just said my boss needed to be a bit flexible
It made us laugh as you can’t be flexible in retail
We are only a small staff
Although the job is still available if she can sort out the school transport, Samantha is currently out of work
Whilst appealing the council's transport decision, she has had to turn down the personal budget, so is funding fuel costs herself
It is just the latest in a series of battles to ensure Charlie gets the support he needs
As well as autism, he has learning difficulties and has the reading age of a six-year-old
We waited three years for his autism assessment
He finally got it this year, said Samantha
She says it also took three attempts to get an education, health and care plan

Harry Brinkworth, who is celebrating his 11th birthday today, was cheered up by complete strangers after he was told by classmates that they could go to his birthday because their parents didn't like him A boy with autism who was snubbed by his classmates for his party invites has had the 'best birthday ever'
Harry Brinkworth, who is 11 today, received hundreds of birthday cards from well-wishers after children in his class turned down his birthday invitations
The youngster was left sobbing after classmates said 'their parents did not like him' and would not go to his party

Harry Brinkworth, who is 11 today, received hundreds of birthday cards from well-wishers after children in his class turned down his birthday invitations
The youngster was left sobbing after classmates said 'their parents did not like him' and would not go to his party.
Oliver Harta's parents Nik and Sheryl, provided evidence of his learning difficulties and proof of a specialist bus he uses to go on his work experience run by the authority An autistic man has been stripped of his free travel pass in a move that his mum has slammed as 'absolute nonsense'
Oliver Harta has been told he no longer qualifies for a 'Freedom Pass' which allows him to travel across London for free
His family are desperately trying to fight for it to be reinstated after being told it would be revoked
The 20-year-old from Harrow, north west London, was told the news despite being given the pass which was valid until 2026
A letter from Harrow Council said Oliver's disability meant he was no longer qualified for it
Oliver's parents Nik and Sheryl, provided evidence of his learning difficulties and proof of a specialist bus he uses to go on his work experience, which is run by the authority
Sheryl said the council is insisting that she provides a letter from the NHS which explicitly outlines Oliver’s condition
She told MyLondon the council was making things more difficult for her family
Sheryl said: My son is almost 21 and he’s studying entry level maths and English
He doesn’t have any GCSEs, he attends a specialist college
It’s quite obvious that his autism impairs his social interaction
I really don’t understand it and it’s quite upsetting for us
How can the council just move the goalposts and say ‘having autism isn’t enough’ anymore? She explained how she told Oliver that he might have to use a bank card to travel on the bus, which he was confused about as it was a break from his regular routine
Sheryl said: It caused quite a stir and got him into a bit of a fluster as it’s something he’s not used to
He just kept asking ‘why?’ and saying ‘I’ve never had to do that before’
Sheryl has been in contact with the council, who put her in touch with a private company that manages the Freedom Pass applications in Harrow
She said the people making these decisions are not aware of the specific circumstances that affect each applicant and she thinks they are using a one size fits all checklist
She added: I’ve submitted loads of information, including his education and health care plan but they don’t want to know
They say we’ve got to have this specific piece of paper and getting hold of that could take up to a year - it’s wasting precious time.  It’s an absolute nonsense
Sheryl said the council is making things more difficult for her family in a situation where, if anything, they should be given more support
She said: It’s really obstructive
It’s not the easiest thing having a child with learning difficulties and then we have to go through things like this
Oliver can’t travel on his own so we have to pay to go with him
Now they’re asking us to pay on top of that
When you go to the cinema, they accept a carer card so somebody can go with him for free
I don’t know what’s different with Harrow Council
Harrow Council explained guidelines are set by the independent assessor, which determines who is eligible for a Freedom Pass based on types of disability
A council spokesperson said: We cannot comment on individual cases
Concessions are reviewed every three years to ensure the applicant continues to meet the criteria
As per the national guidelines, we can only go by what we are sent by the independent assessor
Applicants have a right to appeal this decision

Ellen Martin, 25, from Surrey, said her life changed in a split second when she was diagnosed with the suicide disease which is so painful people often turn to suicide A footballer has described her daily living hell in which she feels she like she is being burned alive after a doctor diagnosed her with a horrifying disease
Ellen Martin, 25, from Surrey has played for women's teams including Aston Villa and Fulham, but after sustaining a knee injury while playing in November last year, her world was turned upside down
Six weeks after her operation to repair the torn ligaments, the sports coach noticed her leg would go from burning hot to ice cold and went back to her surgeon for answers
But Ellen was horrified when doctors told her you've been diagnosed with the Suicide Disease
The disease, which affects the central nervous system, causes indescribable pain and is usually brought on through trauma or injury
Medically known as Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS), the condition is nicknamed the suicide disease due to the number of people who would rather die than live with the pain
Ellen said: Instantly I turned to google to find out what CRPS was. .
and the result was the worst possible outcome I could have read
I immediately broke down, crying and screaming in tears
I feel like my body is being burnt alive
Imagine feeling like your body is being set on fire while being electrocuted
I just want my life back
Before the injury, Ellen had played for multiple football teams and enjoyed a healthy active social life
But now she claims her life has been put on pause, with doctors warning that the degenerative disease will slowly rob her of her functions and mobility as the pain worsens
She said: The McGill Pain Index, a scale rating of pain developed by McGill University, rates CRPS as the top pain humans can experience ahead of childbirth and amputation without anaesthesia
It is a living hell
My life has spiralled downwards from a split-second tackle in a football match
I have been unable to walk freely, sit in a chair normally, socialise with friends and family or work
My whole life has paused
The daunting reality of life with CRPS is isolating, terrifying and debilitating
My doctor hadn't even heard of the condition and believed the pain was 'inside my head'
I am already dosed up on medications that cause 'brain fog' and severe side effect on top of my CRPS pain
But despite the terrifying diagnosis Ellen says there is a glimmer of hope
After countless hours of research, the young footballer has found a clinic in the US giving hope to CRPS patients
Ellen has launched a GoFundMe to raise £30,000 to get her to The Spero Clinic in Arkansas, US for a 12 week intensive course which will treat her pain using holistic remedies
She said: I have found a glimmer of hope that I can return to the wonderful life I lived before my injury and diagnosis
I understand, just like myself, many may believe this is 'too good to be true', and naturally, I had these reservations, but when you're faced with the horrific reality of life with CRPS. .
going to this clinic will be the best thing I ever do
I have since spoken with numerous patients who have attended the clinic who are now in remission and honestly now believe it is the place I need to be
So please, if you can, help me on my journey to remission from CRPS
I will be forever grateful
It's impossible to articulate or put into words what the last five months have been like, so the thought of deteriorating further is truly terrifying
Get email updates with the day's biggest stories Ellen Martin, 25, from Surrey, said her life changed in a split second when she was diagnosed with the suicide disease which is so painful people often turn to suicide A footballer has described her daily living hell in which she feels she like she is being burned alive after a doctor diagnosed her with a horrifying disease
Ellen Martin, 25, from Surrey has played for women's teams including Aston Villa and Fulham, but after sustaining a knee injury while playing in November last year, her world was turned upside down
Six weeks after her operation to repair the torn ligaments, the sports coach noticed her leg would go from burning hot to ice cold and went back to her surgeon for answers
But Ellen was horrified when doctors told her you've been diagnosed with the Suicide Disease
The disease, which affects the central nervous system, causes indescribable pain and is usually brought on through trauma or injury
Medically known as Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS), the condition is nicknamed the suicide disease due to the number of people who would rather die than live with the pain
Ellen said: Instantly I turned to google to find out what CRPS was. .
and the result was the worst possible outcome I could have read
I immediately broke down, crying and screaming in tears
I feel like my body is being burnt alive
Imagine feeling like your body is being set on fire while being electrocuted
I just want my life back

Suzanne Drinkwater woke up in summer last year to find her boyfriend dead in the bed beside her and she decided to take her own life- the couple's bodies would eventually be found there A woman tragically killed herself after waking up to find her boyfriend dead in their bed beside her
Suzanne Drinkwater woke up one morning in the summer last year and was horrified when she found her boyfriend 35-year-old Gavin Massey, was dead next to her
The heartbroken 32-year-old from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, took her own life that morning in the very same bed
When the couple were finally found after police bashed down their front door, one of the bodies was decomposing
She had been receiving help for a number of psychiatric conditions at the time of her death, the inquest into their deaths heard
Coroner Tom Osborne, sitting at Milton Keynes, heard how Gavin likely died from cardiomegaly, an enlarged heart, and left ventricular hypertrophy, worsened by the steroids he had been taking
His death was also exacerbated by a mixture of alcohol and drugs found in his system
The alarm was raised after Suzanne’s sister had been unable to contact her from August 4, and on August 7, she raised her fears with police
One day after that, they discovered the couple dead after police were forced to break into their home
There was no criticism of the agencies which had been helping both patients, during the joint inquest

Ian Chapman called the police after greeting a young man on a Lancashire bridge as he walked past with his dog and realising he was looking straight through him A passerby prevented a young man from taking his own life after spotting an eerie clue in his face
Ian Chapman, from Padiham, Lancashire, was walking over a bridge as he crossed paths with the stranger but after saying hello he realised there was something off
The 61-year-old noticed an absence of emotion in the man's eyes, as though he was looking straight through him
He realised he was going to take his own life and called the police, reports LancsLive
Ian said: I was walking past this gentleman who didn't reply to me
When I said hello and I turned around and he was climbing over the edge of the bridge
I offered him my phone, to see if there was anyone he wanted to ring
Then I thought, what am I doing? He could have just lost a family member and that could be really triggering for him
So, I turned away and called the police
Have you been affected by this story? Let us know at webnews@mirror. co
uk By the time Ian got to the end of the bridge, the police had already arrived
However, the dad-of-two didn't want to stay at the scene much longer and set off home
Ian said: I was just walking and my dog scared this lady who was tending to her garden
She saw me crying and asked if I was OK and if I wanted to come into her house
I just told her that I needed to get back home to my wife and I explained what had just happened
Her house was next door to a halfway house type place, so she came to tell me later on that the man had been saved
Although the gentleman was saved, Ian has no further update about him
The experience has stuck with him and a year on, Ian recognises that charities, particularly local ones, rely on funding which they often have to fight hard to get
Now, off the back of the incident he witnessed and his previous love of fundraising, Ian will be doing a walk, completely barefooted from Burnley to Bacup - a total of seven miles
Burnley born and bred, Ian decided he wanted to do the barefoot walk after brainstorming words that begin with the letter B, choosing the starting point, destination and how he'd go about it
His love for raising money came after the coronavirus pandemic which saw employees at his work laid of for one week every month
He said: Since April this year, one week a month we get laid off due to a shortage in the supply chain
So, I decided I needed another focus and I was thinking, what can I do? I was contemplating things beginning with a B for Burnley and it went from there, my wife thinks I'm off my head
Ian will be raising money for Casual Minds Matter CIC, a Burnley based charity that help to provide professional support and counselling to men who are struggling with their mental health
I've never really seen anyone who's had to battle with depression or alcohol or drug abuse or anything like that, Ian continued
It's just never really been something that the people around me have suffered with

I obviously knew people were living with it but I didn't fully appreciate to what degree people lived with it
When I do my walks, I carry my trainers with me and it's like a safety net if I decide I want to give up
People that are suffering don't always have those safety nets though and that's why I'm raising money for the charity
I just want to make people aware that if you need help, there's always someone just a phone call away
Ian has been gearing himself up for his walk, which will take place on Saturday, August 20 from St
Catherine's Community Centre to the Cornerstones pub in Bacup

Worried parents Rachel and husband Luke initially rushed Coco to hospital on 24 July 2017 but were sent home from the emergency department after being told she likely had Gastroenteritis A six-year-old autistic girl who died of sepsis after a 'catalogue' of errors was 'blamed' by medical staff for being uncooperative, an inquest heard
Coco Bradford lost her life after 'several opportunities' were missed by doctors and consultants to save her
This included failing to order basic blood and stool samples or offering her a simple course of intravenous fluids to rehydrate her, Cornwall Live reports
And her heartbroken mum Rachel Bradford told the coroner, staff then 'unforgivably' tried to cover up their own failings by blaming her daughter's autism and claiming she was being difficult to treat
Worried parents Rachel and husband Luke initially rushed Coco to hospital on 24 July 2017 but were sent home from the emergency department after being told she likely had Gastroenteritis
But she continued to pass liquid and bloody stools and could not hold down any fluids so was rushed back in less than a day later
The inquest heard upon admission, doctors still felt her condition was not serious despite the family pleading for more to be done
Her condition continued to deteriorate and she was transferred from the Treliske Royal Cornwall Hospital three days after admission to the Bristol Children's Hospital where she died of multiple organ failure caused by sepsis
Mrs Bradford, of St Ives, told the coroner on Monday she has fought for four years ever since to expose the truth and failings around her daughter's death at Treliske
Fighting back tears, she said they discovered medical staff had multiple opportunities to change the course of Coco's treatment that could have saved her life
This was from the first trip to the emergency department right up until her transfer to ITU
She added: None were acted upon
We do not accept human error should be a factor
This was failing of the most basic level of care
Every member of staff denied knowledge of bloody vomit and faeces yet it is in all notes
There were notes blaming Coco for being uncooperative
She was in a terrible amount of pain and dying in front of their eyes
The pathologist told the coroner Coco died on 31 July 2017 following withdrawal of intensive care and multi organ failure
She suffered Hemolytic uremic syndrome as a result of e coli 157
The inquest heard she had been transferred to Bristol Children's Hospital from Cornwall three days earlier
Rachel said the failures ranged from not ordering blood samples, giving her a pain score of 0, not picking up signs of sepsis and being not given an IV drip to rehydrate
She added: We have never been given the full details of the clinical picture and I'd like you to spare a thought how her sister Chelsea is feeling
A fellow clinician telling her not to worry and her little sister is fine
All concerns and questions around sepsis and e-coli dismissed - when actually she was dying
Had we not persisted and if Chelsea was not a healthcare professional, we would never know the truth of what happened to Coco
We are still waiting for the full truth l but I suspect that may never happen
Rachel added that she found all the failures, delays and lack of treatment staggering in this day of modern medicine
She said: Luke and I became more and more upset and concerned by the air of nonchalance of staff around her condition
It seemed they had no idea what was wrong with her
They did not recognise she was close to death
We were told she'd be fine and every time we asked we were told a stool sample was not needed or been requested
I felt they always thought I was overreacting and worrying for nothing every time we asked questions
Blaming Coco and her autism for their own incompetency and failure to treat her is absolutely unforgivable
Rachel said she had been told that e-coli 157 - if treated with aggressive fluid rehydration - had a survival rate of 97 per cent with babies and the elderly those who suffer worse
See what’s happening near you by entering your postcode below or visit InYourArea And she told the coroner the effect on her family of their loss had been indescribable
She added: To meet Coco was to love her
Her life with ours was getting better and better and she learned to communicate again
A week before she fell ill, I posted about how happy she was
She was in such a good place and we finally felt she would have the life she deserved and was going to mainstream school full time
If I could have sat in the bed with her and die as well, I would have done
Coco was my absolute world and living without her is almost too much to bear
Coco was a strong and healthy six-and-a-half-year-old
The effect on our family has been so deep and so divisive
Life will never be the same again
We are forced to live a life we did not want to.  We do not deserve
Not only have we lost beautiful Coco without the chance to live her life, we have been fractured to a level you will never understand

She said the family have spent four years battling and being lied to as she tried to get to the truth
We have been treated with the upmost contempt, she added
There have been tears, tears and more tears every single day
We just want the truth
You never know how it feels until it happens to you
Dr Saul Diaz Reales was the doctor who initially saw Coco in the emergency department at Treliske and sent her home
He told the coroner he had no evidence her blood pressure was not normal
He added: I would have wanted to see a blood sample if that was the case
In the benefit of hindsight it is difficult to have a case where Coco should not have been admitted
Looking at the evidence I had at the time I fail to see what I could have done better
He added he had 'no evidence' of there being blood in her stools and at the time was happy and satisfied to send her home

Organiser Lina Lukše posted: Our beloved friend, sister and mother, Diana Gabaliene, left us all with the greatest pain and incurable wounds
Our angel flew away, raising her wings high, too early and against her will
No one thought that our meeting, message or conversation was going to be the last
She wanted to live, to create and to share
She wanted to be loved
She didn't have enough time to make her dreams come true
She didn't have enough time to teach her children things that only a loving mother could teach

The tearful boy said he was frightened he might hurt himself or others around him and asked for help as his mum tried to comfort and reassure him A brave family has shared a harrowing video of their 10-year-old boy in torment in an attempt to find him the mental health support he desperately needs
The youngster, referred to as James to protect his identity, tearfully pleaded for help to stop him from hurting himself or others in a heartbreaking video filmed by his mum Michelle
James' family, of Staffordshire, said his mental health has been in decline since the death of a relative six years ago and he has now started to have dreams in which he hurts people
His devastated mum and aunt said he regularly talks about stabbing himself or jumping off a bridge but that he has never been seen in person or offered medication by Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS)
Instead, they are forced to rely on monthly Zoom meetings which they said have not restarted since their appointment was cancelled in November due to staff illness, reports Stoke on Trent Live
Michelle, 44, told how she put her son's bed in her room and wakes up every time he rolls over in case he tries to go downstairs in the night and hurt himself
I'm really frightened that I won't have my little boy for much longer and that one day he will kill himself, she said
He keeps saying he is worthless and just causes problems for the family
He says he wants brain surgery so he can have part of his brain removed and forget
He doesn't feel like he can ever recover from this
He has lost hope and doesn't want to be here anymore.  He's only 10
He shouldn't be having these thoughts
When the family called the All-Age Access Team in desperation, they said they were told to keep an eye on him or take him to A&E
They have even tried contacting their local council's social workers and safeguarding team for help
But Michelle said it feels like they are in a vicious circle where they keep getting sent back to CAMHS, run by North Staffordshire Combined Healthcare NHS Trust
She added: I tell him he's my baby and so special to me, and that he is worthy to be here, because he is
He is a lovely boy and so affectionate
I feel so sick and useless because he is pleading for help and I can't get him the help he's begging for
James is currently waiting for an autism assessment through Caudwell Children and is only able to attend his mainstream school in the mornings due to his mental health
He was initially offered bereavement support following the death of his grandmother but the sessions did not take place when the then four-year-old told counsellors he did not want to participate
He also received 12 counselling sessions through his school but his family said they were told he needed more support than the charity were equipped to provide
It was at this point when they did a self-referral to CAMHS and began meeting regularly with school staff to help his teachers cope with him
They told how James can be disruptive in class by shouting out, climbing out of his chair and throwing things across the room
He also exhibits tics such as rolling his head and shoulders, repetitive coughing, clearing his throat and excessive blinking and tends to walk on his tiptoes
The little boy also talks obsessively about death and describes gruesome scenes in detail
Aunt Amy, 47, said: He loves destruction and disasters
He will talk about people falling out of planes, hitting the concrete and then getting run over by cars
He struggles with empathy and it doesn't bother him if people get upset by hearing it - he just carries on
We don't know where it has come from because he has never watched that kind of thing on television
James' mental health deteriorated further during Covid lockdowns and homeschooling left him inconsolable
Michelle said she has tried every parenting course she can find in an attempt to help her son who is academically bright but struggles socially
James, whose older sister has autism, was assessed for the disorder and ADHD by CAMHS four years ago but the family were told he did not meet the criteria and he was discharged
Since this summer, they have been having monthly Zoom meetings with CAMHS but feel their pleas for more urgent support are being ignored
Amy said: I just hope that by raising awareness we can help him in some way, which is why we filmed the video
We want to do everything possible to safeguard him and make sure his end goal doesn't happen
North Staffordshire Combined Healthcare NHS Trust said they were unable to comment on individual cases

A dad in Orlando, in the US, is believed to have killed his wife and three daughters in a suspected murder-suicide
Donovan Michael Ramirez and his family were found dead at their home A dad is accused of brutally executing his family before turning the gun on himself in a murder-suicide
Donovan Michael Ramirez, 45, allegedly murdered his three daughters and wife in a disturbing murder-suicide in Orlando, Florida, in the US
Victims of the attack were daughters Alyssa Berumen, 22, Sunny Ramirez, 11, and Shelby Rose Ramirez, 7, and they were killed alongside their mum, 39-year-old Renee Ramirez
The family was found dead on Tuesday after they were called to conduct a welfare check on Tuesday, August 4
Police have not yet confirmed the cause of death of the victims and one of the officers is said to have stepped outside the house after he became sick when he saw the grisly scene on Lake District Lane in Lake Nona
They have, however, admitted the incident was likely a domestic abuse case
Local law enforcement said: At this time, it appears this is a domestic violence-related incident
Investigators worked overnight to gather as much information as possible
As this is still an active and ongoing investigation, no further updates will be provided at this time
It was confirmed a gun was recovered from the scene, but police are still waiting on reports from medical examiners to release more information
The family were killed at the home they had moved into in 2020 and locals have expressed their complete shock over what took place
Nearby residents said they suspected nothing out of the ordinary or anything strange was going on before the killings occurred
Sunny's friends Katelyn Rampersad and Amarie Padovani attended Northlake Park Community School
Both 11, they said she made them feel at home in Florida
Neighbour Heather Collins told WESH: I think it's like a worst nightmare truly
I don't even know what happened exactly
My heart goes out to the family
I can't even begin to wrap my mind around any of this, especially if there were family involved
Justin Rossilini said: They seemed like they were a normal family
I seen the dad, seen the mom, and two little girls
I didn't hear anything, I wish I did
I definitely would have liked to have been that concerned neighbour that did something in this situation
According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 45,222 people died from gun-related injuries in the US in 20202 alone
Around 46 per cent of the deaths were not suicide-related

Indre Razutyte, from Pontefract, West Yorkshire, who was loved by everyone she met, was found dead in her garage on March 22, Wakefield Coroner's Court was told A mother who was loved by everyone she met took her own life at home, an inquest heard
Indre Razutyte, 31, was found unresponsive in her kitchen by her ex-partner on March 22
CPR was performed at the home in Pontefract, West Yorkshire, but Indre was declared dead
Suicide notes were found in the kitchen, Yorkshire Live reports
Indre leaves behind a two-year-old daughter
Wakefield Coroner's Court heard on Friday that Indre was much loved by her colleagues at small transport firm Centika Logistics
The mother was a transport manager there, and made such an impression on me immediately
Colleague Wayne Kearns, who joined the company in September last year, said: We're a small company, more like a family
Because of that I worked closely with Indre and we became good friends
She was like a little sister to me
She did used to sometimes talk about the issues she was facing, but it was such a shock to hear about her death and so heartbreaking
We'd spoken the day before when she was working from home
That day me and the manager had been messaging her because she hadn't come in
Losing Indre has felt like losing a member of the family
She was one of the nicest and kindest people I have ever met, she would help anybody
She was so nice, and I don't think she realised how lovely a person she was and how loved she was
I think she was worried about being left on her own
Indre's heartbroken family live in Lithuania, and are hoping to repatriate her home for a funeral there
Wayne and some of Indre's other colleagues have set up a GoFundMe page to help them pay for the costs of getting Indre home
As of April 8, the page is at £4,795
Any money left over from the fundraising will be put into a trust fund for Indre's two-year-old daughter
When we had drivers at the company who were having a bad day and would snap at anyone else, Indre was the only one who could calm them down
Customers would ask for her specifically
She could relate to anybody and I don't think she realised how great she was, Wayne added
She was really good at her job and just at talking to people
We always had a laugh in the office together
If she was feeling down I'd go to Morrisons and get us cake
Indre made such a big impact on me straight away
I wish I could've had the time to get to know her even better
The full inquest has been adjourned to a later date
Assistant coroner John Hobson did recount in brief the events that preceded Indre's death being recorded

Benjamin Davis, from Greater Manchester, was given the reference in the context that his autism diagnosis was. .
part of him but not all of him, a court heard A 22-year-old took his own life after being given a gravestone reference during a therapy session, a court heard
Benjamin Davis, also known as Binyomin Chaim Davis, took his own life only a few months after the session, having never got over that experience, his dad said
The young man was found at his home in Prestwich, Greater Manchester, and died at Salford Royal Hospital in November five days later
An inquest was held at Bolton Coroner's Court on Wednesday where private counsellor Avremi Rosenberg admitted that he should have used different wording in his session with Benjamin, who was 21 at the time
He also accepted that the language was inappropriate, reports Manchester Evening News
Mr Davis, Benjamin's dad, told the court that his son had a charming smile and was a special person
Speaking at the inquest, he said: We really miss him
He had a kind nature with a charming smile
He was a great student, he enjoyed photography, walking, and spending time with his family
He was a real pleasure to be with and he’s missed by family and friends
Despite his academic prowess, Benjamin struggled initially to fit in at school but eventually made a close knit group of friends
His challenges at school meant Benjamin was diagnosed with depression and anxiety in 2018, Mr Davis continued
The youngster was also diagnosed with autism in 2021, assistant coroner Rachel Syed heard
After this diagnosis, Benjamin had five counselling sessions with Mr Rosenberg in spring last year
And it was during these sessions in which Mr Rosenberg referenced a gravestone, Mr Davis said
He added: I asked Mr Rosenberg about it and he confirmed he did [say it]
When asked why used the imagery, Mr Rosenberg said he said 'in the context that his autism diagnosis was… part of him but not all of him'
He added: Benjamin approached me because he knew I was a counsellor with experience with working with people on the autism spectrum
In hindsight, this would have been better dealt with by the NHS
I did apologise to Benjamin for the way it came over
It was definitely not said in a blunt way
It was very much in the context that his autism diagnosis was very important and it was part of him but not all of him, and in that context what would be written on his gravestone
In the future whatever I can do to help you to come to terms about what has happened, I would properly arrange it
I express my sincerest, sincerest condolences
When asked by the coroner if his choice of words was inappropriate, Mr Rosenberg replied: Definitely, yes
Ms Syed said at the conclusion of the hearing that she would be writing a letter of concern to Mr Rosenberg’s organisation
She also will be writing letters of concern to Benjamin’s GP surgery Whittaker Lane Medical Centre and Greater Manchester Mental Health Trust (GMMH)
The coroner explained: A formal letter of concern will be written to the GP, GMMH, and the private organisation, highlighting the need to ensure a more collaborative working approach between these organisations and sharing information such as diagnoses of autism
I will also reference the need to have more training on autism as a condition
Earlier in the hearing, Benjamin’s GP in the final months of his life, Dr Rebecca-Ann Sheppard-Hickey, said she could not find a record of a formal autism diagnosis in his notes
Dr Ruth Watson, from GMMH, carried out an internal review of Benjamin’s care, and also admitted mistakes were made with clinical staff now receiving more in-depth training on autism
She said: The main focus is that staff need additional training on autism
It is going to be added to our clinical risk training as an additional focus point
Dr Watson did however add it was difficult to say if Benjamin’s death was preventable from the perspective of mental health services, as his last involvement with the service came around two months before his passing
Recording a verdict of suicide, Ms Syed confirmed that Benjamin’s medical cause of death was hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy
She concluded: I am sadly satisfied to the relevant legal threshold [Benjamin] intended to take his own life
I am therefore in law required to record a verdict of suicide
I hope you can focus on the wonderful memories you have of Benjamin

Matthew Langley was so malnourished his bones were visible through his skin after being left locked up and neglected by Craig and Lorna Hewitt for seven months
The shocking conditions an autistic man who was found 'close to death' after being held captive by his mum and stepdad have been revealed as the couple face jail
Matthew Langley was so malnourished his bones were visible through his skin after being left locked up and neglected by Craig and Lorna Hewitt for seven months
The pair were last week found guilty of false imprisonment after Sheffield Crown Court heard 22-year-old Matthew was found weighing just 6st (38kg)in a faeces and vomit-strewn bedroom
South Yorkshire Police have now released a grim photograph showing piles of rubbish and soiled items
It lays bare the shocking squalor that Matthew had been held in by the Hewitts, who kept the door locked
The court heard police found faeces and vomit over the floor and bedding along with buzzing flies, a bad smell and a key on the outside of the door
The National Autistic Society said the scene was deeply disturbing
Matthew, who also had learning difficulties, suffered from irritable bowel syndrome, double incontinence and arthritis, the court heard
Jurors heard Matthew was found by paramedics seriously underweight, dehydrated and 'with his life hanging in the balance' on June 2, 2020
Nicholas Campbell QC, prosecuting, told the trial the ambulance service was called to the home in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, in the early hours of June 2, 2020
Matthew was rushed to a hospital intensive care unit in a pitiable state with abrasions indicating he had been moving around on all fours, the prosecutor told the court
He had suffered damage to a kidney with high sodium levels relating to severe dehydration, it was heard
Mr Campbell added: His sodium levels were dangerously high.  They measured 180
They were so high they could shut down his brain and kill him
Anything above 145, there is a real chance of death
The Home Office pathologist examined the injuries and said the abrasions and bruises were consistent in his view with Matthew having been crawling on all fours over objects in his path
Mr Campbell said Matthew made a good physical recovery thanks to the hard work of medical professionals and when he was discharged from hospital he weighed 55kg
Craig Hewitt told police his wife Lorna had found Matthew upstairs lying on the floor and he claimed Matthew had been fed and that he ate in his room, the court heard
He also claimed there had been locks on the internal doors because their home used to be a student accommodation
Mr Hewitt stated to police that his stepson Matthew had only been locked in at night because he would go downstairs and set off security alarms
Lorna Hewitt chose to give no comment answers to all questions asked by the police, the court heard
The Hewitts, of Sheffield, South Yorks, were also found guilty of causing or allowing a vulnerable adult to suffer serious physical harm
The couple are due to be sentenced on Friday, February 18

The pair were last week found guilty of false imprisonment after Sheffield Crown Court heard 22-year-old Matthew was found weighing just 6st (38kg)in a faeces and vomit-strewn bedroom
South Yorkshire Police have now released a grim photograph showing piles of rubbish and soiled items
It lays bare the shocking squalor that Matthew had been held in by the Hewitts, who kept the door locked
The court heard police found faeces and vomit over the floor and bedding along with buzzing flies, a bad smell and a key on the outside of the door
The National Autistic Society said the scene was deeply disturbing
Matthew, who also had learning difficulties, suffered from irritable bowel syndrome, double incontinence and arthritis, the court heard
Jurors heard Matthew was found by paramedics seriously underweight, dehydrated and 'with his life hanging in the balance' on June 2, 2020
Nicholas Campbell QC, prosecuting, told the trial the ambulance service was called to the home in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, in the early hours of June 2, 2020
Matthew was rushed to a hospital intensive care unit in a pitiable state with abrasions indicating he had been moving around on all fours, the prosecutor told the court
He had suffered damage to a kidney with high sodium levels relating to severe dehydration, it was heard
Mr Campbell added: His sodium levels were dangerously high.  They measured 180
They were so high they could shut down his brain and kill him
Anything above 145, there is a real chance of death
The Home Office pathologist examined the injuries and said the abrasions and bruises were consistent in his view with Matthew having been crawling on all fours over objects in his path
Mr Campbell said Matthew made a good physical recovery thanks to the hard work of medical professionals and when he was discharged from hospital he weighed 55kg
Craig Hewitt told police his wife Lorna had found Matthew upstairs lying on the floor and he claimed Matthew had been fed and that he ate in his room, the court heard
He also claimed there had been locks on the internal doors because their home used to be a student accommodation
Mr Hewitt stated to police that his stepson Matthew had only been locked in at night because he would go downstairs and set off security alarms
Lorna Hewitt chose to give no comment answers to all questions asked by the police, the court heard
The Hewitts, of Sheffield, South Yorks, were also found guilty of causing or allowing a vulnerable adult to suffer serious physical harm
The couple are due to be sentenced on Friday, February 18

Robert Needham, 42, killed his wife Kelly Fitzgibbons, 40, and his two daughters, Ava, four, Lexi, two, and their dog at their £600,000 home before taking his own life in March 2020 A distraught uncle has described his moment of terror when he found his niece and her daughters slaughtered by her husband
Robert Needham, 42, killed his wife Kelly Fitzgibbons, 40, and his two daughters, Ava, four, Lexi, two, and their dog at their £600,000 home before taking his own life
The tragedy happened in the quiet village of Woodmancote in West Sussex just a week into lockdown in March 2020
Kelly’s uncle, Ronald Peacock, told an inquest in Horsham, West Sussex, on Tuesday about the moment he found their bodies after climbing through an open window into the couple's bedroom
Mr Peacock added: I realised I could see Ava’s head on the bed, under the duvet
Both girls laying side by side in the bed
I could see Kelly on the floor, near the door
Rob was on the floor in the hallway
I climbed through the window
The TV was on and I could see blood on the pillows
I could tell they were both dead.  Kelly was dead
It was obvious from the position and the amount of blood there was nothing I could do for her
He also said he found Needham lying in the hallway with the shotgun pointed at his head.  He then called 999
The Sun reports he said: I could feel the cold on the back of my head
Kelly was cold, Ava was cold and Lexi too was cold
The inquest was also told Needham was a secret cocaine user and, in the days leading up to the tragedy, had tried to get hold of the drug from a supplier without success
The inquest heard toxicology tests also showed he had not taken any cocaine at the time of the tragedy, but a hair sample test showed he had been a cocaine user
It was also said that in the past he had been forced to see a doctor over the damage the drug had caused to his nose
It was also said Needham had been suffering financial problems in the run-up to the Covid lockdown in March 2020
The family had earlier moved into his family home to help care for his mother, Maureen, 77, after his father Rex, who suffered from Parkinson's disease, died in 2017
They lived upstairs rent-free while his mother lived in a granny flat downstairs
He was building an extension to the house but the family had run into financial problems and had stopped contributing to the bills
The builder had also been forced to take out a loan of £20,000 from his mother to cover his family's day-to-day living
When Covid struck, Needham found it difficult getting hold of building supplies and had to put the work extension on hold, it was said
In a statement to the hearing, Kelly's twin sister, Emma Ambler, said she did not believe the couple had any serious money worries
The inquest heard how Needham had a history of mental illness and an official caution for theft but omitted it when applying for a firearms licence in 2016
He was issued with a firearms licence despite admitting the lies to a police officer, a coroner was told
He then used the certificate to buy a semi-automatic shotgun shortly before killing his family
Needham declared on the application he had never had a criminal conviction and had no history of mental health problems
However, he had previously suffered at least two bouts of mental health problems in 2003 and 2013 and had been treated for depression, it was said
He had also previously been issued with a caution from police for stealing a bicycle going back many years
At the time of his application, a firearms enquiry officer from Hampshire Police questioned Needham at this home, the inquest heard
When Needham was told his GP would be contacted in relation to the application he then told the cop about his mental health problems and admitted having a criminal conviction
The hearing was told he told the officer he did not think they were relevant because they were a long time ago
Chief Inspector Nigel Lecointe of Hampshire said he would have expected greater scrutiny of the application
He said the omissions should have been a cause for concern and raised a red flag
Guidance for firearms licensing in 2016 stated: Whether the applicant is found to have made a false statement is of particular relevance
Deliberate failure to declare relevant convictions, medical conditions or medical history tends to show unfitness regardless of whether the certificate would have been refused if the appropriate declaration had been made
The firearms licence was approved by Sussex Police after Needham and the family moved to the county
The hearing was told Hampshire Police was minded to grant the firearms certificate but Mr Needham moved home and the decision to grant final approval was transferred to the Sussex force
Firearms licences are valid for five years
Mr Lecointe told the court: We should never be complacent about what we do
Our job is to try and do the right thing but we will make judgements with the best intentions
We won’t always get it right but we will try.  The inquest continues

Chloe Barber, of Driffield, East Yorkshire, was bullied at school, self-harmed and eventually took her own life at home in November last year
Her mum has shared her grief A devastated mother has shared her grief after her teenage daughter was found hanged at the family home
Kirsten Barber said Chloe Barber, 18, fell through the cracks of the mental health system after several stays in psychiatric hospitals
Her brother Reece Barber, 15, discovered Chloe unresponsive and, though her called 999 and gave Chloe CPR, the teenager was pronounced dead at the home in Driffield, East Yorkshire
Speaking today, grief-stricken Kirsten said Chloe struggled after being diagnosed with unstable personality disorder
She told Hull Live : You know when people say they’re heartbroken? This is heartbroken
When you split up with your boyfriend and stuff like that you think you know heartbreak.  But this is heartbreak
Anyone who is able to can donate to Kirsten's JustGiving page for their Three Peaks challenge for Chloe here
There are times when I just want to tell Chloe something, like when our dogs have done something daft and then you remember you can’t
But I know she’s still here
I had Covid last month and the worst thing about it was losing my sense of smell
I went into her bedroom because I just go in there every so often to be near her, and I couldn’t smell her
The family had first noticed signs Chloe was struggling in 2017 when she was a victim of bullying at school
She also self-harmed as her condition deteriorated over the following years
On one occasion, Chloe didn't return to Mill Lodge Hospital in York after going for a walk
And in early 2021, the teenager was hospitalised at Cygnet Health Care where her problems with self harm became worse
It was at Cygnet where she also met friend Chelsea Blue Mooney, a teenager from Bridlington, North Yorkshire, who shortly later died while in the unit's care
Chloe was left devastated by 17-year-old Chelsea’s death in April last year
Kirsten continued: Mental health is an invisible killer
If someone’s got cancer or a broken leg you can physically see it and you can physically mend it
We still don’t know exactly what Chloe was going through
She was a very secretive person
Chloe took her own life in November last year
Kirsten is taking on the Yorkshire Three Peaks later this spring to raise cash for young suicide charity Papyrus
Figures released by the Office of National Statistics (ONS) this week show 587 people in Yorkshire & the Humber took their lives in 2021 - of which 419 were men or boys and 168 women or girls
Data suggests suicide figures did not rise during the pandemic, although have slowly risen over the past 10 years
And while suicide remains the biggest killer of young men, the number of female suicides has been insidiously creeping up in recent years
Papyrus supports young people affected by suicide and suicidal thoughts, and has seen a 25% increase in calls, texts and emails to its confidential HOPELINEUK service
In 2020 and 2021 at least one in every three contacts was from a child under the age of 18
Anyone who is able to can donate to Kirsten's JustGiving page for their Three Peaks challenge for Chloe here
A spokesperson from Humber Teaching NHS Foundation Trust, said: It is the position of the Trust that we do not comment on individual cases, as we prefer to discuss directly with the families who are affected
The Samaritans is available 24/7 if you need to talk

Nicola Cassidy is launching a legal battle in a desperate bid to free her son from his life in a box where she says his care is worse than being in prison, his meals are pushed through a hatch and he is constantly watched via CCTV A young man with autism has been locked up in an old file room with his meals pushed through a hatch for more than four years according to his desperate mum
Patient A, 24, lives at private psychiatric facility, Cheadle Royal Hospital in Greater Manchester, which is part of the Priory group
His mother, Nicola Cassidy, 49, says his movements inside the tiny room, are constantly tracked by CCTV, he has no physical contact with anybody and his meals are slid through a gap in the bottom of a wooden hatch
Patient A, who also has a learning disability and Tourette's syndrome, has been detained under the Mental Health Act since September 2017 in what his mum claims is an old file room at the back of the hospital
Now Nicola from Liverpool is preparing to launch a legal battle to have him released from his life in a box adding that people wouldn't treat an animal like they do her son and his care is worse than being in prison
She said: We fully appreciate that my son has complex needs but he's being treated terribly
He's locked away from the world and has no physical contact with anyone
For his meals to be pushed through a tiny gap in the bottom of the hatch is awful
People wouldn't treat an animal that way and I feel that his care is worse than being in prison
He has challenges but is a loving and caring person who needs stimulation and support
He is getting nothing at present
I can't even hold his hand or hug him because of the conditions he's kept in
The desperate mum is taking her case to the Court of Protection in the hopes a judge will review her son's sectioning under the Mental Health Act - and with the help of Liverpool's Clinical Commissioning Group and Council get him back into a home in the community
Currently, Patient A has a bedroom, a bathroom and a small lounge area, plus a snug or sensory room, where he often sleeps, under the eye of a CCTV camera at Cheadle Royal Hospital

Nicola says he is looked after by staff at a ratio of five to one and when his room needs cleaning he is shut in a separate area, such as an area of garden, closed off by high metal fencing
She believes with the right support her son will flourish and be able to spend more time with his family
She said: Every time I see him it breaks my heart
He has no quality of life, he just exists
I've been told by some of those involved in my son's care that things aren't working and Patient A could, with the right support, be cared for in the community
It's difficult not to think that the longer he's left, the worse his condition will become, until the point where he's unable to be released.  This isn't about money
He has five carers assigned to him all the time
That level of staffing is costly and is probably a waste of money given that he has no contact with anyone
We keep asking for more to be done to support my son but nothing seems to happen
We've been left with no choice other than to take this action
All I want is what any mum would want and that is the best for their son so he can try and make the most of his life
Nicola says her son had a typical childhood up until around the age of 12
He was diagnosed as autistic aged seven, then later with Tourette's and a learning disability
It was around the age of 14 that his family started to struggle with managing the changes in his mental state and Patient A hit crisis point
He left his family home to go into residential care aged 14 in 2012 and was moved from placement to placement
He was admitted to Mersey Lodge ward in Cheadle Royal Hospital on September 5, 2017, where he has stayed ever since
Kirsty Stuart, an expert public law and human rights lawyer at Irwin Mitchell representing Patient A and Nicola, said: This is yet another case where the loved ones of people with autism and/or a learning disability are detained in units which were not designed to care for people such as Patient A
The first-hand account we've heard from Nicola about what's happening to her son is probably the worst I've heard
Understandably Patient A's family are deeply concerned
We're now investigating these concerns and how the legal process can help the family
We call on The Priory, the CCG and local authority to work with ourselves and Patient A's family to reach an agreement over his care, which the family believe should be in the community as this would give him the best quality of life
A total of 2,040 people with learning disabilities and/or autism were in the hospitals at the end of August 2021, according to NHS Digital figures
Of those, 1,145 - 56 percent - had been in hospital for a total of more than two years
The average cost to the taxpayer of keeping a person detained in hospital is thought to be £3,563 per week or £185,276 per year
But the Priory Group, which runs the private psychiatric hospital, has denied Nicola's claims that food is slid under the hatch to her son
The group claim the facility is purpose-built and while it does have a serving hatch in the door, they say it is a large square space where items of various sizes can be passed though including his food on a tray
A spokesman for the group also said the accommodation was fully renovated to provide the care package that has been commissioned by the Clinical Commissioning Group
The group added the family provided input at the time on the design and were supportive of the accommodation being provided
A Priory spokesman said: The welfare of the people we look after is our number one priority
We are fully committed to the Transforming Care agenda and to ensuring well-planned transfers to the most appropriate community settings whenever they become available
Our Adult Care division has successfully provided at least 39 such placements, with positive outcomes for the individuals involved
Unfortunately, however, some individuals with highly complex behaviours, and detained under the Mental Health Act, can be difficult to place despite all parties working very hard together over a long period of time to find the right setting
At all times we work closely with families, commissioners, and NHSE to ensure patients are receiving the safest, most appropriate care in our facilities
That care is delivered and kept under regular review by a multi-disciplinary team of experts, including a consultant psychiatrist and an NHS autism specialist, and independently reviewed by commissioners
Staff provide round-the-clock support at Mersey Lodge and all interventions are carefully and continually reviewed, monitored and assessed to ensure they are in the best interests of patients, with the aim of achieving the least restrictive setting possible
Medication is always prescribed by a consultant psychiatrist, and where patients are detained under the MHA, agreed by a second, independent doctor from the CQC
We aim to reduce medications to the lowest possible doses to keep people safe
Specialist placements - whether residential or in the community - require significant funding and are commissioned by the NHS or Clinical Commissioning Groups who have statutory obligations to achieve the best value and the highest possible quality
Priory provides these placements as they are commissioned with considerable input from families and funders in order to make sure the environment and care provided are appropriate
Priory is always ready and willing to participate in any review of a placement as part of the Transforming Care programme

Unfortunately, however, some individuals with highly complex behaviours, and detained under the Mental Health Act, can be difficult to place despite all parties working very hard together over a long period of time to find the right setting
At all times we work closely with families, commissioners, and NHSE to ensure patients are receiving the safest, most appropriate care in our facilities
That care is delivered and kept under regular review by a multi-disciplinary team of experts, including a consultant psychiatrist and an NHS autism specialist, and independently reviewed by commissioners
Staff provide round-the-clock support at Mersey Lodge and all interventions are carefully and continually reviewed, monitored and assessed to ensure they are in the best interests of patients, with the aim of achieving the least restrictive setting possible
Medication is always prescribed by a consultant psychiatrist, and where patients are detained under the MHA, agreed by a second, independent doctor from the CQC
We aim to reduce medications to the lowest possible doses to keep people safe
Specialist placements - whether residential or in the community - require significant funding and are commissioned by the NHS or Clinical Commissioning Groups who have statutory obligations to achieve the best value and the highest possible quality
Priory provides these placements as they are commissioned with considerable input from families and funders in order to make sure the environment and care provided are appropriate
Priory is always ready and willing to participate in any review of a placement as part of the Transforming Care programme

Gaia Pope-Sutherland's was worried about the imminent release from prison of a man she had accused of raping her and her mental health was suffering, an inquest heard A missing teenager had feared she was pregnant days before her death, an inquest heard today
Gaia Pope-Sutherland, 19, was reported missing from her home in Swanage, Dorset on November 7, 2017
Her body was found 11 days later in the undergrowth
Dorset Coroner's Court heard that Gaia's mental health was suffering due to worries about the imminent release from prison of a man she had accused of raping her
She had also recently split up with her boyfriend and had been sent indecent images on social media, the inquest heard
Gaia, who suffered from severe epilepsy and post-traumatic stress disorder, had been experiencing ongoing manic episodes in the weeks before her disappearance, it was said
Forensic pathologist Dr Russell Delaney told the hearing her naked body was found in deep undergrowth and that she had died from hypothermia
Gaia's clothing was found scattered across a field as if she had been removing it as she walked
Dr Delaney said told the hearing at the time of her disappearance she had recently split from her boyfriend and had become convinced she was pregnant, even though a test was negative
He said there was no medical evidence she was pregnant at the time of her death
Gaia had been due to see the GP for an appointment at 5pm the day she vanished
Dr Delaney said the day she disappeared the teen left her aunt's home at about 3
40pm and went to a friend's where she was behaving irrationally and began undressing
Gaia redressed but left without her coat, and the last known sighting of her was a few minutes later
Dr Delaney said the post-mortem examination found no signs of trauma, but there was evidence of Wischnewski spots in the lining of her stomach - a sign of hypothermia
The pathologist said there were several possibilities why Gaia had undressed before her death
It is possible Gaia was suffering from paradoxical undressing - where she thought she was overheating and removed her clothing
Another possibility could have been her declining mental health
He said: It is possible she was undressed because of her deteriorating mental health and that has made her vulnerable to hypothermia
The deterioration of her mental health has led to her being outside, and cold and wet, and led to her becoming more confused with hypothermia
The undressing is typical of paradoxical undressing and hypothermia
She also had minor cuts to her feet and shins, consistent with walking through gorse and brambles while not wearing shoes or socks
Dr Delaney described a condition called hide and die where someone suffering from hypothermia burrows into a closed space
Gaia, who used cannabis and ecstasy, was prescribed medication to treat up to five seizures a day, but Dr Delaney could not be sure she had suffered one before her death
He said: I am certain that hypothermia has made a significant contribution to her death
It is significant to explain her death alone
It could have acted in concert with epilepsy
In the absence of anyone witnessing the seizure, there isn't a way of determining to a significant degree of certainty that someone has had a seizure immediately prior to death
Dr Delaney said he believed Gaia had died a number of days before her body was found but was unable to say exactly when
He said: I would always urge caution by trying to be too specific and narrow the time frame down too much
Research entomologist Martin Hall has previously told the inquest that having examined blowfly larvae recovered from the teenager's body he believed the latest she was alive was November 9

Jade Wilcott's family, from Plymouth, are campaigning for more awareness around mental health and say the mum was failed after losing her best friend and asking for help A heartbroken mum decided to end her own life after the sudden death of her best friend
Jade Wilcott's family told how defeated she must have felt to leave behind her daughter and most previous possession in life
She died overnight after a heart-to-heart with her granddad during which she had appeared to calm down, reports Plymouth Live
The 24-year-old struggled with her mental health which took a turn for the worst during lockdown after her friend and grandparents had to shield, and she felt extremely isolated
Despite her pleas for help, the young mum was failed, according to relatives who believe her death sends a clear message about the urgent need for mental health treatment
Jade was described as an intelligent, lovable and hardworking woman by family during her inquest at Plymouth Coroner's Court on Monday
Relatives said in a statement: Jade Elizabeth Wilcott was a beautiful, caring and thoughtful woman and mother
She was deeply loved by everyone who knew her
She struggled tremendously with her mental health from a young age and despite many times asking for help, she was failed
To take her own life, all must understand how defeated she must have felt leaving behind her most precious possession in life, her daughter Neveah
She will forever be missed
Jade's father told how his daughter had begged for help, which she should have received that same day
She messaged me that night and was saying that she needed help, he recalled
We ended up paying for private counselling because of the wait

Our message is that mental health treatment needs to be there for people, her dad added

She was prescribed medication to tackle her depression and help her sleep
A report from Livewell Southwest noted it received a referral to their Liaison Psychiatry team on May 14, weeks before Jade's death
One mental health nurse noted that Jade had admitted to taking a quantity of pills after recently suffering a bereavement
But a risk assessment considered her to be a low risk of self harm and that she did not wish to end her life
The mum had told medical staff that she had acted on impulse
Her grandfather Robert Wilcott said in a statement how Jade and her sister regularly visited and stayed at his home

Toxicologists confirmed Jade had taken a combination of alcohol and a 'non-toxic' level of cocaine while a post mortem gave the cause of death as ligature compression of the neck
Robert told in his statement how her death was a terrible loss to her family and described her as a fantastic girl and an amazing mother to her daughter
Civilian investigator Phil Trevains told the inquest it was clear Jade had been upset following the death of her mother a few years previously, compounded with the death of a close friend just a few weeks before her suicide
He said medical reports showed she had struggled with her mental health and noted that counselling suggestions offered to Jade had come a little too late
The expert further highlighted the difficulties of accessing counselling during the coronavirus lockdown
Mr Arrow concluded that Jade had sadly taken her own life and expressed his profound condolences to her family of which many attended the inquest
He said: She was clearly a young lady who had a lot to offer friends, family and society

Damilya Jussipaliyeva's boyfriend sent the revenge porn to a friend and threatened to show it to her family - coroner's court heard she was in a 'disturbed state' before taking her own life A business student whose boyfriend shared a revenge porn film of her with a friend took her own life in a disturbed state, a coroner has found
Damilya Jussipaliyeva, 21, plunged 80ft to her death a week after Alessio Bianchi sent the video of her performing a sex act on him in a phone booth to a friend
Alessio, 30, was so angered by her spreading rumours about him he had threatened to show her family the clip and said he would also send them footage of her taking cocaine
Damilya left a suicide note which read: Alessio I love you, sorry
Another said: Mommy and Daddy I'm sorry
Hours before her death, Damilya and Alessio had fought outside his flat and he pushed her into a fountain, Inner West London Coroner's Court heard
Recording a narrative verdict, assistant coroner Bernard Richmond said: This is a tragic case
Her mind was plainly disturbed and in that state she formed an intention to kill herself
Electronic devices showed she had been searching for methods of suicides, terraces and heights, the inquest heard
There had been a rapid deterioration in her mental health in the last few days, the coroner said
She was in a very disturbed state immediately prior to her death
The coroner confirmed Damilya's injuries were consistent with a fall from a great height
He said there were no injuries, indicative of assault or restraint by a third party
The coroner said Damilya had suffered stress, depression and anxiety due to a number if factors, including her relationship with her family, her own drug and alcohol use, difficulties in coping with her degree course and her relationship with her boyfriend
The coroner described how Damilya had tried to take her own life twice before and was stopped from doing so
She said that by June 1, 2017 the student's mental state had significantly deteriorated
Shortly before she died at 1
20am, Damilya's mind was plainly disturbed and in that state she formed that intention to kill herself evidenced by goodbye notes to her parents and partner
Alessio, who was born in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia and Damilya, who was from Kazakhstan, had been in an on-off relationship for two-and-a-half years
They met at Regent's University in 2017 where they were both studying business
Alessio said: She was a sweet girl.  We had similar personalities.  We had similar backgrounds
The couple's friends were aware of their tumultuous relationship and Alessio had reported her to police himself on several occasions, when she had scratched him and she had attempted suicide
He told the inquest he had prevented a suicide attempt by Ms in September 2016
The court heard they were both using drugs, including cocaine, cannabis and ketamine, as well as alcohol
She was sent a video recording on WhatsApp of her in the phone booth in north London, on May 25, 2017
Attached was a message saying: I am going to keep destroying you
One of her friends received the same clip from three different numbers, with one containing the threat: I will f**k you up next, my love
Alessio claimed she had been spreading rumours about him and he sent the sex video to make her stop

The woman claims two hooded youths approached her property on Almond Tree Avenue in Coventry, at around 10
30pm last Wednesday and began hurling eggs at her windows and a brick at her car A terrified mum-of-two has said she and her two autistic sons have been left 'on edge after her home was wrongly targeted in an attack
The woman, who has not been named, claims two hooded youths approached her property on Almond Tree Avenue in Coventry, at around 10
30pm last Wednesday and began hurling eggs at her windows
A few minutes later, after hearing a noise sounding like someone had been shot, she realised the rear windscreen of her car had been shattered by a brick
It is said to have caused both emotional and financial distress for the victim as the car that was damaged was a courtesy car that she was using while her own vehicle was being repaired
She told CoventryLive : A neighbour came down, heard the noise, thought someone had been shot
Initially I thought just eggs had been thrown at the house, then I realised my car had been damaged
Speaking about the emotional impact the random attack has had on her family, the victim said: I live alone with my two autistic boys, one has just turned 21 and the egg hit his bedroom window
He is very on edge
She believes that her home was wrongly targeted, saying: I believe it may be mistaken address for a targeted attack, as we rarely go out or interact with people locally - keep ourselves to ourselves
A spokesman for West Midlands Police said: We've received a report of criminal damage after a brick was thrown at a car in Almond Tree Avenue, Coventry, at 10
20pm on Wednesday (April 13)

Young Layth Maumoniat, a year even at Allerton High School, was said to have been 'emotional and screaming' before he was found dead by his older sister
Grieving dad Ali Maumoniat told LeedsLive : We've lost him and we feel empty
He was the funniest lad and the personality in our household

Allah gave me my beautiful boy Layth 12 years ago but sadly I today have to return him back to his Lord where he'll be with the rest of the angels and reunited with his mum
In 2020, at just 10 years old, Layth lost his mum to suicide and often struggled after his mother's death, Ali said
I just cannot imagine what was going through his head at that moment
I think all he was thinking was that he'll be back with his mum, he said
May the angels lift you in their wings and take you to the highest paradise my beautiful little lion

Savvy teen Sam Badger, 17, who made a staggering £20,000 selling personalised phone cases from his bedroom in Tamworth, Staffordshire, was bullied in primary school and told he wouldn't amount to anything A teen entrepreneur with autism who was told he'd never succeed has made a staggering £20,000 by selling phone cases from the bedroom of his family home
Sam Badger, 17, from Tamworth in Staffordshire, launched OnTheCase4U just 18 months and has shifted over 4,000 personalised cases since
The savvy teen has even opened a vending machine stocked with his products in Birmingham's Bullring shopping centre, Birmingham Live reports
Sam's designs have taken the internet by storm - and he's drummed up nearly 600,000 followers on TikTok with his popular videos - that have been watched nearly 20 million times
The 17-year-old spotted a gap in the market after trying to find a phone case online for himself
He then set up OnTheCase4U - offering high-quality, customisable phone cases
Working with his mum, Sam transfers unique designs onto blank cases using a printing press before shipping them off to customers
After being bullied at primary school and told he’d never amount to anything, Sam - who was diagnosed with and ADHD aged seven - said he wanted to ‘inspire’ children with learning difficulties
At primary school I was bullied quite a bit and the teachers didn’t have a clue about my autism , Sam said
I want to help raise a bit of awareness and show parents of autistic children that their kids are capable of achieving great things
I had a hard start at most schools with a lot of naughty behaviour, but I always knew I was capable of things
People were telling me I wasn’t going to ever succeed or that I had no potential, but I used that as extra motivation
And now I’ve turned things around and put the same energy I used to put into being naughty into my business, and I’m determined to make it work
Sam, who attends a specialist sixth form college, has never studied business but has come up with a ‘unique’ approach to selling his cases using vending machines
In only a few weeks, he has already made nearly £300 from his spot in the Bullring and plans to open more machines in Manchester’s Arndale shopping centre and Piccadilly train station
When you’re looking for a case, you want it there and then, the teenager said
You don’t want to have to wait for postage
So I thought, why not bring it to the comfort of people’s own shopping centres so they can get it there and then? It’s just so much more convenient
Over the past 18 months, Sam’s business has been doing a roaring trade - but the teen says empowering people with learning difficulties is ‘far more important’ to him than making a profit
There’s a lot of unfilled potential in the autistic community, he said
A lot of parents of children with autism and ADHD say their kids aren't being encouraged enough to succeed
And I've had autistic people on TikTok message me saying they’ve been forced to give up hobbies and not follow their passions
I hope my story inspires them not to give up - no matter what anyone says

Brian Temple's mum described her son as happy go lucky but said the ordeal of incorrectly naming him as a paedophile caused him to become closed off and depressed An inquest heard how a man took his own life after police wrongly named him as a paedophile as a result of human error
Brian Temple was just 34-years-old when he died on December 31, 2017 - six months after being arrested on June 8 for allegedly stealing a pack of sausage rolls from Greggs
The inquest opened on Monday, June 20, and it heard that upon arriving home from custody, Mr Temple gave his release papers to his then-girlfriend, TeessideLive reports
Unbeknown to him, police had made an error in which they produced the wrong information on this document
The letter said he been in custody for inciting sexual relations with a 13-year-old girl, which he had not
Teesside Coroner's Court heard that Mr Temple's then-girlfriend began telling people of the incorrect information, which in turn caused people to lash out at the Redcar man
He was reportedly verbally abused in the street, attacked in his own home and hit around the head by a golf club
To deal with the onslaught he had experienced, the court heard Mr Temple began to drink heavily and take a mixture of both prescribed medication and recreational drugs, such as cocaine
Coroner Claire Bailey explained that a toxicology report carried out by Dr Cooper found Brian had 134mg of alcohol in his system
He was also found with a mixture of cocaine, Diazepam, Zopiclone and Pregablin - but these did not contribute to his death
Dr Cooper concluded that Mr Temple's death was as a result of hanging
His body was found by his brother Anthony, after his mum's partner, Paul Daley, became concerned that they had not heard from him all day
Coroner officer Nick Owen read statements from Mr Temple's brother Paul, sister in law Crystal and mum Mrs McLachlan, who has since passed away
His mum described her son as happy go lucky but admitted the ordeal with incorrect release papers caused him to become closed off and depressed
The court heard that after news spread of the release papers, Mr Temple reported threats and assaults to the police
The force's welfare checks reportedly made this worse and somewhat fuelled the fire of the incorrect rumours
His brother Paul, who was in attendance at the inquest at Teesside Magistrates Court, spoke of his closeness to his brother and how they'd grown up being anti-drug
Paul explained Mr Temple began taking drugs to cope with the constant attacks and assaults he was experiencing in the months leasing to his passing
Although he had depression, Paul said his brother never indicated suicidal tendencies and said the mistake on the release sheet would drive anyone mad

In her statement, Mr Temple's sister-in-law Crystal said the mistaken charge sheet was found in his pocket at the time of his death
She said she believed the police had a duty of care for vulnerable people such as her brother-in-law, as he was suffering from mental health issues at the time of his arrest
Officer Owen read out numerous statements from police officers who had dealt with Mr Temple in the run up to his death and around the time of his arrest and the incorrect papers being issued
Detective Sergeant Agar of Cleveland Police said in his statement that he had dealt with Mr Temple's complaint of the incorrect papers on November 28, 2017, and had said the bail sheet was a genuine human error
The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) began an investigation after Mr Temple's passing, so an error like this one would never happen again at Cleveland Police
They concluded that human error was the main judgement of the papers and this occurrence was incredibly unusual.  The inquest continues

Kristian Jones, 12, has trouble sleeping and mum Gemma Jones sees her son change from a 'happy and smiley' boy to someone who will hurt them both at night A boy with autism hurts his mum and himself during sleepless nights caused by frustration
Kristian, a 12-year-old, has trouble sleeping and mum Gemma Jones sees her son change from a happy and smiley boy to someone who will hurt them both at night, Those who have Autism Spectrum Disorder can have sleep issues
It can lead to daytime tiredness, learning problems and behaviour concerns such as aggression and hyperactivity, The sleep issues affect other members of the family but also other family members and he repeatedly awakes in the night
Gemma hopes to raise money for a specialist bed, which cannot be funded by the NHS, she hopes will provide a safe space for Kristian
She told WalesOnline : Kristian was diagnosed with autism when he was two years old
The only way he can go to sleep is if I lie next to him, otherwise he would be up and about in the house, causing damage or chaos
Sometimes, he has bad days where he doesn't go to sleep before 5 o'clock in the morning and I'm left black and blue - he doesn't realise he's taking his frustration out
She added: It can happen seven days a week sometimes
He goes to stay with his dad over the weekends purely so I can sleep more than two hours and I can spend time with the other kids
It can be particularly challenging when he doesn't go to sleep until 5 or 6 o'clock in morning and I have to wake him at 8 to go to school - he's shattered
The summer holiday is the hardest time because obviously you are with him day and night
Whereas when he’s not on holiday and he’s in school, if he doesn’t sleep at all at night, I know I can get a couple of hours sleep in the day
In the summer holiday, I don’t have that option - once he’s up, he’s up
It does get draining and I’m so tired
When you’re tired, you’re prone to things like colds and cold sores
I’m constantly at the doctors getting cream because I come out a lot with cold sores when I’m tired or stressed
But also, you’re stressed for him - you can see his body wants to go to sleep but his body is still active
He’s frustrated and you understand why he’s frustrated and lashing out because he can’t switch off - it’s heartbreaking
As Kristian was recently diagnosed with epilepsy, lack of sleep can also cause more seizures
A specialist bed therefore would not only promote safe sleeping, but also a safe space for him during particularly difficult times
Gemma said: The specialist bed would include sensory objects and a camera
In that bed then, if Kristian is having a seizure, for example, I can see over the video
It’s not safe leaving him on his own in his room
So this bed would make it a safer environment for him - it’ll calm him down
I could be in the next room - I could go to bed, read a book or something, while he settles, feels safe and not anxious because he’s trying to go to sleep
It would be life changing for the family as well
The other two are older, it would be nice to be there for them as well, help them with school and other things
It would be nice to do whatever I have to do and know that he is also safe
It’ll be life changing for him and for us as a family
With the aid of her friends and family, Gemma hopes to fundraise for a £5,000 specialist bed for her son, with a walk up Pen-y-Fan set to take place at the beginning of June
The mum-of-three said that the response to the fundraising so far has been heartwarming
She said: Many of my friends and family are raising money, and we have got a lot of people coming together as a community
A specialist bed is over £5,000 - hopefully we’ll have the money and the bed set up by the summer holiday because it’s crucial
He’s a happy and smiley little boy, but obviously like anyone when he gets tired he gets grumpy
This will be life changing for him
When you have a child with disabilities, you feel like you are on your own, especially at 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning, you feel like you are alone there
Like most people, I don’t like asking for help and feel like I should be able to do this by myself
But the fact they are all coming together, without me even asking, it’s so heartwarming
I never thought anyone would go out of their way to do this
They have a lot going on themselves with Covid and their own families
I’d like to thank everybody for the kindness that they have shown

WARNING DISTRESSING CONTENT Eve Lewis, 15, was a popular and bright student but had struggled with anorexia in the latter part of 2020 in her quest for perfection A teenage girl who dreamed of becoming a lawyer went out for a walk with her dog but sadly never returned
Eve Lewis, 15, was hit by a train after going for a wander with her pet instead of out with her family on September 26 last year
The Lancashire schoolgirl dreamed of becoming a lawyer and was predicted top grades in her GCSEs
A popular pupil, Eve's family say she tried her best in everything and had recently discovered a new passion for both art and drama
They were not worried when she told them she would head out to walk the dog instead of joining them on a trip out last year and, while she battled anorexia, at times becoming painfully thin, relatives thought that she was over the worst of it and had her spark back
There was nothing to suggest that when she went out to walk the dog that day, that she wouldn't be coming home again, her family told LancsLive
There were no cries for help
Eve had so many things to look forward to and so many plans for the future
We don’t believe Eve wanted to die; she wanted to put an end to the torment she was in.  That torment was anorexia
Eve died after being hit by a train and her dog was later found running free in a nearby field by a passer-by
The talented youngster, who was in her final year at Burscough Priory Academy, had developed the eating disorder in the latter part of 2020 in her quest for perfection
Her mum Paula noticed she had lost a considerable amount of weight but, initially, Eve still appeared to be eating normal meals at home in Burscough
However, as 2021 started, and Eve was forced to home-school because of lockdown, she became obsessed with her food intake
By the Easter holidays she wouldn't even allow herself to enjoy the Sunday lunch her mum had made and her weight plummeted to less than six stone
By April 2021 mum Paula, a retired police officer, had become so concerned that she took Eve to see the GP who recorded her weight as just 37kg, or five stone eight pounds
The following day she was called by the eating disorder clinic who advised Eve's parents to not allow her to eat low fat food but after that she just refused to eat at all, her mum said
At an inquest at Preston Coroner's Court today, Paula said: We were told to persevere and we would spend hours every day trying to get her to eat
She would be crying, I would be crying and it was absolutely horrendous
It got to the stage where she was terrified of food
She would hold a fork up to her mouth and her hand would be shaking
In May 2021, as Eve's physical condition deteriorated and she became painfully thin, she attended an appointment with the eating disorder service's practitioners and a GP
The doctor was so worried about Eve's low heart rate, caused by starvation, that he sent her to A&E with her family advised to pack a bag as it was likely she would be admitted
Dr Johnstone told the inquest: I was particularly struck by the terrific efforts of mum and dad who had done everything to try and help her
They spoke of spending six hours a day trying to get her to eat
It was a very clear decision to admit her to hospital because despite all of that she was becoming more and more unwell
When she was admitted to Southport and Ormskirk District General Hospital, 15-year-old Eve weighed 36
55kg - five and a half stone
She was only allowed out of bed in a wheelchair because of her frailty and she told medics that she was worried she would lose control in hospital and become fat
She still had a sense of humour though, mum Paula told the inquest
I remember at one point they asked if she had any allergies and she said 'oil, fat, butter, sugar. . . . ' and was joking
After being warned that she would have to have a nasal feeding tube inserted if she continued to refuse food, Eve slowly began to eat while in hospital
By the time she was discharged, four weeks later, she had gained over 5kg
By September Eve, who was born in Ormskirk, had managed to gain more weight and she was deemed well enough to return to school
She asked her mum if she could have highlights put in her hair and her eyebrows tinted so that if anyone says I look different I can say that's why, Eve told Paula
Headteacher Lucy MacLaren described Eve as a beautiful girl' who loved netball and who contributed in every way possible to the school

Eve was desperate to get better and had written a list of fear foods such as Ben & Jerry's ice cream and McDonald's, which she and her mum were ticking off one-by-one as she managed to try them
On the morning of Sunday September 26, the family were due to go out but Eve had stayed at home because she was worried a food situation would present itself and she would feel embarrassed
At lunchtime, Eve took the family dog out for a walk near to the train line close to their home in Ainscough Drive and spent 20 minutes talking to a friend on the phone
Emergency services raced to the scene shortly after 1. 35pm
Hayley Bevan was walking over the same trainline crossing and spotted a dog's lead and dog poo bags placed on the ground
She then walked on and saw the Lewis family dog running free

Just before Eve ran across the tracks she posted a heartbreaking message to her friends on Snapchat in which she thanked them for their support, the inquest heard
Assistant Coroner Laura Nash, who cried as she summarised the evidence, returned a conclusion of suicide
She also requested to see the family after the inquest to speak to them privately
After the inquest, Eve's family said in a statement that she had been tormented by anorexia
They said: Eve was just 15 years, one month and eight days’ old when her life ended
All of the superlatives we could come up with would still not do her justice
She was the most caring, loving, funny little girl who was an absolute pleasure to be around
She brought joy into the lives of everyone lucky enough to know her.  Eve was a perfectionist
She did everything to the best of her ability
She should have been taking her GCSEs this year and her grades were predicted to be 8s and 9s
She wanted to be a lawyer
Eve loved sports and exercise, and she was especially good at gymnastics
She enjoyed drama too, and had recently discovered that she was a talented artist
She had a great network of friends and was very popular at school
Unfortunately, in her quest to be perfect, she became anorexic
She was receiving treatment and improving daily
We thought that she was over the worst of it and had her spark back
There was nothing to suggest that when she went out to walk the dog that day, that she wouldn't be coming home again
There were no cries for help
Eve had so many things to look forward to and so many plans for the future
We don’t believe Eve wanted to die; she wanted to put an end to the torment she was in.  That torment was anorexia
Looking back, we believe that as Eve reached a normal weight range, rather than having her appointments with the eating disorder clinic reduced to once a month, she should have continued to be seen and given the opportunity for counselling without a parent present
Medication should also have been considered to help Eve’s mind cope with the changes, as we were told the brain is the last to recover
What is going wrong in our society that makes children and young adults feel they aren't good enough? They are
We wish Eve knew how wonderful she was
She was loved so much, by so many
We believe that Eve didn't tell us how she was feeling as she didn't want to worry or upset us
In her right frame of mind, she would never, ever have done anything to hurt any of us
We wish things could be different
We wish that we could have saved her

The talented youngster, who was in her final year at Burscough Priory Academy, had developed the eating disorder in the latter part of 2020 in her quest for perfection
Her mum Paula noticed she had lost a considerable amount of weight but, initially, Eve still appeared to be eating normal meals at home in Burscough
However, as 2021 started, and Eve was forced to home-school because of lockdown, she became obsessed with her food intake
By the Easter holidays she wouldn't even allow herself to enjoy the Sunday lunch her mum had made and her weight plummeted to less than six stone
By April 2021 mum Paula, a retired police officer, had become so concerned that she took Eve to see the GP who recorded her weight as just 37kg, or five stone eight pounds
The following day she was called by the eating disorder clinic who advised Eve's parents to not allow her to eat low fat food but after that she just refused to eat at all, her mum said
At an inquest at Preston Coroner's Court today, Paula said: We were told to persevere and we would spend hours every day trying to get her to eat
She would be crying, I would be crying and it was absolutely horrendous
It got to the stage where she was terrified of food
She would hold a fork up to her mouth and her hand would be shaking
In May 2021, as Eve's physical condition deteriorated and she became painfully thin, she attended an appointment with the eating disorder service's practitioners and a GP
The doctor was so worried about Eve's low heart rate, caused by starvation, that he sent her to A&E with her family advised to pack a bag as it was likely she would be admitted
Dr Johnstone told the inquest: I was particularly struck by the terrific efforts of mum and dad who had done everything to try and help her
They spoke of spending six hours a day trying to get her to eat
It was a very clear decision to admit her to hospital because despite all of that she was becoming more and more unwell
When she was admitted to Southport and Ormskirk District General Hospital, 15-year-old Eve weighed 36
55kg - five and a half stone
She was only allowed out of bed in a wheelchair because of her frailty and she told medics that she was worried she would lose control in hospital and become fat
She still had a sense of humour though, mum Paula told the inquest
I remember at one point they asked if she had any allergies and she said 'oil, fat, butter, sugar. . . . ' and was joking
After being warned that she would have to have a nasal feeding tube inserted if she continued to refuse food, Eve slowly began to eat while in hospital
By the time she was discharged, four weeks later, she had gained over 5kg
By September Eve, who was born in Ormskirk, had managed to gain more weight and she was deemed well enough to return to school
She asked her mum if she could have highlights put in her hair and her eyebrows tinted so that if anyone says I look different I can say that's why, Eve told Paula
Headteacher Lucy MacLaren described Eve as a beautiful girl' who loved netball and who contributed in every way possible to the school

Eve was desperate to get better and had written a list of fear foods such as Ben & Jerry's ice cream and McDonald's, which she and her mum were ticking off one-by-one as she managed to try them
On the morning of Sunday September 26, the family were due to go out but Eve had stayed at home because she was worried a food situation would present itself and she would feel embarrassed
At lunchtime, Eve took the family dog out for a walk near to the train line close to their home in Ainscough Drive and spent 20 minutes talking to a friend on the phone
Emergency services raced to the scene shortly after 1. 35pm
Hayley Bevan was walking over the same trainline crossing and spotted a dog's lead and dog poo bags placed on the ground
She then walked on and saw the Lewis family dog running free

Just before Eve ran across the tracks she posted a heartbreaking message to her friends on Snapchat in which she thanked them for their support, the inquest heard
Assistant Coroner Laura Nash, who cried as she summarised the evidence, returned a conclusion of suicide
She also requested to see the family after the inquest to speak to them privately
After the inquest, Eve's family said in a statement that she had been tormented by anorexia
They said: Eve was just 15 years, one month and eight days’ old when her life ended
All of the superlatives we could come up with would still not do her justice
She was the most caring, loving, funny little girl who was an absolute pleasure to be around
She brought joy into the lives of everyone lucky enough to know her.  Eve was a perfectionist
She did everything to the best of her ability
She should have been taking her GCSEs this year and her grades were predicted to be 8s and 9s
She wanted to be a lawyer
Eve loved sports and exercise, and she was especially good at gymnastics
She enjoyed drama too, and had recently discovered that she was a talented artist
She had a great network of friends and was very popular at school
Unfortunately, in her quest to be perfect, she became anorexic
She was receiving treatment and improving daily
We thought that she was over the worst of it and had her spark back
There was nothing to suggest that when she went out to walk the dog that day, that she wouldn't be coming home again
There were no cries for help
Eve had so many things to look forward to and so many plans for the future
We don’t believe Eve wanted to die; she wanted to put an end to the torment she was in.  That torment was anorexia
Looking back, we believe that as Eve reached a normal weight range, rather than having her appointments with the eating disorder clinic reduced to once a month, she should have continued to be seen and given the opportunity for counselling without a parent present
Medication should also have been considered to help Eve’s mind cope with the changes, as we were told the brain is the last to recover
What is going wrong in our society that makes children and young adults feel they aren't good enough? They are
We wish Eve knew how wonderful she was
She was loved so much, by so many
We believe that Eve didn't tell us how she was feeling as she didn't want to worry or upset us
In her right frame of mind, she would never, ever have done anything to hurt any of us
We wish things could be different
We wish that we could have saved her

A dad in Orlando, in the US, is believed to have killed his wife and three daughters in a suspected murder-suicide
Donovan Michael Ramirez and his family were found dead at their home A dad is accused of brutally executing his family before turning the gun on himself in a murder-suicide
Donovan Michael Ramirez, 45, allegedly murdered his three daughters and wife in a disturbing murder-suicide in Orlando, Florida, in the US
Victims of the attack were daughters Alyssa Berumen, 22, Sunny Ramirez, 11, and Shelby Rose Ramirez, 7, and they were killed alongside their mum, 39-year-old Renee Ramirez
The family was found dead on Tuesday after they were called to conduct a welfare check on Tuesday, August 4
Police have not yet confirmed the cause of death of the victims and one of the officers is said to have stepped outside the house after he became sick when he saw the grisly scene on Lake District Lane in Lake Nona
They have, however, admitted the incident was likely a domestic abuse case
Local law enforcement said: At this time, it appears this is a domestic violence-related incident
Investigators worked overnight to gather as much information as possible
As this is still an active and ongoing investigation, no further updates will be provided at this time
It was confirmed a gun was recovered from the scene, but police are still waiting on reports from medical examiners to release more information
The family were killed at the home they had moved into in 2020 and locals have expressed their complete shock over what took place
Nearby residents said they suspected nothing out of the ordinary or anything strange was going on before the killings occurred
Sunny's friends Katelyn Rampersad and Amarie Padovani attended Northlake Park Community School
Both 11, they said she made them feel at home in Florida
Neighbour Heather Collins told WESH: I think it's like a worst nightmare truly
I don't even know what happened exactly
My heart goes out to the family
I can't even begin to wrap my mind around any of this, especially if there were family involved
Justin Rossilini said: They seemed like they were a normal family
I seen the dad, seen the mom, and two little girls
I didn't hear anything, I wish I did
I definitely would have liked to have been that concerned neighbour that did something in this situation
According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 45,222 people died from gun-related injuries in the US in 20202 alone
Around 46 per cent of the deaths were not suicide-related

Craig Cambridge, 51, saw his life spiralling downwards after his daughter, Leah, died following a botched Brazilian butt lift in 2018 and tragically took his own life A dad took his own life after his daughter died following a botched Brazilian butt lift operation in Turkey
Craig Cambridge, 51, found his life spiralling downwards after his 29-year-old daughter Leah Cambridge died following a 2018 operation in Turkey that went wrong
The dad was tragically found dead at his home in Leeds and an inquest has found how he had never been able to get over Leah’s awful death
On the day he died, he had tried to ring doctors three times before his death but they had been closed because it was a bank holiday, Leeds Live reports
After an investigation into his death, senior coroner Kevin McLoughlin said he would be contacting the surgeon who botched Leah’s operation
Craig struggled with alcohol dependency and depression after his daughter’s tragic death, Wakefield Coroners' Court heard
On April, 5, 2021, his daughter's partner found Craig dead in his loft
This came nearly three years after Leah died in Izmir, Turkey, in August 2018
She died from a pulmonary embolism after Dr Ali Uckan accidentally injected fat into her veins
Leah had three heart attacks at the operating table
Mr McLoughlin conducted the inquests for the dad and daughter and said he wanted to let Dr Ali Uckan know the damage his surgery caused
He said to Craig's daughters Hayley and Chelsea and ex-partner Theresa Hall: Normally I am quite detached and hard-hearted about inquests, but when I saw another tragedy had befallen your family, I felt quite grievous
Having conducted the inquest into Leah all those years ago, I was incensed that the surgeon in Turkey stood well clear
I am proposing to send the report to the surgeon to make him aware of the tentacles of this
I am intending to send it to the medical authorities in Turkey to make them aware of how a tragedy manifests itself years later
I feel dreadfully sorry for you as a family
Chelsea and her partner had gone to see him on April 5, 2021, but when they were unable to get in, Chelsea’s partner ended up climbing through a window

It was then he found the body of the former personal trainer and called paramedics
Craig was tragically pronounced dead at 7:50pm that evening
He had left notes for both his daughters
Craig had a history of depression and anxiety that became much worse after Leah’s death
He had been on medication and turned to alcohol and was under the care of a community mental health team
Police also found that the morning he took his own life he had tried to call doctors three times, but they were closed because it was a bank holiday
Dr Uckan did speak at Leah's inquest, where he called the operation a guessing game, speaking to Leah's widower Scott
Mr McLoughlin branded the surgeon a coward back in 2019 for not answering her family's questions
The coroner said that he had written to the doctor eight times since to ask him to give evidence at Craig's inquest - but got no response
As he returned a verdict of suicide today, Mr McLoughlin said: I am reliant upon on the pathologist for the cause of death, which in this case is hanging
This was a suicide attributed in part to the death of his daughter who died in surgery in Turkey

Silvija Snipkute, 31, who was a mum-of-one and had five siblings, was described as the strongest person but tragically took her own life after she booked into a hotel room in London A loving young mum was found dead in her hotel room after staff noticed she hadn’t checked out
Silvija Snipkute was discovered dead by cleaning staff at the Bank Hotel in Barking, after she failed to check out that morning
An inquest heard how she tragically took her own life
After they noticed the 31-year-old’s door was locked, staff retrieved a key - but sadlt they found the young mum dead inside, around 11:30am on February 15, My London reported
Medics from the London Ambulance Service declared her dead at the scene
Met Police officers also attended the scene and were informed she had arrived the previous evening and was due to leave that morning
However, the mum had been reported missing when her partner Tomas notified police that she had failed to return home
An inquest heard how the mum had taken herself to a private space where she wouldn’t be interrupted to take her own life
An examination of CCTV showed that nobody else had entered her hotel room since she arrived at 9:49pm and her death was deemed non-suspicious
An inquest at Waltham Forest Coroners Court on June 6 heard that shortly after Silvija was discovered, officers were made aware that the woman in the room was identical to a woman who had been reported missing
A very sad note was found in her hotel room which Coroner Graeme Irvine said was a note of intent indicating that she had intended to take her own life
What is happening where you live? Find out by adding your postcode
A post-mortem examination found that Silvija, a warehouse operative from Dagenham, had no natural diseases, whilst a toxicology report found traces of alcohol and cocaine in her blood and urine
Mr Irvine said: It seems clear to me that Silvija did something that caused her own death, which was tying a ligature around her neck and hanging herself
It also appears to me that Silvija had taken herself to a place where she wouldn’t be interrupted, that would be private
There’s no indication from her actions that she was hoping someone would interrupt her or save her
I don’t think this was a cry for help
He continued: There is sufficient evidence to formulate a conclusion of suicide in this inquest
In a heartbreaking tribute to the mum, her sister-in-law Gabriella called her the strongest person she had known who was always helping others
She said: She was the eldest of five children
Silvija had a simple childhood although had several depression episodes as a teenager, nonetheless she continued to live and work in Lithuania
She moved to the UK several years ago
Living in London, she met her partner Tomas and her daughter was born from this union
Silvija always loved working and she was always helping others
She was a kind, loving mother, sister and friend
She was the strongest person we all ever knew but she heartbreakingly lost her battle with depression
Silvija will be forever remembered and loved by her mother, her siblings, her partner, her daughter and her friends
A GoFundMe to raise money for her family succeeded in raising over £3,000 after she died

Baggage handler Richard Russell, 29, was wearing a T-shirt with The Sky's No Limit written on his back as he opened the door of an Alaskan Airlines propeller jet, jumped in the cockpit and flew 30 miles before taking his own life when he crashed on a remote island A clip has surfaced showing the moment an airport worker hijacked a plane before plunging the aircraft through the air and crash landing on a remote island in an apparent suicide
Surveillance footage from Seattle Airport shows baggage handler Richard Russell, 29, moving through the transit hub wearing a a T-shirt with The Sky's No Limit emblazoned across the back
The clip, recorded in August 2018, then shows Russell heading towards the airport's cargo area around five hours after clearing security
With colleagues walking nearby, he's seen pushing an Alaska Airlines propeller aircraft on to the runway
Air traffic agents tried to make contact with the plane but received no response
He then opens the cabin door, jumps in the cockpit and takes off in the Q400 Turboprop - which is designed for short to medium haul journeys
He tells air traffic control: Seattle ground Horizon guy.  About to take off.  It's gonna be crazy
Hey, I found myself in a predicament
I'm in the air right now
And just gonna soar around
As he soars above Washington state as air traffic controllers beg him to make a safe landing
But Russell won't be swayed and continues to make disturbing jokes with the men in the tower trying to find somewhere he can set the plane down
He says: Hey do you think if I land this successfully Alaska will give me a job as a pilot? After asking if he could see a suitable runway, he replies: Oh those guys will try to rough me up if I try land there… I think I might mess something up there too
I wouldn't want to do that
Oh they probably have got anti-aircraft
The traffic controller responds: They don't have any of that stuff, we are just trying to find you a place to land safely
At one point, he says he's just a broken guy and that he is preparing for jail time for life
According to the Seattle Times, he said he feared disappointing people that care about me by hijacking the aircraft
He added: I would like to apologise to each and every one of them
Just a broken guy, got a few screws loose, I guess
Never really knew it, until now
Moments after the plane took off, two US F-15 fighter jets headed to his position but couldn't intercept him before his tragic descent
Russell crashed on a remote island 30 miles away from Seattle
He died around 90 minutes after taking off
People on the ground reported seeing him performing aerial acrobatics, including barrel rolls and loop-the-loops in the air
Sheriff Paul Pastor said Russell's was like a joyride gone terribly wrong
An FBI report revealed how Russell said he knew how to fly the aircraft solo because he'd played video games in the past
The report said there was no clear motivation for his bizarre actions after investigators probed his background, possible stressors and personal life

Billy Baxter, 16, from Blackburn, needed life-saving surgery after being knifed in the heart and lungs and now has a 12-inch scar running down the length of his chest An autistic teen who stayed inside his home for over 2 years due to social anxiety was brutally stabbed while venturing out for just the second time
Billy Baxter, 16, from Blackburn, was knifed in the heart and lungs on the evening of September 17 last year while walking near his home in what is believed to be a row over a girl
He had to undergo life-saving surgery after the attack and has since been left with a 12-inch scar running down the length of his chest
His mum Jessie Brian, 35, found out about the attack when Billy messaged her on Snapchat to say he was on his way to hospital
She said the teen had been left traumatised by the incident and the family now plans to move out of the area
His 17 year-old attacker - who cannot be named for legal reasons - was sentenced to just 28 months in custody for the offence last week
He was originally charged with attempted murder but this was downgraded to wounding with intent by the Crown Prosecution Service
Jessie hit out at the sentence, calling it a slap on the wrist while Billy had been forced to turn his back on his life and ambitions
Billy wanted to be a plumber and now he's too scared to go out of the house just when he got his confidence back, she said
It's heart-breaking what he's done to my son, and in court, he held his head up high like nothing had happened
I've been around this area for 35 years - it's the only area that I've known - and now we have to leave because the attacker knows my address and so does his family
Billy has ADHD and autism and had spent more than two years without leaving his girlfriend's house due to his lifelong developmental disability
But they broke up shortly before the attack on September 17 last year and Billy moved back home with Jessie
He was ambushed after leaving the house at around 6
45pm to meet up with a new love interest
Jessie said: He'd been in a relationship, and he'd found out she was cheating on him, so he came back home after isolating with her for two and a half years
I said to Billy, Just get out there! You need to start socialising with people and making new friends
Forget about everything that's happened
So he'd met this young girl, and managed to get to town and to see her, but then he heard his name being shouted across the road
He put his hood down and didn't want any trouble, but next thing he knew the lad was in front of his face, and he got stabbed straight in the chest
Jessie said she found out about the stabbing after Billy contacted her over messaging platform Snapchat in the minutes after it took place
She said: I got a phone call from one of his friends on Snapchat, and it was actually Billy on the phone saying that he had been stabbed
I thought it was someone having a joke because it didn't sound like Billy
It was only when he said: It is me, mum, I've been stabbed and I'm on my way to the hospital, that's when I found out
Billy was rushed to hospital where he required a life-saving operation after doctors found out he had internal bleeding
Jessie said: He was stabbed in the chest, between his heart and his liver
It pierced his heart, as well as cutting through a tube that runs from his heart for the blood supply, and slashing his liver
They had to open him up and pull his rib cage back and do an operation on his heart, and they had to repair the tube as well
It was an operation that he had to have within 24 hours - a life-saving operation - because he had internal bleeding as well, which is very, very dangerous
She added: It was a nightmare to tell you the truth, it really was a nightmare
Billy was left with a huge scar running down his chest, along with a couple of smaller ones dotted just above his stomach
But Jessie said that the poor lad was also left with mental trauma, which continues to this day
She said: My 16-year-old who wanted to go to college and be a plumber hasn't got a life now because he won't go out
He feels very conscious about the scars
He talks about it every single day
It's not just one little scar
It's one big massive scar and two scars underneath it
Jessie also feels the sentence that her son's attacker received won't deter other kids from carrying knives in the future
She said: 28 months is a slap on the hand
This boy who did all this will probably get out and get a job or whatever, and my son is left not knowing what to do next
Get email updates with the day's biggest stories Billy Baxter, 16, from Blackburn, needed life-saving surgery after being knifed in the heart and lungs and now has a 12-inch scar running down the length of his chest An autistic teen who stayed inside his home for over 2 years due to social anxiety was brutally stabbed while venturing out for just the second time
Billy Baxter, 16, from Blackburn, was knifed in the heart and lungs on the evening of September 17 last year while walking near his home in what is believed to be a row over a girl
He had to undergo life-saving surgery after the attack and has since been left with a 12-inch scar running down the length of his chest
His mum Jessie Brian, 35, found out about the attack when Billy messaged her on Snapchat to say he was on his way to hospital
She said the teen had been left traumatised by the incident and the family now plans to move out of the area
His 17 year-old attacker - who cannot be named for legal reasons - was sentenced to just 28 months in custody for the offence last week
He was originally charged with attempted murder but this was downgraded to wounding with intent by the Crown Prosecution Service
Jessie hit out at the sentence, calling it a slap on the wrist while Billy had been forced to turn his back on his life and ambitions
Billy wanted to be a plumber and now he's too scared to go out of the house just when he got his confidence back, she said
It's heart-breaking what he's done to my son, and in court, he held his head up high like nothing had happened
I've been around this area for 35 years - it's the only area that I've known - and now we have to leave because the attacker knows my address and so does his family
Billy has ADHD and autism and had spent more than two years without leaving his girlfriend's house due to his lifelong developmental disability
But they broke up shortly before the attack on September 17 last year and Billy moved back home with Jessie
He was ambushed after leaving the house at around 6
45pm to meet up with a new love interest
Jessie said: He'd been in a relationship, and he'd found out she was cheating on him, so he came back home after isolating with her for two and a half years

Autistic Larsson Hankins only drinks water from an Evian bottle and was pulled form Bude Park Primary School when he was tricked into drinking it from a tap as part of a game A furious mum removed her autistic son from school when he said he was forced to drink tap water in a game, despite teachers knowing he only drinks juice or from an Evian bottle
Marie Donnelly says a staff member spotted her son Larsson Hankins, seven, not drinking from the school’s reusable bottle and took him out of class to play a game
She accused them of lying to her son, claiming her son was told he had to have a drink as his mum was concerned which she refutes every saying
Larsson - who only drinks juice or Evian, was presented two cups of water and asked to guess which was from a tap
When he could not determine which was which, Marie alleges Larrson was told they were both tap water, leaving him in tears when he got back to class, Hull Live reported
Maries, 36, from Hull said: As Larsson is autistic, he struggles socially and for him to be alone in a room with a staff member he doesn't know well and to be pressured into having to drink water will have caused him a lot of stress
He told me he cried when he got back to class and he cried again when he got home
School life is already hard for Larsson, so I don't like that they're making things harder for him, especially the way he was spoken to
I'll do whatever I have to do to make him happy and make school less stressful for him
When his dad went into school to complain the family claims he was told autistic kids drink water to which he replied: This one doesn’t
In response to the claims, Bude Park Primary School said: Staff and governors of the school are committed to safeguarding and promoting the health and welfare of its children
This year, the school purchased water bottles for all of its pupils
These bottles are kept in school and ensures all children have access to plenty of safe drinking water throughout the school day
The school prides itself on being inclusive and endeavours to support every child regardless of their level of need
The school has accommodated pupils who have found the transition to water-only more difficult and will continue to work with parents and pupils to ensure that all children are appropriately supported to make healthy choices
Whilst this initiative has been widely supported, the school encourages those parents who have concerns to raise these with the headteacher and/or via the school’s complaints policy

Anne Deegan Hunt, from Southport, Merseyside, said she was left 'distraught' when a KFC manager refused to turn off the loud music which left her autistic granddaughter screaming The family of a disabled girl with autism claim they were left distraught and forced to leave a KFC restaurant when staff refused to turn off their loud music
Anne Deegan Hunt, 61, from Southport, Merseyside, was taking her daughter, Leila, nine, for a day out to the Eastbank Street branch of the fast food train restaurant on Saturday, March 26
But the grandmother of eight said Leila who has learning disabilities and autism was left screaming from the table tops when a staff member refused to turn off their in store music
Speaking to the Liverpool ECHO she said: Leila had managed to get on to a table and was screaming for the music to be turned down
The whole shop could hear her
I explained she was autistic and asked the employee at the counter if he could turn the music off
He told me he would have to talk to the manager
Distressed Leila began hitting herself as they waited for the music to stop playing Anne claims
But when the employee returned, Anne said that the manager had relayed a message that the music could only be turned down not off
She said: Anne had started punching her stomach
She has a Stoma had so she was at risk of causing serious harm to herself
The employee was really understating and he apologised but the manager didn't even come out to see what was going on
Leila who also has Goldenhar Syndrome and suffers with social anxiety can find it difficult to find activities she enjoys doing outside of the house
Her gran added: Because of her autism she has built up anxiety about going out and she only enjoys doing certain things
I was more upset for Leila because that's one of the few thigs that she likes to do
Anne eventually managed to get Leila off the table but had no choice but to leave said: I don't think turning the music off would have spoiled anybody's dining experience
It's probably more distressing to watch a child in that state
As they wouldn't turn the music off the situation was just getting worse
I was left feeling distraught and Leila's disability wasn't accommodated at all
A KFC spokesperson said: We’re really sorry we didn’t get this one right
We want our restaurants to be a welcoming place for everyone, and we’ve followed up with the team to ensure it doesn’t happen again
We’d like to make it up to the family and would love for them to get in touch with our Care Squad to give us the chance

Mum Nicola Caine from Cheshire slammed airline easyJet saying 'you wouldn’t even treat animals the way we have been treated after the family faced a string of problems, including two flight cancellations, multiple delays and no overnight accommodation A mum of an autistic child has told how her family was made to wait for two hours on the runway in an easyJet plane only to be then told the flight had been cancelled
Nicola Caine said they were due to fly from Manchester Airport to Tenerife at 5
10pm on Monday, but that the trip that they had been waiting for two years to go on, quickly turned sour, the Manchester Evening News reported
The Cheshire mum has told of her nightmare experience which included the flight being cancelled twice and her family being forced to sleep on airport floors
She was travelling with her husband and two children, with the cancellation causing a huge meltdown for her 12-year-old son who has autism, it is reported
First, the passengers were told that the flight was delayed by an hour, until 6
10pm, and Ms Caine said they had arrived at 2pm so as to be there with plenty of time
Then while they were able to board the plane just after 6pm, the waiting continued as there were problems with German airspace and then over baggage
She said: We were sat on the plane for an hour and a half
A pilot came and said ‘unfortunately, due to staff going over their hours, we are going to have to cancel this flight
’ The reaction on the plane wasn’t good at all
My son broke down in tears and screamed the plane down
Then we were told we couldn’t get off the plane because an Emirates plane had just arrived, and they take priority
So we sat on the plane for another 30 minutes
Luckily, the staff on the plane were really good, they let us go to the front of the plane to calm my son down
The problems for the Caine family continued after they got off the easyJet plane as they claimed they were stuck at Manchester Airport without information
She added Manchester Airport staff advised passengers to download the easyJet app to rebook new flights
But this was not without issues according to Nicola
She added: Everyone was trying to get on the app, but it was crashing
No-one could get on it at all
The app didn't work because we were on a package holiday
While we were stood there, two cancelled easyJet flights came through from Turkey and Egypt
So we were left, all these people from three flights, not knowing what would happen
Luckily, we live 30 minutes from the airport, so we decided to come home
We didn’t know whether to unpack because we didn't know whether we would be going on holiday or not
At 5:30am, Nicola received a text, telling her to be at Manchester Airport for 10:30am, where a coach would take them to Gatwick Airport to catch a flight to Tenerife at 7:10pm that evening
We were absolutely devastated, Nicola explained
We had not slept all night because my son was crying
I just thought, how can I go on a coach for almost five hours and sit in an airport for three hours, and then go on a four and a half hour flight? EasyJet said it was a suitable alternative and that we would lose our money if we didn'tgo on that trip
After arriving at Gatwick Airport, 240 miles away, Nicola booked her son an antigen test as his PCR had run out
At the gate, waiting to board the flight to Tenerife, the passengers had to wait over 30 minutes while the plane was cleaned
They were then told by easyJet that they could no longer operate the flight, but stand-by crew would be there for the flight in an hour
The family were then asked to return to departures, which raised alarm bells for Nicola, who suspected that the flight would be cancelled
She said: I questioned the staff because I knew this had happened the night before
They assured me that everything was fine
But we had to go back to departures, which was a tell-tale sign that we weren’t getting back on the plane
So we went back to departures and stood at the customer service desk for another 45 minutes
Again, there were no easyJet people there
At 9pm, we all got an email to say the flight was cancelled
The passengers were asked to move to another gate and look at new flights on the easyJet app, which angered Nicola
I was so angry because Ihad heard it all the night before, she continued
I told the staff, this happened at Manchester Airport, we cannot book new flights on the app because we are have a package holiday
A police officer advised us to stay in a hotel overnight
We said, why should we have to do that, t here should be a level of service
The nearest hotel was £690 for the night
We came back to the terminal and met the other passengers, not knowing whether we were going to fly, or get taxis for another four hours to go home- because what if easyJet book us another flight?

Her 60-year-old mum and children were forced to lay on the floor and across dining table chairs in a bid to get some rest
It was an absolute nightmare, Nicola described.  It was freezing cold
My husband and I had to lay on the floor
EasyJet didn't even provide food vouchers
The children were tired and upset

A spokesperson for easyJet told the Manchester Evening News: Unfortunately, we were unable to operate the EZY1903 from Manchester to Tenerife on Monday, due to air traffic control restrictions earlier in the day leading to the crew reaching their maximum operating hours
We’re very sorry that the flight the family transferred on to from Gatwick was also cancelled

Billie Charity hit rock-bottom following the tragic death of her brother Stan
Here, the 47-year-old explains how focusing on her passion for photography helped her grieve and build a new life My most precious memories of my younger brother Stan are of us as kids
He was happy, beautiful and the sweetest boy in the world.  I adored him
We’d spend hours playing Lego and Monopoly together, and remained close into adulthood
I hold these memories close now – the boy he was and the relationship we had before his mental illness took hold in his thirties
Our parents separated when we were little
My dad would travel to an off-grid cottage in a remote valley near our home in Herefordshire to spend time with us
He was a fashion photographer and I still treasure the pictures he took of those sunny days
My mum also took wonderful photos of us, capturing family Christmases and our amazing garden, which she filled with sunflowers one year
Photography was a huge passion for the whole family
When Stan and I grew up, we lived together in London
I loved working at the BBC Learning department doing PR
But Stan never seemed happy and he returned to Herefordshire to live with Mum
I took photos all the time and my now-husband Dave and I would always take our cameras out at weekends
After a few visits back to Herefordshire, Dave fell in love with the area
He got on really well with Stan, which made me happy
I was feeling broody and the countryside felt like a better option, so we moved back and lived with Mum and my brother for a couple of years
I remember that time fondly
We ate together every night and took turns to cook
We played board games and pool, watched family TV favourites
Most importantly, we talked and reminisced
Some time later, unbeknown to any of us, my brother developed a serious mental illness
I’d had my first daughter and was suffering postnatal depression
Mum was also diagnosed with MS – things were pretty heavy
Me and Stan grew apart
I had another daughter shortly afterwards
I know Stan loved them both but I couldn’t understand why he appeared to have little interest in them and I resented this
He once told them they could have his old car as a play den
He once played pool with them, once bounced on the trampoline with them, once invited them to watch Scooby-Doo
But these gestures were few and far between
It became normal that Stan wasn’t very present in our lives
He never opened up to me about his mental illness and his unbearable suffering
Instead, it came out as anger and him not being very nice
Seeing him became deeply upsetting
I desperately missed my brother, my best friend, my confidant
Then, on Easter Sunday 2016, after several years of barely any communication, Stan turned up at my front door.  I was thrilled
We went for a walk but it soon became obvious something was really wrong
He was finally opening up but he was incredibly paranoid
I was happy that he was talking to me again – I was getting my brother back – but I was worried about him
He said he was very anxious and low, and felt something really bad was going to happen but he didn’t know what
I urged him to see a doctor but he convinced me everything was OK
The next weekend, there was a knock on the door in the middle of the night.  It was the police
Stan’s body had been found
He’d taken his life in the cottage where my dad used to take us as children
What happened next is a total blur
The type of grief that comes from sibling suicide is incredibly complex, especially when you’d been as close as Stan and I were
It’s like something outside of you that you have no control of
It hits you over and over, like a tidal wave
Eventually, I found others online who helped me understand what I was going through
Soon after Stan died, Dave and I moved with our daughters (then aged six and nine) back into Mum’s house
Initially, it was hard because there were signs of Stan everywhere
Each anniversary without him – every birthday, Christmas and Easter – brought further tidal waves of grief and I’d spend days in bed
Then, I rediscovered my camera
I had a strong urge to get far away from Herefordshire and took my eldest daughter to Hong Kong to stay with a cousin
I found solace taking photos of the amazing people and places we saw
Back home, photography became one of the ways I learned to live with my grief
A psychotherapist saw the link between my photography and my recovery
I looked up to Stan as a talented photographer – one of our last conversations was about photography
Two days before he died, he said he was happy and proud that I was pursuing my passion – and gave me his camera
Looking back, he obviously knew he wouldn’t be around for much longer.  He was saying goodbye
Six years after Stan’s death, I’m learning to live with the pain
But out of nowhere I can still get a sudden, sharp stabbing in the stomach that’s so powerful I can’t breathe
My physically healthy, handsome, intelligent, sweet, loved and loving brother is dead
And he died by his own hand
Did he realise that he’d never get to drive his beloved Alfa Romeo again, or play pool, or walk up his favourite mountain, or eat bacon sandwiches, sit in the sunshine? I’ll never see him again or hear his voice
Nor will I ever hug him and tell him he was one of the most significant and loved people in my life
Over the years, different emotions have crashed in and out; anger, guilt, hurt, sadness, confusion.  It’s overwhelming
But when Stan died, I suddenly saw life as extremely precious and short
I became fearless and threw myself into my photography
I’m now working full-time as a freelance photographer, have co-run a gallery and published three books
I’m living life for myself – but also for Stan
He’s always, always with me

Get email updates with the day's biggest stories Billie Charity hit rock-bottom following the tragic death of her brother Stan
Here, the 47-year-old explains how focusing on her passion for photography helped her grieve and build a new life My most precious memories of my younger brother Stan are of us as kids
He was happy, beautiful and the sweetest boy in the world.  I adored him
We’d spend hours playing Lego and Monopoly together, and remained close into adulthood
I hold these memories close now – the boy he was and the relationship we had before his mental illness took hold in his thirties
Our parents separated when we were little
My dad would travel to an off-grid cottage in a remote valley near our home in Herefordshire to spend time with us
He was a fashion photographer and I still treasure the pictures he took of those sunny days
My mum also took wonderful photos of us, capturing family Christmases and our amazing garden, which she filled with sunflowers one year
Photography was a huge passion for the whole family
When Stan and I grew up, we lived together in London
I loved working at the BBC Learning department doing PR
But Stan never seemed happy and he returned to Herefordshire to live with Mum
I took photos all the time and my now-husband Dave and I would always take our cameras out at weekends
After a few visits back to Herefordshire, Dave fell in love with the area
He got on really well with Stan, which made me happy
I was feeling broody and the countryside felt like a better option, so we moved back and lived with Mum and my brother for a couple of years
I remember that time fondly
We ate together every night and took turns to cook
We played board games and pool, watched family TV favourites
Most importantly, we talked and reminisced
Some time later, unbeknown to any of us, my brother developed a serious mental illness
I’d had my first daughter and was suffering postnatal depression
Mum was also diagnosed with MS – things were pretty heavy
Me and Stan grew apart
I had another daughter shortly afterwards
I know Stan loved them both but I couldn’t understand why he appeared to have little interest in them and I resented this
He once told them they could have his old car as a play den
He once played pool with them, once bounced on the trampoline with them, once invited them to watch Scooby-Doo

Matt Lloyd, 54, spent six weeks in ICU and on a burns unit at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, undergoing total of four operations following the self-harming incident last August A dad suffered 70% full body burns as a result of self-harming
Matt Lloyd had suffered a breakdown in a 12-year relationship at the time of the incident - and has thanked hospital staff for saving his life
The 54-year-old was rushed to Glasgow Royal Infirmary last August before spending six weeks in intensive care and then being transferred to the burns unit
He underwent a total of four operations, reports the Daily Record
The first thing he remembers on waking up was asking to speak to his two sons, and admits he feels guilty about what he put them through
Speaking about the heroic medical staff who treated him, Matt said: I really believe that without their help, I wouldn’t be here
They saved me and gave me back to my sons
With 60-70 per cent full-body burns, doctors operated quickly to save Matt’s life and prevent further damage to his muscles
He told his sons and the rest of the family he was in a desperate place prior to the incident
He said: I felt so guilty about what I had put them (his sons) through and explained to them and my family that I didn’t do it because I didn’t love them
I just didn’t love myself at that time
During his time on the burns unit Matt was looked after by physiotherapists, occupational therapists and healthcare support workers, as well as mental health teams who address the impacts of the trauma

Catriona Murray, a senior physiotherapist on the unit, said: A burn injury is often a life-changing injury, not just for the patient, but for their family too
We come together as a team, to help encourage functional tasks, our goal is to help get people back to functioning as they were before their injury
Thanking the nursing team, Matt said: I really believe that without their help, I wouldn’t be here

Savvy teen Sam Badger, 17, who made a staggering £20,000 selling personalised phone cases from his bedroom in Tamworth, Staffordshire, was bullied in primary school and told he wouldn't amount to anything A teen entrepreneur with autism who was told he'd never succeed has made a staggering £20,000 by selling phone cases from the bedroom of his family home
Sam Badger, 17, from Tamworth in Staffordshire, launched OnTheCase4U just 18 months and has shifted over 4,000 personalised cases since
The savvy teen has even opened a vending machine stocked with his products in Birmingham's Bullring shopping centre, Birmingham Live reports
Sam's designs have taken the internet by storm - and he's drummed up nearly 600,000 followers on TikTok with his popular videos - that have been watched nearly 20 million times
The 17-year-old spotted a gap in the market after trying to find a phone case online for himself
He then set up OnTheCase4U - offering high-quality, customisable phone cases
Working with his mum, Sam transfers unique designs onto blank cases using a printing press before shipping them off to customers
After being bullied at primary school and told he’d never amount to anything, Sam - who was diagnosed with and ADHD aged seven - said he wanted to ‘inspire’ children with learning difficulties
At primary school I was bullied quite a bit and the teachers didn’t have a clue about my autism , Sam said
I want to help raise a bit of awareness and show parents of autistic children that their kids are capable of achieving great things
I had a hard start at most schools with a lot of naughty behaviour, but I always knew I was capable of things
People were telling me I wasn’t going to ever succeed or that I had no potential, but I used that as extra motivation
And now I’ve turned things around and put the same energy I used to put into being naughty into my business, and I’m determined to make it work
Sam, who attends a specialist sixth form college, has never studied business but has come up with a ‘unique’ approach to selling his cases using vending machines
In only a few weeks, he has already made nearly £300 from his spot in the Bullring and plans to open more machines in Manchester’s Arndale shopping centre and Piccadilly train station
When you’re looking for a case, you want it there and then, the teenager said
You don’t want to have to wait for postage
So I thought, why not bring it to the comfort of people’s own shopping centres so they can get it there and then? It’s just so much more convenient
Over the past 18 months, Sam’s business has been doing a roaring trade - but the teen says empowering people with learning difficulties is ‘far more important’ to him than making a profit
There’s a lot of unfilled potential in the autistic community, he said
A lot of parents of children with autism and ADHD say their kids aren't being encouraged enough to succeed
And I've had autistic people on TikTok message me saying they’ve been forced to give up hobbies and not follow their passions
I hope my story inspires them not to give up - no matter what anyone says

Rory Wood's family said he lost his battle with his brain in a heartbreaking tribute, with the University of Manchester addressing upsetting reports about his death A student has been found dead after posting a series of troubling tweets about being unable to afford university
The family of Rory Wood, from Hereford, say he had lost his battle with his brain and hoped that increased awareness of mental illness would be his legacy
His cause of death has not been announced, but a pal claimed in a viral tweet that Rory had taken his own life because of the hopelessness of his situation
Rory, 27, who was a podcaster, gave the University of Manchester a £1000 deposit for a Masters degree but then was unable to afford living expenses
Police said he was first reported missing just after 2am on Monday having failed to return home from work and he died the following day
One of his final tweets said: I lost one grand in a deposit to a university because, while I met the offer requirements, it became clear that I hadn't made nearly enough money to fund the living costs after two years saving in full time work
There were no university fees in this country until 1998 btw
He added on his @thekafkadude account: Everything just feels impossible and unliveable
Rory's friend Phoca Vitulina alleged the university had rejected his application - but the University of Manchester has denied this
She tweeted: So Manchester University took an applicants £1k, rejected their application because they can’t make living costs, and didn’t give the money back
This applicant, a friend, then dies by suicide because of his absolute hopelessness of his situation.  It’s absolutely scandalous
The University of Manchester said records showed the prospective student's application 'is still open' and was 'not rejected by the University'
They added in a statement that they could not find any record suggesting any request for a refund
Rory's family have since shared their heartbreak over his death in a tribute shared on Twitter
They said: Thank you for all your love for our beautiful son, brother, nephew and cousin, Rory
We are completely humbled and overwhelmed by the messages of support on Twitter
We realise that there are people on here that truly loved him and the fact that he made your days just a little bit brighter brings a smile to our faces in these tragic times
Rory may not have mentioned it on here but he has always had loving and supportive friends and family that tried everything to help him but his battle with his brain sadly overcame him
We ask that Rory's legacy is the increased awareness of mental illness - please all look after yourselves and always remember to speak out
Rory completing his bachelors degree in politics, philosophy and economics last week was one of the proudest moments of our lives
We will never stop loving you Rory x

We can confirm that a place was successfully secured for a Master's at the University
According to our records this application is still open and wasn't withdrawn by the applicant and has not been rejected by the University
From our initial enquiries, we can find no record or email correspondence suggesting any request for a refund or further request for help
West Mercia Police are investigating the circumstances surrounding Rory's death and an inquest is expected to take place
A spokesperson said: Rory Wood was first reported missing just after 2am on Monday 25 July having failed to return home from work
Sadly, on Tuesday 26 July, it was confirmed that Rory had passed away
There is not believed to be any third party involvement, and his next of kin have been informed
A report will now be prepared for the coroner

Landon 'Waldy' Raber was found dead in a small pond on the property where he went missing hours earlier in Curdsville, Virginia, said the local sheriff's department A six-year-old boy with non-verbal autism and Down Syndrome has been found dead in a pond hours after he went missing
Landon 'Waldy' Raber was reported missing at 8
45pm on Sunday after wandering from his home in Curdsville, Virginia, said the local sheriff's department
Emergency services including state police, county deputies and volunteer fire services assisted in an overnight search for the boy.  At around 5
30am the following day, his body was found in a small pond on the property where he went missing
In a statement to CBS News, Sheriff William G.  Kidd Jr
said: This is a very tragic and unfortunate incident
We as a community grieve this loss
I do want to personally thank all who participated in the search efforts to include the fire departments and the many local residents who came to lend a hand
I want to express my sincere thanks to each and every one of you
I, as well as the community, extend our thoughts and prayers to the family for their loss
The Toga Volunteer Fire Department shared a link to a community prayer gathering being held in Landon's memory
In a tribute, Buckingham County Primary School wrote: Landon was a beautiful representation of what is good and wholesome and right in this world
Although our hearts are broken, we are thankful for the memories and moments shared with Landon
They will be cherished forever as he was dearly loved by our school family
Buckingham Primary School extends our deepest sympathy, prayers, and love to his family and all who were so blessed to know him
The cause of Landon's death has not yet been determined
Nearly half of children with autism go missing from their environments, shows data published by the American Academy of Pediatrics
Of the 49% surveyed whose autistic child had attempted to run away, 24% said they were in danger of drowning The National Centre of Missing & Exploited Children says: Children on the autism spectrum may seek out small or enclosed spaces, head toward water or places of special interest to them
It adds they also may try to escape overwhelming stimuli such as sights, sounds, surroundings, or activities of others

The American retail chain announced plans to close 150 stores out of its roughly 900, and sack 20 per cent of staff just two days before Gustavo Arnal's death in New York City A high-powered chief executive plunged to his death from the 18th floor of a famous tower after his company recorded record losses
Gustavo Arnal, Chief Financial Officer of Bed Bath & Beyond, took his life from the 18th floor of the famous 'Jenga' tower in lower Manhattan's Tribeca neighbourhood, New York City, on Friday
The American retail chain had been hugely struggling following the aftershocks of Covid-19 with high inflation and a sinking economy
The company announced plans to close 150 stores, of its roughly 900, and sack 20 percent of staff just two days before Mr Arnal's death
The announcement cause the business to lose nearly a quarter of its on Wednesday
He reportedly sold over 42,000 shares in the company for $1million just over two weeks ago, according to MarketBeat. com
But at the time of his death he still owned around $6. 5million in shares
Mr Arnal had only been with the company for two years and previously held the same role at British cosmetics giant Avon and had a 20-year career working overseas leading Procter & Gamble
Emergency service calls regarding someone jumping at 56 Leonard Street were recorded at around 12:30pm according to a spokeswoman for the New York Police Department
Beth, Bath & Beyond said it had secured $500 million in new financing but shares continued to plunge and fell as much as 25 percent in one mornings trading
When Mr Arnal joined Bed, Bath & Beyond in April 2020 a company spokesman said in a statement they were bringing in world class talent to offer new perspectives, expertise and experience as we rebuild our business
Gustavo exemplifies this and his experience delivering business transformation at other leading companies, his deep knowledge of the retail and consumer goods space, as well as his energy and drive will help accelerate our transformation plans
He held an undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Universidad Simon Bolivar in Colombia, and a master’s degree in Finance from the Universidad Metropolitana in Venezuela.
National Association of State Emergency Medical Services Officials were seen carrying the man's body in a black body bag
The building has 57 floors and is 243 metres high

Sarah McGill, from Derry in northern Ireland, said her concerns started when her six-year-old girl Niamh, didn't want to interact with others from an early age A mum-of-two has described how she spotted signs that her daughter was autistic at just six months old
Sarah McGill said her concerns began when daughter Niamh, six, didn't want to interact from an early age
She said signs that Niamh had Autism Spectrum Disorder emerged when she was just six months old, but she wasn't formally diagnosed until the age of three, MyDerry reports
Her local GP turned Sarah away, ruling out the possibility of autism on several occasions, Ms McGill said
She said: At six months we started to notice that my daughter didn’t like to be around anyone except myself and my husband, she was constantly crying
At that time we thought it was colic as the GP had ruled out everything else
Although in hindsight I can recognise that it was sensory overload
Her environments were too overstimulating for her and her crying was the only communication tool she had at that time
Niamh hit all her infant milestones late and some not at all
She began flapping hands, lining her toys up and her communication began to regress, she stopped babbling and vocalising
She was so content in her own little bubble
All this carried on for another year, with little to no change in her development
We saw a paediatrician at 18 months, and she said Niamh presents with autism
That was the beginning of our journey
I found I had to learn to think quickly on my feet and develop strategies to make life easier for my daughter
Last year, Sarah began to blog Niamh's journey, through AutisticAlly, which now has over 3,000 followers online
The Derry mum said it's only since setting up the blog that she realised how other families across Northern Ireland were struggling to cope
However, she said there was no need for families to fear the word autism
She said: Autism is not a word to be feared, it is a person to be accepted and loved
It is a word that explains why people behave and think differently
If you have questions about autism, ask an autistic person
The more we talk about autism, the more widely recognised it will become
Yes, autistic people share the same core similarities but how an autistic person experiences the world around them is completely unique to them
What is happening where you live? Find out by adding your postcode
Understanding each person as an individual is key and realising what works for one person may not work for another
Meanwhile, Sarah also revealed recently that she too had been diagnosed with the disorder, saying it had left her feeling numb
It took me a while to process the information and what it meant, Sarah added
I’m still the same person I was before my diagnosis but it has brought clarity to my life
It is an explanation of why I behave the way I do and why I see and feel things differently from other people
It is a life-affirming experience that is teaching me to be kinder to myself
People often say, at my age why would I want to label myself as autistic, but what they don’t know is that I was already labelling myself as a failure, anxious, confused, not good enough, weird, and faking my way through life
I always felt like an outsider, looking into a world that wasn’t built for me
Not understanding why people behave the way they do and why people don’t say what they mean
I was a people pleaser that was riddled with anxiety and depression but still had a smile on my face because I wanted to ‘fit in’, I wanted people to like me
I now have this positive label
This is an explanation that answers my questions about how I’ve experienced my life
It fits, I fit here
She said it's paramount that more awareness is spread about autism inclusion and acceptance
The more we talk about autism, the more widely recognised it will become in our society, she said
Unless you have a child like my Niamh, who was luckily diagnosed so early in life
Many parents out there are fighting for their children to be heard, the only way that autistic people are going to be diagnosed quicker is for autism training to be made mandatory in all schools
With specific training on how women on the spectrum present differently to many boys
So many girls, like myself are being overlooked because they are quiet and don’t make a fuss
I want these girls to know that they aren’t alone

French financier Charles-Henry Kurzen jumped to his death from a luxury apartment he was viewing in a high rise New York block while he was being shown around by a real estate agent A French financier jumped from a luxury New York apartment in a high rise block after asking where the balcony was while he was being shown around by an estate agent
The 43-year-old man, identified as Charles-Henry Kurzen, fell from the 32nd-floor balcony at 100 United Nations Plaza which is in the Turtle Bay neighbourhood of Manhatten
He threw himself off the building at 1
15pm local time and landed on a third-floor patio, a police spokesman said
The financial banker, who was living in Brooklyn, had been taking a look at the apartment with a real estate agent when he then suddenly jumped, according to a source
Mr Kurzen was pronounced dead at the scene
A coworker didn't comment except to say that Mr Kurzen was a dear friend, reported the New York Post
He was a financier who graduated from the Ecole Superieure de Commerce de Paris (ESCP) Business School and was a partner at Saltbox Partners LLC
The company’s biography of him on its website showed that he had a long career working in French and US finance
Other roles that he has had includes an analyst in the the Mergers and Acquisitions Group at Lazard Freres & Co.  in Paris
Saltbox Partners website stated: Charles-Henry has been with Saltbox since the beginning
He has over 14 years of experience in the banking sector and has worked with Nina since moving to New York to start his project finance career at Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank where he was involved in the origination, structuring and execution of 15 financings of over $5 billion

Charles-Henry is a true practitioner who enjoys all the intricacies of non-recourse financings, and the challenges of bringing new deal profiles and sponsors to market
His experience has spanned financing coal mining development to the introduction of renewable power in South Africa
In conjunction with Saltbox’s work on Phase 1 of this landmark program, Charles-Henry wrote an article about this long awaited initiative by the South African government
He is a graduate of Ecole Superieure de Commerce de Paris (ESCP) Business School
The block of flat is close to the United Nations building in New York and a two-bedroom, two-and-a-half bathroom apartment on the 32nd floor is advertised for sale for $2. 9 million (£2. 29 million)

Edward Lake's three children, as well as their grandfather, were killed in a crash in September 2015 by a drunk driver who was then granted full parole last year A dad-of-three whose kids were killed in a horror car crash took his own life after Father's Day so they can all play together forever
Edward Lake, from Ontario, US, was found dead on Monday, the day after Father's Day
On Sunday, Edward’s wife Jennifer Neville-Lake shared a moving photo on social media showing their children’s grave

A heartbroken family have paid tribute to a 'strong' mother who was tragically found dead by her partner as he returned home from taking their daughter out for food A devastated family have paid tribute to a 'strong' mum who left them shocked after she sadly took her own life
Coroners heard this week how Indre Razutyte, 31, was discovered at her Pontefract home by partner Nathan Price along with police after he returned with their young daughter from a meal
The mother and transport manager was declared dead at the scene by paramedics shortly after, reports YorkshireLive
Her death on March 22 was ruled as a suicide at Wakefield Coroner's Court on Tuesday (July 26)
A statement from Nathan to the coroner confirmed that he and Lithuania-born Indre had split up in the days before the tragic incident, and had since begun discussing how to co-parent their daughter
He recalled having been to Indra's house earlier on the day to take the child out for food, but had received no reply when he texted her on the way back
Discovering the house empty with the lights off upon reaching the house, he took his daughter inside through an unlocked conservatory at the back before noticing written notes on the kitchen worktop
I saw notes on the kitchen counter when I walked in
I was concerned on reading them - I was worried and called the police, he said
Police officers arrived at 7
02pm and the three searched for Indre
PC Barraclough was the first to spot her through the glass doors that led to the garage and an ambulance was called
Nathan and PC Barraclough managed to break the window that led to the garage, where they found Indre
CPR was attempted but paramedics tragically pronounced her dead at 7. 33pm
Indre's mother said a written statement read by Assistant Coroner John Hobson that Indra's death had come as a complete shock, with her strong daughter having made plans to return planning to visit her back home in Lithuania only days before
Recalling their text conversations in the days before her passing, she said: The conversations were quite normal with nothing that caused any worries
It's very difficult for me to believe and understand
Indre was a very strong person and never displayed any signs that would have caused her to take her own life
I last visited her and Nathan in October 2021 - they both did appear different and like they may go their separate ways
I believed they were trying to reconcile
Mr Hobson concluded he was satisfied that Indre's cause of death was suicide
Addressing her mother, he said: I offer my condolences to you and thank you for your endeavours in coming to the country to be here for your daughter today
My condolences to Indre's daughter as well and also to Mr Price

Richard Jeavons, 37, was found dead in the living room of his home in Chelmsley Wood, West Midlands - police tried to save his life, but CPR efforts failed to revive him A dad-of-four tragically took his own life after a series of mental health struggles and drug misuse, an inquest heard
Richard Jeavons, 37, was found dead in the living room of his home in Chelmsley Wood, West Midlands, on December 2
He had penned heartfelt notes to his boys and parents before his death
Police tried to save his life, but CPR efforts failed to revive him, Birmingham Live reports
Richard, a Birmingham-born electrician, was struggling after sad news he would no longer be able to see his children after a dangerous driving conviction
He was given the news as he was handed a two-year community order for theft, attempted theft, assault and dangerous driving in September last year
He was told he could not have contact until his sons turned 18, banned from driving for 18 months and ordered to pay £200 compensation alongside a £100 fine
Assistant Coroner Rebecca Ollivere recorded a verdict of suicide as the inquest concluded at Birmingham Coroner's Court on Tuesday, April 19
The inquest heard how he was suffering from emotionally unstable personality disorder, substance misuse, ADHD and drug-related psychotic symptoms
When he was first referred to the early intervention service at Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Trust in 2018, he had been motivated to engage
Miss Ollivere told the court: He struggled with his mental health and substance misuse
He also had a history of various suicide attempts over the years and he had ADHD
Richard was referred to the early intervention service, and he remained with them for three years
It became apparent during this time that his psychosis was not related to a specific mental health condition, but was due to his misuse of drugs
He was discharged into the community and allocated a care coordinator
But over the summer of 2021, he became very unstable and he was added to the waiting list for a hospital bed
While awaiting a bed, his mental state improved and after further review, it was decided it was no longer required, the assistant coroner continued
In September, he received upsetting news that he was no longer going to be able to have contact with his children
However, by November, his mental state had improved somewhat and he was engaging with services
Losing contact with his children led to Richard increasing his substance misuse and suffering from low moods
However, he was trying to engage with the services by attending cycling groups and narcotics anonymous
He managed to reduce his substance misuse and on December 1, he called his care coordinator, Geraldine Avis, to discuss his future
Richard was even humorous as he spoke of plans to go into town and get a job, get fit for the summer, buy a car and obtain a bus pass, she told the inquest
He gave no indication that he would harm himself, the court heard
But within hours, police officers were called to his Birmingham home - where he was sadly found dead alongside two suicide notes for his children and parents
The assistant coroner added: Later that night, officers were called to Richard's address after reports of a male with a knife
Sadly when officers gained entry to the property, they found him in his living room and despite CPR being attempted, sadly he could not be revived
No care or service delivery problems or missed opportunities were found in his care, a root cause analysis concluded

Five Acre Wood, a special school in Maidstone, Kent, has admitted to breaking its own policies and government guidelines by repeatedly strapping two autistic twins, Samuel and Jacob Montague, into chairs to restrict their movement A school that repeatedly strapped two autistic students into chairs to restrict their movement has apologised after a court ruled it breached their human rights
Five Acre Wood, a school for children with special education needs, has admitted breaking its own policy and government guidance by using mechanical restraints on twins Samuel and Jacob Montague
The twins, who are both severely autistic and non-verbal, started at the school in 2009 aged four, with the intention of attending until age 19
They are now both 17
But their parents Annie and Mark pulled them out in 2013 after realising staff were strapping the boys into chairs despite objections and protests
Kent County Council, which runs the school in Maidstone, has offered their parents more than £80,000 compensation after a civil court case
Now Annie and Mark are calling for changes to the law to make it clearer the restraints should not be used against children like Samuel and Jacob
In a statement issued after the settlement, they said: Children with special educational needs should be protected, not strapped into chairs
It has been a long, difficult process, but it has been our privilege to be the voice for Samuel and Jacob
They, and other children with autism or learning disabilities, deserve the full protection of the law
Local authorities should be on their side, empowering their lives, instead of using restrictive practices like restraints that can cause trauma and harm
Now that the case is over, and Samuel and Jacob are safe and thriving, we look forward to campaigning to stop the use of restraints against children with special educational needs
The first public incident took place in 2010, when the boys were wheeled out at a school concert strapped into the 'Hardrock' chairs
The chairs restrain movement through a number of straps that go around legs, arms, and shoulders
When their parents protested, they were told the mechanical restraint chairs were the only way the boys could participate in the concert and their use was a one-off
Despite this, the couple became concerned that Samuel and Jacob were being routinely restrained while at the school
And in June 2011, a clinical psychologist visited and witnessed one of the boys strapped into the Hardrock chairs in the classroom
On one occasion the boys' mother and their carer attended a school sports day where other children were outside and running around
But Jacob was strapped into the chair and visibly distressed
The boys' autism means they interpret the world through touch and movement, so the use of the chairs completely undermined their human rights, Annie and Mark argued
After they took Samuel and Jacob out of the school, they home-schooled them and the boys have since flourished
The couple brought a civil case under the Human Rights Act against the council
They argued the restraints had been used unlawfully as the school failed to consider less restrictive options and failed to put in place a plan to reduce the use of restraints
The school admitted a raft of failings and admitted the use of straps and trays on the specialist chairs could restrict movement and amount to mechanical restraint
They admitted the restraint took place while the boys were at school and without their parents' agreement, which was a breach of the school's policy and national guidance
Annie and Mark added: We only sought legal redress after many years trying to get answers from Kent County Council
This case was never about financial compensation; it was about trying to stop these practices happening to other children up and down the country
What is happening where you live? Find out by adding your postcode
Solicitor Catriona Rubens, who represented the Montague family, said: Samuel and Jacob were active, sensory seeking children who, because of their autism, interpret the world through movement and touch
It is our view that, by strapping them into mechanical restraint chairs at school, the local authority breached their human rights and failed to deliver any therapeutic benefit to the twins
We welcome Kent County Council's sincere apology and recognition that it failed Samuel and Jacob in this case
The success of Samuel and Jacob's case is a testament to the many years their parents spent fighting to get answers from the local authority about the use of restraint against their sons
A spokesman for the council said in a statement that it sincerely apologises for any harm, distress and/or pain and suffering that were caused to Samuel and Jacob and to their parents as a result of these failures

Daryl McWilliam, 24, was found dead in his hotel room after drunkenly texting his girlfriend of 12 months that he didn't want to 'be with her anymore' An amazing 24-year-old dad took his own life after splitting up with his girlfriend during a weekend away in Blackpool
An inquest heard Daryl McWilliam had travelled to the seaside resort with his girlfriend of 12 months, Natalie Jones
The couple, from Kilmarnock, Scotland, visited Wetherspoons for something to eat before returning to their room at Garvey's Promenade Hotel on Saturday February 26
The pair then decided to go back out and visit three pubs in Blackpool town centre, Lancs Live reports
Towards the end of the night, it is reported that Daryl, 24, became increasingly intoxicated and, after becoming separated from Natalie, he sent her a text saying: I don't want to be with you anymore
Shocked at this, Natalie then made several attempts to contact Daryl who eventually returned to the hotel at around midnight
The couple had an argument, during which Daryl damaged Natalie's phone and other belongings in the room, before she started to pack her things into their car
When Natalie went back to the room, Daryl wasn't there, and so she went downstairs to the bar to look for him
A short while later Natalie went back up to the room where she found Daryl unconscious
Paramedics and police were called but despite extensive resuscitation efforts Daryl was pronounced dead at 1. 37am on February 27
The cause of death was given as hanging
An inquest at Blackpool Town Hall today (Tuesday July 19) heard that Daryl, a pipe-fitter at Kilmaurs engineering firm A&L Mechanical Installations, had no history of mental health issues
He had visited the GP with his mum in 2020 for help with low mood but he was not known to the community mental health team
The content of the messages sent by Daryl indicate he was intoxicated
This tragic incident would appear to have stemmed from the breakdown of the relationship on a night which involved alcohol consumption
Assistant Coroner Louise Rae returned a conclusion of suicide
She said: Daryl McWilliam was on holiday in Blackpool with his partner
Following an argument she returned to the room to find him hanging
He was not known to mental health services
I agree this was a tragic incident which stemmed from the breakdown of a relationship
In terms of the evidence. .
I don't believe anybody could have acted sooner
It is difficult to find any conclusion other than suicide. .
I am therefore satisfied that the only conclusion possible and the one that I reach is the short-form conclusion of suicide
A fundraiser launched after Daryl's death, to help his parents Heather and John pay for the funeral, raised more than £2,200
Daryl's girlfriend Natalie paid tribute to him after his death, as reported by the Daily Record, in which she described him as the most amazing person she had ever known
She added: You showed me what true love actually is
I will always love you Daryl
I really wish I had gotten more time with you and got to do everything we planned on
You never failed to make me smile whenever I felt down and I can’t thank you enough for how happy you made me

Josh Hunt had just finished work when he decided to buy snacks and visit Westleigh Park in Leigh on December 21 A mum whose vulnerable son had bleach sprayed in his face by a gang of thugs says he could have been blinded in the attack
Josh Hunt had just finished work when he decided to buy snacks and visit Westleigh Park in Leigh on December 21
The 19-year-old, who has autism and Tourette's syndrome, had not long sat down when four men approached him at around 7pm
They asked Josh for his name before telling him: This is a robbery
After a few moments, the group decided to walk away empty handed, the MEN reports
But they were back minutes later demanding his phone and wallet
Suddenly, Josh was dragged to the ground
The gang began punching and kicking him as he lay on the floor
As he jumped up in a bid to save his £539 electric scooter – which he had purchased the the week previous – Josh had a substance sprayed in his eyes
The chemical was later discovered to be bleach – leaving him unable to see
The group fled with his scooter just as Josh’s friend arrived to meet him
Josh’s parents were informed who immediately rushed to the park
On arrival, they found their son screaming in pain
His eyes were very inflamed and swollen; he couldn’t see at all, his mother Kelly Hunt said
My husband ran to the nearest shop and asked for bottles of water which he kept washing his eyes with
He then put him in the car and as he was driving home from the park, which is five minutes from our house, my son was screaming saying, ‘Ouch, dad, my eyes are burning so much, I can’t see’
On arrival at home, the family called the police
Officers arranged for a fast-response paramedic to visit them
After assessing Josh’s condition, his parents were advised to take him straight to hospital
The teen was escorted by detectives to Royal Albert Edward Infirmary in Wigan

Josh had his eyes washed numerous times before being discharged with a prescription ointment
His clothing was taken by Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue service to assess the chemical thrown at him
It was found to be bleach
One of the lads said to my son, ‘I’ve got ammo and I’ll spray you up’, Kelly, 39, continued
I’m mortified by it; I feel sick to know how hard he worked to buy himself the scooter
I’m in pins whenever he goes anywhere now as well as my other sons
I still feel shaken by it all, all I could do was pray his eyesight wasn't going to be lost
There have not yet been any arrests and the investigation is still ongoing, a spokesman for GMP confirmed
Detective Inspector Patrick Wood, of GMP Wigan CID, said: This was an awful attack on a vulnerable man with Asperger's
The attack has left him incredibly shaken and I would strongly appeal for anyone with information about this incident - including who the offenders may be or the location of the Xiaomai Electric Scooter - to please contact police as soon as possible
This kind of attack is both cowardly and unacceptable and we will be working at pace to find the individuals responsible
Anyone with information - including CCTV or dashcam footage from around the park at the time of the incident - can report it online or by using the LiveChat service at www. gmp. police

His clothing was taken by Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue service to assess the chemical thrown at him
It was found to be bleach
One of the lads said to my son, ‘I’ve got ammo and I’ll spray you up’, Kelly, 39, continued
I’m mortified by it; I feel sick to know how hard he worked to buy himself the scooter
I’m in pins whenever he goes anywhere now as well as my other sons
I still feel shaken by it all, all I could do was pray his eyesight wasn't going to be lost
There have not yet been any arrests and the investigation is still ongoing, a spokesman for GMP confirmed
Detective Inspector Patrick Wood, of GMP Wigan CID, said: This was an awful attack on a vulnerable man with Asperger's
The attack has left him incredibly shaken and I would strongly appeal for anyone with information about this incident - including who the offenders may be or the location of the Xiaomai Electric Scooter - to please contact police as soon as possible
This kind of attack is both cowardly and unacceptable and we will be working at pace to find the individuals responsible

Why he ended up in the Devon seafront hotel where Agatha Christie spent her wedding night and why he apparently ended his life there has never been established A chilling death that was compared to an Agatha Christie novel remains unsolved twenty-five years later
The man was found dead in a seafront hotel room in Torquay, Devon - the same town where the thriller writer was born
Mr Patel was found dead at the Grand Hotel and, next to his naked body, there was a glass of Coke which contained the poison cyanide
It turned out the room had been booked under a false name, with Mr Patel giving a fake home address in London
Mr Patel checked into the landmark hotel in September 1997 after having stayed for three days in the modest Lee's Hotel and Cantonese Restaurant, reports DevonLive
The mystery guest, in his mid-thirties, ordered room service and ate a meal of roast lamb, washed down with a glass of Frascati, an Italian white wine
His body was found by a chambermaid the next day, on the 24
His black suit, white shirt and multi-coloured tie were neatly folded on his bed, and on the bedside table was £94
12 in cash and an empty wine glass
But when the authorities were called in and tried to identify him, the lines of inquiry carried out the investigators found a series of dead ends
It was only due to a coincidence that a tantalising clue emerged
Two marks were seen on his shoulder, a sign that he was a member of the Tamil Tigers, a rebel group in Sri Lanka, an island state in the Indian Ocean
But why he ended up in the Devon seafront hotel where Agatha Christie spent her wedding night, and why he apparently ended his life there, has never been established

When the body was removed to the mortuary, coroner’s officer Robin Little spotted the marks on Mr Patel’s shoulder
The then South Devon coroner Hamish Turner later recalled: We spent a year trying to find out who this chap was
We even photographed his face and sent that photo around the country hoping someone would recognise him, but had no luck
It was perhaps a grim thing to do – but we had nothing else to go on because he carried nothing to identify himself
It was a lucky coincidence that the local forensic pathologist, Dr Guyan Fernando, is from Sri Lanka
He was told of these marks in a chance conversation with Mr Little and was able to tell us that the dead man must be from his country because these marks were the tribal sign of the Tamil Tigers, a rebel group in Sri Lanka

The cyanide was another clue that the dead man was a Tamil Tiger because, Mr Fernando said, they always carried a cyanide pill with them in case they were caught
Then there was a courteous note, penned by Mr Patel
It read: I am very sorry for what I have done here but this is the place I had to carry out the deed
To the chef, the food was magnificent – fit for the gods – for a final meal.  Thank you
Mr Turner said: I could only remark at the inquest that his reference to this place might be because he had read some Agatha Christie story and knew of her connection with the Grand Hotel
The dead man’s clothing was examined for clues to his identity but there were no laundry tags or marks that might help
He had a rather nice Parker pen which might have suggested he was an educated man, Mr Turner added, but despite months of investigation by the police we never discovered his real name or what he was doing in Torquay
It was, he added, the most baffling case of his career, and he could only now surmise that the dead man must have been running away from someone he feared, which was why he chose to end his life when he did
As to exactly why he died, and whether he was a devotee of Agatha Christie, I suppose we will never know

Nathan Hunt's dad Derek says new evidence found his son - who served with Prince Harry - was deeply traumatised by a Taliban attack that killed and seriously wounded 10 Afghan soldiers The family of a war hero who served alongside Prince Harry claim new evidence shows that their son’s suicide was linked to combat service
Warrant Officer Nathan Hunt’s parents are campaigning to have his name added to the memorial at the National Arboretum in Staffordshire
So far defence chiefs have refused to budge on their ruling that his death was not linked to his service in Afghanistan 10 years before
Now the family have discovered he was deeply traumatised by a Taliban rocket attack which killed and seriously wounded up to 10 Afghan soldiers
The carnage happened in December 2007 during the ferocious battle for the town of Musa Qala in Helmand
The report states that Nathan and another soldier tried and failed to save the lives of Afghan soldiers
Nathan’s dad Derek, himself an Army veteran, said: I received this report last week and it shows beyond doubt that Nathan was seriously traumatised by the war
He had nightmares and was really struggling
He had to deal with Afghan soldiers who had been blown to pieces or who had lost limbs
Anyone who witnessed that sort of thing would be seriously affected by it
This seems to have been ignored by people who decided that Nathan should not have his name on the war memorial
Or, worse still, they had no idea this happened to Nathan
Nathan was found hanged at his home in Lincoln aged 39 on January 2, 2018, after developing PTSD
He left behind a young daughter
An inquest seven months later heard he had suffered nightmares as a result of dealing with Taliban bombs
A recently acquired transcript reveals that his ex-wife Lainey was convinced he had PTSD after returning from Afghanistan in 2008
But he refused to get help because he was fearful of the impact it might have on his promotion chances
Derek added: I will be taking this up with the new Veterans’ Minister Johnny Mercer when I meet with him next month
There is now so much evidence showing that Nathan was obviously in a bad way after he returned from Afghanistan
I just can’t understand why this has all been ignored
Nathan served with Harry in Helmand in 2008 while attached to the Household Cavalry

Prince Harry wrote to the couple telling of his dismay at not being able to help after being stripped of his military titles

Ms Nevill and the family had not realised until they were back home in Norfolk that they had left their nine-year-old daughter Summer's teddy behind A mum is furious after a company asked her to fork out £20 for shipping - to return her autistic daughter's teddy bear
Donna Nevill, 34, went away on a family holiday to Slough to take in the sights of nearby London, using Onpoint Apartments
But the family were unhappy with the state of their accommodation so left a day early, on Friday July 1
Ms Nevill and the family had not realised until they were back home that they had left their daughter Summer's teddy behind
Summer, aged nine, is autistic and heavily reliant on the comforter, which she struggles to sleep without
However, when the family contacted the company to let them know what happened, they say that they were told they had to pay a one-off charge of £20 for it to be sent back
Onpoint Apartments has told NottinghamshireLive they make no profit from the £20 fee and as a small business they cannot absorb such a cost
Ms Nevill, from Norfolk, said: We put Summer to bed and realised we didn't have her comforter with her - she sleeps with it every night
I messaged the apartments who said they were sending the cleaners in
The cleaners found it and I was told that if I paid postage they would send it back
I told them that they should really send it back for free as a gesture of goodwill as the apartment was shocking - we complained straight away and nothing was done about it
It took me over a week of phoning them everyday asking 'what are you going to do about it?' I had an autistic, distressed child who was crying all the time because of it
They eventually sent me the invoice and it was £20
It's just a teddy bear - it does not cost that much to send it back
I am prepared to pay a fiver, maybe a tenner, but not £20
We are going abroad next week and so we need it back as my daughter needs it for the airplane
The attitude has just been 'we don't care, you're not getting it back unless you pay'.  It is absolutely shocking
She added that she would struggle to even afford to pay £20 for the return, as the family contends with the ongoing cost of living crisis
Donna and Summer had been on holiday with Summer's dad Richard Nevill, 35, along with her sister Lilly, aged six, and four-year-old brother Aarlo
In an email seen by Nottinghamshire Live, the company tells the family that it takes no responsibility for personal belongings left behind and that the returning of such items does come at a cost
They also stated that they must pay the cleaners to go to the post office to return it via post
In a statement, the company said: We are aware of this matter and would like to emphasise that we appreciate the situation and the importance of the item
We detail in our terms of conditions of stay that any items left behind after check out is solely down to the responsibility of the guest
With this particular matter, the guest contacted us to advise that she left behind her child’s teddy and needed this item back
We worked with the guest, located the teddy and offered a collection of the item, this was rejected due to the guest living too far away from the property
What is happening where you live? Find out by adding your postcode
We then offered to send the item at a total cost of £20, payable by the guest
We would like to stress that we are by no means taking any profit from this scenario
As a small business, we employ individuals that charge a call out fee; this includes packaging the item, labelling the item, travelling to and from the post office and the cost to post the item (first class, recorded delivery for tracking purposes)
Being a small business, this is not something we can absorb
We have offered solutions for this guest to ensure they receive the item, however, neither option has been accepted
We evidently would prefer this matter to be resolved and to have the item back with the owner
We hope with the above explanation, it can be appreciated why a fee of £20 has been requested as there are more costs involved than just simply posting an item
The item was left behind by the guest and this is their responsibility
As the item has a significant importance for her daughter, along with the understanding that this is the guests' error and the factors involved that determine the £20 cost, we would have hoped for a solution from the guest instead of the need to approach a newspaper
We are still awaiting the guest to accept the postage fee so as we can ship this back out to her first class, recorded delivery

A heartbroken family have paid tribute to a 'strong' mother who was tragically found dead by her partner as he returned home from taking their daughter out for food A devastated family have paid tribute to a 'strong' mum who left them shocked after she sadly took her own life
Coroners heard this week how Indre Razutyte, 31, was discovered at her Pontefract home by partner Nathan Price along with police after he returned with their young daughter from a meal
The mother and transport manager was declared dead at the scene by paramedics shortly after, reports YorkshireLive
Her death on March 22 was ruled as a suicide at Wakefield Coroner's Court on Tuesday (July 26)
A statement from Nathan to the coroner confirmed that he and Lithuania-born Indre had split up in the days before the tragic incident, and had since begun discussing how to co-parent their daughter
He recalled having been to Indra's house earlier on the day to take the child out for food, but had received no reply when he texted her on the way back
Discovering the house empty with the lights off upon reaching the house, he took his daughter inside through an unlocked conservatory at the back before noticing written notes on the kitchen worktop
I saw notes on the kitchen counter when I walked in
I was concerned on reading them - I was worried and called the police, he said
Police officers arrived at 7
02pm and the three searched for Indre
PC Barraclough was the first to spot her through the glass doors that led to the garage and an ambulance was called
Nathan and PC Barraclough managed to break the window that led to the garage, where they found Indre
CPR was attempted but paramedics tragically pronounced her dead at 7. 33pm
Indre's mother said a written statement read by Assistant Coroner John Hobson that Indra's death had come as a complete shock, with her strong daughter having made plans to return planning to visit her back home in Lithuania only days before
Recalling their text conversations in the days before her passing, she said: The conversations were quite normal with nothing that caused any worries
It's very difficult for me to believe and understand
Indre was a very strong person and never displayed any signs that would have caused her to take her own life
I last visited her and Nathan in October 2021 - they both did appear different and like they may go their separate ways
I believed they were trying to reconcile
Mr Hobson concluded he was satisfied that Indre's cause of death was suicide
Addressing her mother, he said: I offer my condolences to you and thank you for your endeavours in coming to the country to be here for your daughter today
My condolences to Indre's daughter as well and also to Mr Price

Craig Cambridge, 51, saw his life spiralling downwards after his daughter, Leah, died following a botched Brazilian butt lift in 2018 and tragically took his own life A dad took his own life after his daughter died following a botched Brazilian butt lift operation in Turkey
Craig Cambridge, 51, found his life spiralling downwards after his 29-year-old daughter Leah Cambridge died following a 2018 operation in Turkey that went wrong
The dad was tragically found dead at his home in Leeds and an inquest has found how he had never been able to get over Leah’s awful death
On the day he died, he had tried to ring doctors three times before his death but they had been closed because it was a bank holiday, Leeds Live reports
After an investigation into his death, senior coroner Kevin McLoughlin said he would be contacting the surgeon who botched Leah’s operation
Craig struggled with alcohol dependency and depression after his daughter’s tragic death, Wakefield Coroners' Court heard
On April, 5, 2021, his daughter's partner found Craig dead in his loft
This came nearly three years after Leah died in Izmir, Turkey, in August 2018
She died from a pulmonary embolism after Dr Ali Uckan accidentally injected fat into her veins
Leah had three heart attacks at the operating table
Mr McLoughlin conducted the inquests for the dad and daughter and said he wanted to let Dr Ali Uckan know the damage his surgery caused
He said to Craig's daughters Hayley and Chelsea and ex-partner Theresa Hall: Normally I am quite detached and hard-hearted about inquests, but when I saw another tragedy had befallen your family, I felt quite grievous
Having conducted the inquest into Leah all those years ago, I was incensed that the surgeon in Turkey stood well clear
I am proposing to send the report to the surgeon to make him aware of the tentacles of this
I am intending to send it to the medical authorities in Turkey to make them aware of how a tragedy manifests itself years later
I feel dreadfully sorry for you as a family
Chelsea and her partner had gone to see him on April 5, 2021, but when they were unable to get in, Chelsea’s partner ended up climbing through a window

It was then he found the body of the former personal trainer and called paramedics
Craig was tragically pronounced dead at 7:50pm that evening
He had left notes for both his daughters
Craig had a history of depression and anxiety that became much worse after Leah’s death
He had been on medication and turned to alcohol and was under the care of a community mental health team
Police also found that the morning he took his own life he had tried to call doctors three times, but they were closed because it was a bank holiday
Dr Uckan did speak at Leah's inquest, where he called the operation a guessing game, speaking to Leah's widower Scott
Mr McLoughlin branded the surgeon a coward back in 2019 for not answering her family's questions
The coroner said that he had written to the doctor eight times since to ask him to give evidence at Craig's inquest - but got no response
As he returned a verdict of suicide today, Mr McLoughlin said: I am reliant upon on the pathologist for the cause of death, which in this case is hanging
This was a suicide attributed in part to the death of his daughter who died in surgery in Turkey

Josh Hunt had just finished work when he decided to buy snacks and visit Westleigh Park in Leigh on December 21 A mum whose vulnerable son had bleach sprayed in his face by a gang of thugs says he could have been blinded in the attack
Josh Hunt had just finished work when he decided to buy snacks and visit Westleigh Park in Leigh on December 21
The 19-year-old, who has autism and Tourette's syndrome, had not long sat down when four men approached him at around 7pm
They asked Josh for his name before telling him: This is a robbery
After a few moments, the group decided to walk away empty handed, the MEN reports
But they were back minutes later demanding his phone and wallet
Suddenly, Josh was dragged to the ground
The gang began punching and kicking him as he lay on the floor
As he jumped up in a bid to save his £539 electric scooter – which he had purchased the the week previous – Josh had a substance sprayed in his eyes
The chemical was later discovered to be bleach – leaving him unable to see
The group fled with his scooter just as Josh’s friend arrived to meet him
Josh’s parents were informed who immediately rushed to the park
On arrival, they found their son screaming in pain
His eyes were very inflamed and swollen; he couldn’t see at all, his mother Kelly Hunt said
My husband ran to the nearest shop and asked for bottles of water which he kept washing his eyes with
He then put him in the car and as he was driving home from the park, which is five minutes from our house, my son was screaming saying, ‘Ouch, dad, my eyes are burning so much, I can’t see’
On arrival at home, the family called the police
Officers arranged for a fast-response paramedic to visit them
After assessing Josh’s condition, his parents were advised to take him straight to hospital
The teen was escorted by detectives to Royal Albert Edward Infirmary in Wigan

Josh had his eyes washed numerous times before being discharged with a prescription ointment
His clothing was taken by Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue service to assess the chemical thrown at him
It was found to be bleach
One of the lads said to my son, ‘I’ve got ammo and I’ll spray you up’, Kelly, 39, continued
I’m mortified by it; I feel sick to know how hard he worked to buy himself the scooter
I’m in pins whenever he goes anywhere now as well as my other sons
I still feel shaken by it all, all I could do was pray his eyesight wasn't going to be lost
There have not yet been any arrests and the investigation is still ongoing, a spokesman for GMP confirmed
Detective Inspector Patrick Wood, of GMP Wigan CID, said: This was an awful attack on a vulnerable man with Asperger's
The attack has left him incredibly shaken and I would strongly appeal for anyone with information about this incident - including who the offenders may be or the location of the Xiaomai Electric Scooter - to please contact police as soon as possible
This kind of attack is both cowardly and unacceptable and we will be working at pace to find the individuals responsible

Richard Jeavons, 37, was found dead in the living room of his home in Chelmsley Wood, West Midlands - police tried to save his life, but CPR efforts failed to revive him A dad-of-four tragically took his own life after a series of mental health struggles and drug misuse, an inquest heard
Richard Jeavons, 37, was found dead in the living room of his home in Chelmsley Wood, West Midlands, on December 2
He had penned heartfelt notes to his boys and parents before his death
Police tried to save his life, but CPR efforts failed to revive him, Birmingham Live reports
Richard, a Birmingham-born electrician, was struggling after sad news he would no longer be able to see his children after a dangerous driving conviction
He was given the news as he was handed a two-year community order for theft, attempted theft, assault and dangerous driving in September last year
He was told he could not have contact until his sons turned 18, banned from driving for 18 months and ordered to pay £200 compensation alongside a £100 fine
Assistant Coroner Rebecca Ollivere recorded a verdict of suicide as the inquest concluded at Birmingham Coroner's Court on Tuesday, April 19
The inquest heard how he was suffering from emotionally unstable personality disorder, substance misuse, ADHD and drug-related psychotic symptoms
When he was first referred to the early intervention service at Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Trust in 2018, he had been motivated to engage
Miss Ollivere told the court: He struggled with his mental health and substance misuse
He also had a history of various suicide attempts over the years and he had ADHD
Richard was referred to the early intervention service, and he remained with them for three years
It became apparent during this time that his psychosis was not related to a specific mental health condition, but was due to his misuse of drugs
He was discharged into the community and allocated a care coordinator
But over the summer of 2021, he became very unstable and he was added to the waiting list for a hospital bed
While awaiting a bed, his mental state improved and after further review, it was decided it was no longer required, the assistant coroner continued
In September, he received upsetting news that he was no longer going to be able to have contact with his children
However, by November, his mental state had improved somewhat and he was engaging with services
Losing contact with his children led to Richard increasing his substance misuse and suffering from low moods
However, he was trying to engage with the services by attending cycling groups and narcotics anonymous
He managed to reduce his substance misuse and on December 1, he called his care coordinator, Geraldine Avis, to discuss his future
Richard was even humorous as he spoke of plans to go into town and get a job, get fit for the summer, buy a car and obtain a bus pass, she told the inquest
He gave no indication that he would harm himself, the court heard
But within hours, police officers were called to his Birmingham home - where he was sadly found dead alongside two suicide notes for his children and parents
The assistant coroner added: Later that night, officers were called to Richard's address after reports of a male with a knife
Sadly when officers gained entry to the property, they found him in his living room and despite CPR being attempted, sadly he could not be revived
No care or service delivery problems or missed opportunities were found in his care, a root cause analysis concluded

Kristian Jones, 12, has trouble sleeping and mum Gemma Jones sees her son change from a 'happy and smiley' boy to someone who will hurt them both at night A boy with autism hurts his mum and himself during sleepless nights caused by frustration
Kristian, a 12-year-old, has trouble sleeping and mum Gemma Jones sees her son change from a happy and smiley boy to someone who will hurt them both at night, Those who have Autism Spectrum Disorder can have sleep issues
It can lead to daytime tiredness, learning problems and behaviour concerns such as aggression and hyperactivity, The sleep issues affect other members of the family but also other family members and he repeatedly awakes in the night
Gemma hopes to raise money for a specialist bed, which cannot be funded by the NHS, she hopes will provide a safe space for Kristian
She told WalesOnline : Kristian was diagnosed with autism when he was two years old
The only way he can go to sleep is if I lie next to him, otherwise he would be up and about in the house, causing damage or chaos
Sometimes, he has bad days where he doesn't go to sleep before 5 o'clock in the morning and I'm left black and blue - he doesn't realise he's taking his frustration out
She added: It can happen seven days a week sometimes
He goes to stay with his dad over the weekends purely so I can sleep more than two hours and I can spend time with the other kids
It can be particularly challenging when he doesn't go to sleep until 5 or 6 o'clock in morning and I have to wake him at 8 to go to school - he's shattered
The summer holiday is the hardest time because obviously you are with him day and night
Whereas when he’s not on holiday and he’s in school, if he doesn’t sleep at all at night, I know I can get a couple of hours sleep in the day
In the summer holiday, I don’t have that option - once he’s up, he’s up
It does get draining and I’m so tired
When you’re tired, you’re prone to things like colds and cold sores
I’m constantly at the doctors getting cream because I come out a lot with cold sores when I’m tired or stressed
But also, you’re stressed for him - you can see his body wants to go to sleep but his body is still active
He’s frustrated and you understand why he’s frustrated and lashing out because he can’t switch off - it’s heartbreaking
As Kristian was recently diagnosed with epilepsy, lack of sleep can also cause more seizures
A specialist bed therefore would not only promote safe sleeping, but also a safe space for him during particularly difficult times
Gemma said: The specialist bed would include sensory objects and a camera
In that bed then, if Kristian is having a seizure, for example, I can see over the video
It’s not safe leaving him on his own in his room
So this bed would make it a safer environment for him - it’ll calm him down
I could be in the next room - I could go to bed, read a book or something, while he settles, feels safe and not anxious because he’s trying to go to sleep
It would be life changing for the family as well
The other two are older, it would be nice to be there for them as well, help them with school and other things
It would be nice to do whatever I have to do and know that he is also safe
It’ll be life changing for him and for us as a family
With the aid of her friends and family, Gemma hopes to fundraise for a £5,000 specialist bed for her son, with a walk up Pen-y-Fan set to take place at the beginning of June
The mum-of-three said that the response to the fundraising so far has been heartwarming
She said: Many of my friends and family are raising money, and we have got a lot of people coming together as a community
A specialist bed is over £5,000 - hopefully we’ll have the money and the bed set up by the summer holiday because it’s crucial
He’s a happy and smiley little boy, but obviously like anyone when he gets tired he gets grumpy
This will be life changing for him
When you have a child with disabilities, you feel like you are on your own, especially at 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning, you feel like you are alone there
Like most people, I don’t like asking for help and feel like I should be able to do this by myself
But the fact they are all coming together, without me even asking, it’s so heartwarming
I never thought anyone would go out of their way to do this
They have a lot going on themselves with Covid and their own families
I’d like to thank everybody for the kindness that they have shown

Coroner rules there were basic failings in the care of a six-year-old, who died of a rare kidney condition The tragic death of a six-year-old girl following a catologue of basic failures in her care has led to sweeping changes, at a hospital trust
Tragic Coco Bradford lost her life after several opportunities were missed by doctors and consultants to help her, an inquest heard
This included failing to order basic blood and stool samples or offering her a simple course of intravenous fluids to rehydrate her
The tot, who had autism, was even 'blamed' by medical staff for being uncooperative
Coco, 6, died from multiple organ failure on July 31, 2017, caused by an aggressive form of Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS), a rare kidney condition, as a result of bacteria e coli 0157
She’d been transferred to Bristol Children’s Hospital from the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro, where she had spent several days
Parents Rachel and Luke Bradford brought Coco to hospital on July 24, 2017, as their daughter had been vomiting, had diarrhoea and had spotted blood in her stool
They were sent home from the emergency department after being told she likely had Gastroenteritis but Coco’s condition did not improve, so they returned her to hospital less than a day later
An inquest into Coco’s death heard that doctors felt her condition was not serious, despite the family pleading for more to be done
Coco’s condition continued to worsen as she remained at Royal Cornwall Hospital for three days
She was moved to Bristol Children's Hospital on July 28, but sadly died a few days later
And her heartbroken mum Rachel told the coroner staff then 'unforgivably' tried to cover up their own failings by blaming her daughter's autism and claimed she was being difficult to treat
The inquest heard that there were several missed opportunities by doctors and consultants to catch Coco’s condition sooner
Coupled with delays to her being given fluids, antibiotics and a delay in the transfer to Bristol, doctors failed to check her blood pressure and nurses were too slow to send off stool samples for examination
Rachel, who told the hearing that she'd fought for four years to expose the truth and failings around her daughter's death, said earlier in the inquest that her daughter had been labelled uncooperative by hospital staff and that this was a reason care was insufficient
Fighting back tears, she said they discovered medical staff had multiple opportunities to change the course of Coco's treatment that could have saved her life
This was from the first trip to the emergency department right up until her transfer to ITU
She added: None were acted upon
We do not accept human error should be a factor
This was failing of the most basic level of care
There were notes blaming Coco for being uncooperative
She was in a terrible amount of pain and dying in front of their eyes
Despite the basic failings, senior coroner Andrew Cox said Coco was a hostage to fortune
He ruled that there was no medical negligence in Coco's care and no causal link between her death and the failings of Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust
However, he said sweeping changes had been made at the Royal Cornwall Hospital since Coco's death, such as double the number of paediatric consultants and a change to the team who organise transfers between hospitals
There is also now a more structured and robust handover for paediatric patients, more paediatric nurses and simulation exercises for both medical staff
The Senior Coroner ruled that the trust had 28 days to show evidence of new guidance to doctors in similar cases
I want to make sure lip service isn't just paid to this, he said
Mr Cox said the medical director of Royal Cornwall Hospital Dr Allister Grant had accepted that there had been some turmoil in the department following these events
He added: That had now settled and he was satisfied the paediatric department was suitably represented at care group level and provided a safe service
He said that Coco's death had been a catalyst for improvements
He said the team had made great strides in improving the service
After the inquest Dr Grant said the trust entirely accepts the conclusion
He added: We profoundly regret the failings in the care Coco received
While the coroner has concluded, based on the expert evidence, that different treatment would not have avoided Coco's tragic death, this does not take away from the fact that we let Coco and her family down
This is a matter of deep sorrow to those who cared for Coco, as was acknowledged during the inquest
We also regret Coco's family has been caused additional distress by the belief that Coco's poorly condition was explained by sepsis, as opposed to an overwhelming inflammatory condition called HUS (Haemolytic uraemic syndrome)
We note the coroner has concluded on the evidence presented during the inquest that Coco did in fact not have sepsis
The quality and safety of the care received by each and every patient is our highest priority
Following an independent investigation into her death a detailed action plan has been fully implemented and we will now ensure we review the coroner's conclusions with great care to identify any further learning that can improve the provision of care to children, including those with learning difficulties
Get email updates with the day's biggest stories Coroner rules there were basic failings in the care of a six-year-old, who died of a rare kidney condition The tragic death of a six-year-old girl following a catologue of basic failures in her care has led to sweeping changes, at a hospital trust
Tragic Coco Bradford lost her life after several opportunities were missed by doctors and consultants to help her, an inquest heard
This included failing to order basic blood and stool samples or offering her a simple course of intravenous fluids to rehydrate her
The tot, who had autism, was even 'blamed' by medical staff for being uncooperative
Coco, 6, died from multiple organ failure on July 31, 2017, caused by an aggressive form of Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS), a rare kidney condition, as a result of bacteria e coli 0157
She’d been transferred to Bristol Children’s Hospital from the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro, where she had spent several days
Parents Rachel and Luke Bradford brought Coco to hospital on July 24, 2017, as their daughter had been vomiting, had diarrhoea and had spotted blood in her stool
They were sent home from the emergency department after being told she likely had Gastroenteritis but Coco’s condition did not improve, so they returned her to hospital less than a day later
An inquest into Coco’s death heard that doctors felt her condition was not serious, despite the family pleading for more to be done
Coco’s condition continued to worsen as she remained at Royal Cornwall Hospital for three days
She was moved to Bristol Children's Hospital on July 28, but sadly died a few days later
And her heartbroken mum Rachel told the coroner staff then 'unforgivably' tried to cover up their own failings by blaming her daughter's autism and claimed she was being difficult to treat
The inquest heard that there were several missed opportunities by doctors and consultants to catch Coco’s condition sooner
Coupled with delays to her being given fluids, antibiotics and a delay in the transfer to Bristol, doctors failed to check her blood pressure and nurses were too slow to send off stool samples for examination
Rachel, who told the hearing that she'd fought for four years to expose the truth and failings around her daughter's death, said earlier in the inquest that her daughter had been labelled uncooperative by hospital staff and that this was a reason care was insufficient
Fighting back tears, she said they discovered medical staff had multiple opportunities to change the course of Coco's treatment that could have saved her life
This was from the first trip to the emergency department right up until her transfer to ITU
She added: None were acted upon
We do not accept human error should be a factor
This was failing of the most basic level of care
There were notes blaming Coco for being uncooperative
She was in a terrible amount of pain and dying in front of their eyes
Despite the basic failings, senior coroner Andrew Cox said Coco was a hostage to fortune
He ruled that there was no medical negligence in Coco's care and no causal link between her death and the failings of Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust
However, he said sweeping changes had been made at the Royal Cornwall Hospital since Coco's death, such as double the number of paediatric consultants and a change to the team who organise transfers between hospitals
There is also now a more structured and robust handover for paediatric patients, more paediatric nurses and simulation exercises for both medical staff
The Senior Coroner ruled that the trust had 28 days to show evidence of new guidance to doctors in similar cases
I want to make sure lip service isn't just paid to this, he said
Mr Cox said the medical director of Royal Cornwall Hospital Dr Allister Grant had accepted that there had been some turmoil in the department following these events
He added: That had now settled and he was satisfied the paediatric department was suitably represented at care group level and provided a safe service
He said that Coco's death had been a catalyst for improvements
He said the team had made great strides in improving the service
After the inquest Dr Grant said the trust entirely accepts the conclusion
He added: We profoundly regret the failings in the care Coco received
While the coroner has concluded, based on the expert evidence, that different treatment would not have avoided Coco's tragic death, this does not take away from the fact that we let Coco and her family down

Benjamin Davis, from Greater Manchester, was given the reference in the context that his autism diagnosis was. .
part of him but not all of him, a court heard A 22-year-old took his own life after being given a gravestone reference during a therapy session, a court heard
Benjamin Davis, also known as Binyomin Chaim Davis, took his own life only a few months after the session, having never got over that experience, his dad said
The young man was found at his home in Prestwich, Greater Manchester, and died at Salford Royal Hospital in November five days later
An inquest was held at Bolton Coroner's Court on Wednesday where private counsellor Avremi Rosenberg admitted that he should have used different wording in his session with Benjamin, who was 21 at the time
He also accepted that the language was inappropriate, reports Manchester Evening News
Mr Davis, Benjamin's dad, told the court that his son had a charming smile and was a special person
Speaking at the inquest, he said: We really miss him
He had a kind nature with a charming smile
He was a great student, he enjoyed photography, walking, and spending time with his family
He was a real pleasure to be with and he’s missed by family and friends
Despite his academic prowess, Benjamin struggled initially to fit in at school but eventually made a close knit group of friends
His challenges at school meant Benjamin was diagnosed with depression and anxiety in 2018, Mr Davis continued
The youngster was also diagnosed with autism in 2021, assistant coroner Rachel Syed heard
After this diagnosis, Benjamin had five counselling sessions with Mr Rosenberg in spring last year
And it was during these sessions in which Mr Rosenberg referenced a gravestone, Mr Davis said
He added: I asked Mr Rosenberg about it and he confirmed he did [say it]
When asked why used the imagery, Mr Rosenberg said he said 'in the context that his autism diagnosis was… part of him but not all of him'
He added: Benjamin approached me because he knew I was a counsellor with experience with working with people on the autism spectrum
In hindsight, this would have been better dealt with by the NHS
I did apologise to Benjamin for the way it came over
It was definitely not said in a blunt way
It was very much in the context that his autism diagnosis was very important and it was part of him but not all of him, and in that context what would be written on his gravestone
In the future whatever I can do to help you to come to terms about what has happened, I would properly arrange it
I express my sincerest, sincerest condolences
When asked by the coroner if his choice of words was inappropriate, Mr Rosenberg replied: Definitely, yes
Ms Syed said at the conclusion of the hearing that she would be writing a letter of concern to Mr Rosenberg’s organisation
She also will be writing letters of concern to Benjamin’s GP surgery Whittaker Lane Medical Centre and Greater Manchester Mental Health Trust (GMMH)
The coroner explained: A formal letter of concern will be written to the GP, GMMH, and the private organisation, highlighting the need to ensure a more collaborative working approach between these organisations and sharing information such as diagnoses of autism
I will also reference the need to have more training on autism as a condition
Earlier in the hearing, Benjamin’s GP in the final months of his life, Dr Rebecca-Ann Sheppard-Hickey, said she could not find a record of a formal autism diagnosis in his notes
Dr Ruth Watson, from GMMH, carried out an internal review of Benjamin’s care, and also admitted mistakes were made with clinical staff now receiving more in-depth training on autism
She said: The main focus is that staff need additional training on autism
It is going to be added to our clinical risk training as an additional focus point
Dr Watson did however add it was difficult to say if Benjamin’s death was preventable from the perspective of mental health services, as his last involvement with the service came around two months before his passing
Recording a verdict of suicide, Ms Syed confirmed that Benjamin’s medical cause of death was hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy
She concluded: I am sadly satisfied to the relevant legal threshold [Benjamin] intended to take his own life
I am therefore in law required to record a verdict of suicide
I hope you can focus on the wonderful memories you have of Benjamin

Nine family members have been found dead after a suspected suicide pact due to financial problems
They have been described as caring and animal loving by locals A 15-year-old girl was among nine members of a caring and animal loving family who have been found dead in what appears to have been a suicide pact over financial debts
The bodies were found in two separate houses that belonged to two brothers from the family in the Sangli district of Maharashtra, India
Only two cats remain alive at one of the homes with the family described as caring and animal loving by locals with a vet, Dr Manik Vanmore, among the dead
Police believe that the nine people died after consuming poison and that the family was going through financial problems, reported Indian Express
Suicide notes refer to repeated and public harassment that the family suffered from money lenders which was both mental and physical, it is reported
The ages of the family range from a girl aged 15, to a 72-year-old woman
The brothers have been named as Popat Yallapa Vanmore, 52, and Dr Manik Yallapa Vanmore, 49
The seven other bodies were identified as Sangeeta Popat Vanmore, 48, Archana Popat Vanmore, 30, Shubham Popat Vanmore, 28, Rekha Manik Vanmore, 45, Aditya Manik Vanmore, 15, Anita Manik Vanmore, 28, and Akkatai Vanmore, 72
Footage taken at the scene shows the corpses lying inside rooms
They were found by locals who noticed the front doors had not been opened for some time
Sangli's District Superintendent of Police Dixit Kumar Gedam said: Nine dead bodies have been recovered in Mhaisal village of Sangli district, out of which three bodies have been recovered from one house and six dead bodies from the other house
The forensic team is present on the spot
A police investigation is currently under way, with officers registering an unnatural cause of death
The bodies will be sent for autopsies
Fifteen people from the region, who have allegedly lent money to the brothers, have been arrested and the police are searching for 10 more suspects, reported Indian Express
A family friend Ashwini Sawant said that they were a caring family
I literally grew up in their home, he said, All of them were very caring and considered me as one of them
From all the special dishes cooked at their home to all the major events, I have been there
Less than a week ago, I came to their house for a paani-puri party
They were a happy family and loved animals
But I also know that over the past few years, they have been under stress because of debt
But we had never imagined this

Mum Nicola Caine from Cheshire slammed airline easyJet saying 'you wouldn’t even treat animals the way we have been treated after the family faced a string of problems, including two flight cancellations, multiple delays and no overnight accommodation A mum of an autistic child has told how her family was made to wait for two hours on the runway in an easyJet plane only to be then told the flight had been cancelled
Nicola Caine said they were due to fly from Manchester Airport to Tenerife at 5
10pm on Monday, but that the trip that they had been waiting for two years to go on, quickly turned sour, the Manchester Evening News reported
The Cheshire mum has told of her nightmare experience which included the flight being cancelled twice and her family being forced to sleep on airport floors
She was travelling with her husband and two children, with the cancellation causing a huge meltdown for her 12-year-old son who has autism, it is reported
First, the passengers were told that the flight was delayed by an hour, until 6
10pm, and Ms Caine said they had arrived at 2pm so as to be there with plenty of time
Then while they were able to board the plane just after 6pm, the waiting continued as there were problems with German airspace and then over baggage
She said: We were sat on the plane for an hour and a half
A pilot came and said ‘unfortunately, due to staff going over their hours, we are going to have to cancel this flight
’ The reaction on the plane wasn’t good at all
My son broke down in tears and screamed the plane down
Then we were told we couldn’t get off the plane because an Emirates plane had just arrived, and they take priority
So we sat on the plane for another 30 minutes
Luckily, the staff on the plane were really good, they let us go to the front of the plane to calm my son down
The problems for the Caine family continued after they got off the easyJet plane as they claimed they were stuck at Manchester Airport without information
She added Manchester Airport staff advised passengers to download the easyJet app to rebook new flights
But this was not without issues according to Nicola
She added: Everyone was trying to get on the app, but it was crashing
No-one could get on it at all
The app didn't work because we were on a package holiday
While we were stood there, two cancelled easyJet flights came through from Turkey and Egypt
So we were left, all these people from three flights, not knowing what would happen
Luckily, we live 30 minutes from the airport, so we decided to come home
We didn’t know whether to unpack because we didn't know whether we would be going on holiday or not
At 5:30am, Nicola received a text, telling her to be at Manchester Airport for 10:30am, where a coach would take them to Gatwick Airport to catch a flight to Tenerife at 7:10pm that evening
We were absolutely devastated, Nicola explained
We had not slept all night because my son was crying
I just thought, how can I go on a coach for almost five hours and sit in an airport for three hours, and then go on a four and a half hour flight? EasyJet said it was a suitable alternative and that we would lose our money if we didn'tgo on that trip
After arriving at Gatwick Airport, 240 miles away, Nicola booked her son an antigen test as his PCR had run out
At the gate, waiting to board the flight to Tenerife, the passengers had to wait over 30 minutes while the plane was cleaned
They were then told by easyJet that they could no longer operate the flight, but stand-by crew would be there for the flight in an hour
The family were then asked to return to departures, which raised alarm bells for Nicola, who suspected that the flight would be cancelled
She said: I questioned the staff because I knew this had happened the night before
They assured me that everything was fine
But we had to go back to departures, which was a tell-tale sign that we weren’t getting back on the plane
So we went back to departures and stood at the customer service desk for another 45 minutes
Again, there were no easyJet people there
At 9pm, we all got an email to say the flight was cancelled
The passengers were asked to move to another gate and look at new flights on the easyJet app, which angered Nicola
I was so angry because Ihad heard it all the night before, she continued
I told the staff, this happened at Manchester Airport, we cannot book new flights on the app because we are have a package holiday
A police officer advised us to stay in a hotel overnight
We said, why should we have to do that, t here should be a level of service
The nearest hotel was £690 for the night
We came back to the terminal and met the other passengers, not knowing whether we were going to fly, or get taxis for another four hours to go home- because what if easyJet book us another flight?

A spokesperson for easyJet told the Manchester Evening News: Unfortunately, we were unable to operate the EZY1903 from Manchester to Tenerife on Monday, due to air traffic control restrictions earlier in the day leading to the crew reaching their maximum operating hours

Rebecca Macdonald said her son was petrified of going to the toilet after the family's bathroom underwent renovations to fix a leak now has a slug infestation A mum has told how her five-year-old son is refusing to go to the toilet as her bathroom is infested with massive slugs
Mum-of-two Rebecca Macdonald, from Glasgow, has said her autistic son, Alexander, is living in fear of his own home because of a major slug issue
The family's bathroom underwent renovations to fix a leak but now has an infestation of slugs, the Daily Record reported
The home is managed by Queen's Cross Housing Association, which says it is working to fix the issue after being notified in March
Rebecca, who is a full-time carer to Alexander, said her son was petrified of the slugs and had begun bedwetting because he didn't want to go in the bathroom
The 25-year-old said: He is now at a stage where he is wetting himself at night-time because he doesn't go into the bathroom
Its really hard to see him kind of going back like that because of the house
It's really hard for him as he hates all creatures and stuff like that
So, getting up during the night to go to the toilet and finds slugs in the bathroom, he point-blank refuses to use the toilet
I'm having to pick them up and put them down the toilet pan or move them so my wee boy can go into the toilet
I'm also waking up during the night and the first time I went in I stepped on one, it was horrible
Rebecca said the issue began in January 2021 and she had spoken to her GP because of the stress caused
Shortly after the works, Rebecca started seeing slugs crawling all over her bathroom fixtures and floor
She said the housing association recently visited the property, after which more leaks were fixed and any holes sealed
However, after claiming to see another 10-12 slugs at the weekend, she called her GP
Rebecca said: I just spoke to my doctor about this as well because it's stressing me out, constantly having to argue with my housing association and not getting anywhere with them
My wee girl is only two, so she's at a stage where she wants to pick them up and I have to keep an eye on her
They are massive as well
I'm sending pictures and videos to the housing association
They told me to put salt down in my bathroom, which I've done and it has done nothing to keep them at bay
Jim Williams, maintenance manager at Queen's Cross Housing Association, said: We first knew about this problem in the property at the end of March and carried out an inspection that week
At that point we couldn't see signs of slugs
When Ms Macdonald reported the problem to us again this month, we arranged another inspection to try to identify the cause of the problem
This is an unusual situation but we are currently working with Ms Macdonald to try and resolve this issue to everyone's satisfaction
Get email updates with the day's biggest stories Rebecca Macdonald said her son was petrified of going to the toilet after the family's bathroom underwent renovations to fix a leak now has a slug infestation A mum has told how her five-year-old son is refusing to go to the toilet as her bathroom is infested with massive slugs
Mum-of-two Rebecca Macdonald, from Glasgow, has said her autistic son, Alexander, is living in fear of his own home because of a major slug issue
The family's bathroom underwent renovations to fix a leak but now has an infestation of slugs, the Daily Record reported
The home is managed by Queen's Cross Housing Association, which says it is working to fix the issue after being notified in March
Rebecca, who is a full-time carer to Alexander, said her son was petrified of the slugs and had begun bedwetting because he didn't want to go in the bathroom
The 25-year-old said: He is now at a stage where he is wetting himself at night-time because he doesn't go into the bathroom
Its really hard to see him kind of going back like that because of the house
It's really hard for him as he hates all creatures and stuff like that
So, getting up during the night to go to the toilet and finds slugs in the bathroom, he point-blank refuses to use the toilet
I'm having to pick them up and put them down the toilet pan or move them so my wee boy can go into the toilet
I'm also waking up during the night and the first time I went in I stepped on one, it was horrible
Rebecca said the issue began in January 2021 and she had spoken to her GP because of the stress caused
Shortly after the works, Rebecca started seeing slugs crawling all over her bathroom fixtures and floor
She said the housing association recently visited the property, after which more leaks were fixed and any holes sealed
However, after claiming to see another 10-12 slugs at the weekend, she called her GP
Rebecca said: I just spoke to my doctor about this as well because it's stressing me out, constantly having to argue with my housing association and not getting anywhere with them
My wee girl is only two, so she's at a stage where she wants to pick them up and I have to keep an eye on her
They are massive as well
I'm sending pictures and videos to the housing association
They told me to put salt down in my bathroom, which I've done and it has done nothing to keep them at bay

Local police in France have said that John Boyes, 63, hit his wife with a baseball bat before strangling her, then he hung himself but his family dispute the prosecutors account of events A British family has disputed the account of French police saying that a husband beat his wife with a baseball bat and strangled her before hanging himself
John Boyes and his wife Kathryn were discovered dead at their home in the Pyrenees
Local French police said that the 63-year-old British marathon champion beat his wife to a grisly death with a baseball bat before he took his own life
Officers claimed their idyllic life in France, where they ran a retreat while 65-year-old Kathryn worked as an artist, was a front for deeper issues
They said the couple, originally from Bournemouth, was experiencing financial difficulties because of a suicide note written on a computer
The couple had been dead for some time when police found them
But John’s brother, Robert, dismissed the murder-suicide theory
He said he spoke to his brother every Sunday and that he had never mentioned any issues with his marriage or money
Talking to The Times, he said: When I first heard they had died I assumed they were victims of a robbery because their house is in a remote area
I want the police to carry out a full investigation and not assume John killed Kath
John was a well-known long distance runner in the 1980s and combined a career in the Royal Mail with his athletics where he won marathons across the world
Him and Kathryn, who worked at Barclays bank in Southampton, met during a running camp in Lanzarote and the pair moved to France in 2004
They ran a specialised retreat for runners and cyclists and had guests included Steve Wray, the British 100km record-holder, and Chris Boardman, the Olympic gold-medal winning cyclist
Robert said that two years ago the couple found maintaining the five acre property too difficult so decided to retire
They sold up and retired to a smaller property nearby in Boudrac
Robert said that they both had their work pensions and were not far off claiming their state pensions as well
He added he couldn’t imagine his brother murdering his sister-in-law and said they had had a wonderful life in France
He also dismissed reports they had run out of money converting the house into holiday accommodation
After two weeks of not hearing anything from his brother, Robert became concerned and a friend, who was due to go cycling with John, discovered their bodies last Sunday
John’s Stava account showed that as recently as April 12 he completed a 3. 6mile run
The local prosecutor Christophe Amunzateguy said the John had hit his wife with a baseball bat before he strangled her
He then went into an annexe and hung himself, they said

Carrie Kearns, 40, from Bolton, was told by doctors that the reason why she felt so exhausted was because she had been masking all day and trying to fit in A woman discovered she had a life-changing condition after always feeling tired after getting home from work
Carrie Kearns, 40, only recently learned she had autism after struggling to fit in throughout her life and considering herself a loner
Doctors explained the reason why she felt so exhausted was because she had been masking all day trying to fit in
The mum-of-two, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, said she felt relieved by the discovery after the difficulties she has faced
It is a relief finding out you’re autistic because you realise there’s nothing wrong with me, she told Manchester Evening News
I understand the way I think and the way I act and I do things is normal for me and it’s okay to do those things and be that way
Autism is a lifelong developmental disability that typically appears during early childhood and can impact a person's social skills, communication and relationships
People with autism can struggle with some areas of communication and social interaction
They might also find it difficult to relate to people and understand their emotions, and have inflexible thought patterns and repetitive actions
Carrie was diagnosed with the condition around six months after speaking with her GP
She said: I read into autism and it was the only thing that fit and made a lot of sense
You can’t tell if someone is autistic but you can tell there’s something different about someone
My therapist said I was high-functioning because I have a husband and children

But when people say you’re high-functioning, the reason the labels are so misleading are because it takes something away from the individual but doesn’t speak for their troubles
I thought I was grumpy and snappy as a kid but those moments were meltdowns when everything got a bit too much and I was overwhelmed and over stimulated
That’s why I found social interactions so exhausting
Carrie started to read up on autism after her young son was diagnosed and she noticed similar traits within herself, especially from when she was growing up
Ever since I was a child, I noticed I was different, she said

I didn’t seem to be able to fit in with other children my age and I was always a bit of a loner playing out on my own
I was more interested in nature and playing with plants and bugs than the games my friends were playing
I was bullied a lot because I came across as weird
I never seemed to get them, the games they played or the way they spoke
There were a lot of misunderstandings because I would take things too deeply and miss the point
The way I would dress wasn’t in line with the fashion at the time and I wasn’t dressing the same as other people
As I got older, I found work was difficult because I would get in trouble for speaking my mind
I was quite passionate and it would come out as me being aggressive
I was so tired when I got back home from work
When I got diagnosed, I was told it was because I had been masking all day trying to fit in
The mum said she felt lucky for the speed of her diagnosis
She said: I was really lucky with the diagnosis because it didn’t take that long
I was only waiting around six months which is absolutely amazing

Golf pro gives lesson to brave William Verden, 16, who is being kept alive using dialysis and is at the centre of a court battle with doctors over his treatment Right-to-life battle teen William Verden enjoys a golf lesson – as his family gets ready for a court fight
The 16-year-old golf fan – battling kidney failure – was thrilled to get tips from pro Trevor Newsham
The Sunday People told last month how William, who also has autism, is kept alive by gruelling dialysis sessions, and doctors at Manchester Children’s Hospital say that his only option now is palliative care
Mum Amy and dad Will, disagree – arguing their son, who has focal ­segmental glomerulosclerosis, has a good quality of life and can even play golf twice a week
Trevor, 34, was impressed with his swing saying: He seemed really bright, taking it on board and hit great shots.  He’s got some ability
Amy, 45, of Newton, Lancs, said after Friday’s session at Heysham Golf Club in Morecambe: It was great.  He loved it
She and Will are now preparing to make an application to court after it was agreed medical mediation is not the right approach

Abbie Merrett, 33, and husband David, 37, had plans to make a £18,000 ground-floor extension, which would feature a sensory room for their severely disabled three-year-old Rory A couple have told how they have been left £7,000 out of pocket after a builder failed to deliver a sensory room for their autistic son
Abbie Merrett, 33, and husband David, 37, had plans to make a £18,000 ground-floor extension, which would feature a sensory room for their severely disabled three-year-old Rory
The sensory room would have provided Rory with vital specialist sleeping and caring facilities at their home
But they have now had to scrap their plans after a builder failed to show
The couple handed over the deposit last July but they said all they received was excuses for the work not even being started
Have you had a bad experience with builders? Email webnews@mirror. co
uk Abbie claims the trader told her he couldn't work because his van had broken down
He then allegedly proceeded to blame fuel shortages, having to attend a funeral and even heavy rain
The 33-year-old decided to take action in October and emails allegedly show that the builder promised to return her cash that day — but then said he could not as he had phone trouble
Four months on, she has still not received the money but has had to pay back the loan she had taken with family
She told The Sun : It’s been a nightmare, just so upsetting
She added that Rory had been struggling without a sensory room for this long and that it has left daughter Rozalyn, six, unable to sleep because her brother is crying or upset
A spokesperson from Nottinghamshire Police said: We are investigating a reported fraud offence and have been liaising with the person affected to gather the necessary evidence
When approached for comment, the unnamed builder reportedly said he did have the money ready to pay Abbie and that all she needed to do was to reply to his email
A Justgiving page has been set up to help the family pay for the sensory room.  Click here to donate

Nick Phillips, 39, was working the night shift on Tuesday, August 30, when he was alerted by a member of staff that a woman had reportedly locked herself in the toilets in the Winter Gardens in an apparent attempt to take her own life and was unresponsive An ex-army man turned Morrisons manager saved a woman's life inside the store toilets
Nick Phillips, 39, was working the night shift on Tuesday, August 30, at the Southport branch when he was alerted by a member of staff that something serious had happened
A woman had reportedly locked herself in the toilets in the Winter Gardens in an apparent attempt to take her own life and was unresponsive
After knocking on the door, Mr Phillips broke down the door to get to the woman
He performed emergency CPR on the woman and she began breathing again, reports the Liverpool Echo
Both the police and ambulance services were called, and the woman was taken to hospital where she would receive further treatment
As an ex-army and former prison officer, Mr Phillips knew exactly what to do
His previous training meant that he knew compact CPR, and he has a history of tending to people in need
His wife, Catherine Phillips, said: Because of his experience, his brain goes into this mode where he does exactly what he needs to do to get stuff done, I’ve never known anyone like him
He gets the job done, so when this happened, I don’t know who the girl is, but she couldn't have wished for anyone better to come and save her life
He is the most resilient person I’ve ever met in my life
Catherine said her husband stayed on shift for hours after the incident to ensure that his staff were okay and felt supported
A spokesperson for North West Ambulance Service said: I can confirm an ambulance attended and took a patient to hospital

The little boy, four, has been barred from Prince Avenue Academy and Nursery in Southend, Essex, for 30 days because he had been violent towards staff and dangerous with scissors, the school claims A mum who thinks her son could be autistic has blasted his school for removing him from lessons five times in six months
The four-year-old boy has been a pupil at Prince Avenue Academy and Nursery in Southend, Essex since September last year
He was suspended four times before his most recent punishment - a month-long temporary exclusion which started on January 29
His mum - who says she feels emotionally drained from the lack of support - claims she is yet to be told when he can return
The lad was excluded because he was being violent towards staff and had been dangerous with scissors, reports say
The working mum claims she made staff aware her boy could be on the autistic spectrum and that he gets frustrated and struggles with his emotions
She told the Echo: I have to accommodate the school so much and I have said from the start my son needs structure and routine and since all of this over the last six month, it has made his emotional wellbeing worse, which then affects his behaviour
It has made me emotionally drained and alone as it feels like no one is supporting me or him, and it is so upsetting to see my son feel that no one in the school likes him, he is down, unhappy, and it breaks my heart
The boy made significant progress with his emotions after teachers provided additional support at his pre-school, his mum claims
She added: This school has let me down, if he had the right one on one support going forward, he would been absolutely fine, but instead I get told ‘it takes a lot to deal with him’
Responding to the mum's complaint, headteacher Gary Clement told the Mirror that out of the 500 students at the school, just one has been temporarily excluded
Mr Clement said: We work hard to ensure that all the children feel valued and respected and enjoy learning in a safe, happy environment
In fact, Ofsted described our efforts to promote the development and welfare of pupils as ‘outstanding’, which I am incredibly proud of
In very exceptional circumstances we use short ‘fixed-term exclusion’
For context, in a school of almost 500, we currently have one child temporarily excluded
While it would not be appropriate to talk about the specific circumstances, what I can say is that we have specially trained staff who have been working closely with the local authority’s inclusion team and the family
We continue to work to find a sensible and satisfactory resolution

Local police in France have said that John Boyes, 63, hit his wife with a baseball bat before strangling her, then he hung himself but his family dispute the prosecutors account of events A British family has disputed the account of French police saying that a husband beat his wife with a baseball bat and strangled her before hanging himself
John Boyes and his wife Kathryn were discovered dead at their home in the Pyrenees
Local French police said that the 63-year-old British marathon champion beat his wife to a grisly death with a baseball bat before he took his own life
Officers claimed their idyllic life in France, where they ran a retreat while 65-year-old Kathryn worked as an artist, was a front for deeper issues
They said the couple, originally from Bournemouth, was experiencing financial difficulties because of a suicide note written on a computer
The couple had been dead for some time when police found them
But John’s brother, Robert, dismissed the murder-suicide theory
He said he spoke to his brother every Sunday and that he had never mentioned any issues with his marriage or money
Talking to The Times, he said: When I first heard they had died I assumed they were victims of a robbery because their house is in a remote area
I want the police to carry out a full investigation and not assume John killed Kath
John was a well-known long distance runner in the 1980s and combined a career in the Royal Mail with his athletics where he won marathons across the world
Him and Kathryn, who worked at Barclays bank in Southampton, met during a running camp in Lanzarote and the pair moved to France in 2004
They ran a specialised retreat for runners and cyclists and had guests included Steve Wray, the British 100km record-holder, and Chris Boardman, the Olympic gold-medal winning cyclist
Robert said that two years ago the couple found maintaining the five acre property too difficult so decided to retire
They sold up and retired to a smaller property nearby in Boudrac
Robert said that they both had their work pensions and were not far off claiming their state pensions as well
He added he couldn’t imagine his brother murdering his sister-in-law and said they had had a wonderful life in France
He also dismissed reports they had run out of money converting the house into holiday accommodation
After two weeks of not hearing anything from his brother, Robert became concerned and a friend, who was due to go cycling with John, discovered their bodies last Sunday
John’s Stava account showed that as recently as April 12 he completed a 3. 6mile run
The local prosecutor Christophe Amunzateguy said the John had hit his wife with a baseball bat before he strangled her
He then went into an annexe and hung himself, they said

Officers claimed their idyllic life in France, where they ran a retreat while 65-year-old Kathryn worked as an artist, was a front for deeper issues
They said the couple, originally from Bournemouth, was experiencing financial difficulties because of a suicide note written on a computer
The couple had been dead for some time when police found them
But John’s brother, Robert, dismissed the murder-suicide theory
He said he spoke to his brother every Sunday and that he had never mentioned any issues with his marriage or money
Talking to The Times, he said: When I first heard they had died I assumed they were victims of a robbery because their house is in a remote area
I want the police to carry out a full investigation and not assume John killed Kath
John was a well-known long distance runner in the 1980s and combined a career in the Royal Mail with his athletics where he won marathons across the world
Him and Kathryn, who worked at Barclays bank in Southampton, met during a running camp in Lanzarote and the pair moved to France in 2004
They ran a specialised retreat for runners and cyclists and had guests included Steve Wray, the British 100km record-holder, and Chris Boardman, the Olympic gold-medal winning cyclist
Robert said that two years ago the couple found maintaining the five acre property too difficult so decided to retire
They sold up and retired to a smaller property nearby in Boudrac
Robert said that they both had their work pensions and were not far off claiming their state pensions as well
He added he couldn’t imagine his brother murdering his sister-in-law and said they had had a wonderful life in France
He also dismissed reports they had run out of money converting the house into holiday accommodation
After two weeks of not hearing anything from his brother, Robert became concerned and a friend, who was due to go cycling with John, discovered their bodies last Sunday
John’s Stava account showed that as recently as April 12 he completed a 3. 6mile run
The local prosecutor Christophe Amunzateguy said the John had hit his wife with a baseball bat before he strangled her
He then went into an annexe and hung himself, they said

Billie Charity hit rock-bottom following the tragic death of her brother Stan
Here, the 47-year-old explains how focusing on her passion for photography helped her grieve and build a new life My most precious memories of my younger brother Stan are of us as kids
He was happy, beautiful and the sweetest boy in the world.  I adored him
We’d spend hours playing Lego and Monopoly together, and remained close into adulthood
I hold these memories close now – the boy he was and the relationship we had before his mental illness took hold in his thirties
Our parents separated when we were little
My dad would travel to an off-grid cottage in a remote valley near our home in Herefordshire to spend time with us
He was a fashion photographer and I still treasure the pictures he took of those sunny days
My mum also took wonderful photos of us, capturing family Christmases and our amazing garden, which she filled with sunflowers one year
Photography was a huge passion for the whole family
When Stan and I grew up, we lived together in London
I loved working at the BBC Learning department doing PR
But Stan never seemed happy and he returned to Herefordshire to live with Mum
I took photos all the time and my now-husband Dave and I would always take our cameras out at weekends
After a few visits back to Herefordshire, Dave fell in love with the area
He got on really well with Stan, which made me happy
I was feeling broody and the countryside felt like a better option, so we moved back and lived with Mum and my brother for a couple of years
I remember that time fondly
We ate together every night and took turns to cook
We played board games and pool, watched family TV favourites
Most importantly, we talked and reminisced
Some time later, unbeknown to any of us, my brother developed a serious mental illness
I’d had my first daughter and was suffering postnatal depression
Mum was also diagnosed with MS – things were pretty heavy
Me and Stan grew apart
I had another daughter shortly afterwards
I know Stan loved them both but I couldn’t understand why he appeared to have little interest in them and I resented this
He once told them they could have his old car as a play den
He once played pool with them, once bounced on the trampoline with them, once invited them to watch Scooby-Doo
But these gestures were few and far between
It became normal that Stan wasn’t very present in our lives
He never opened up to me about his mental illness and his unbearable suffering
Instead, it came out as anger and him not being very nice
Seeing him became deeply upsetting
I desperately missed my brother, my best friend, my confidant
Then, on Easter Sunday 2016, after several years of barely any communication, Stan turned up at my front door.  I was thrilled
We went for a walk but it soon became obvious something was really wrong
He was finally opening up but he was incredibly paranoid
I was happy that he was talking to me again – I was getting my brother back – but I was worried about him
He said he was very anxious and low, and felt something really bad was going to happen but he didn’t know what
I urged him to see a doctor but he convinced me everything was OK
The next weekend, there was a knock on the door in the middle of the night.  It was the police
Stan’s body had been found
He’d taken his life in the cottage where my dad used to take us as children
What happened next is a total blur
The type of grief that comes from sibling suicide is incredibly complex, especially when you’d been as close as Stan and I were
It’s like something outside of you that you have no control of
It hits you over and over, like a tidal wave
Eventually, I found others online who helped me understand what I was going through
Soon after Stan died, Dave and I moved with our daughters (then aged six and nine) back into Mum’s house
Initially, it was hard because there were signs of Stan everywhere
Each anniversary without him – every birthday, Christmas and Easter – brought further tidal waves of grief and I’d spend days in bed
Then, I rediscovered my camera
I had a strong urge to get far away from Herefordshire and took my eldest daughter to Hong Kong to stay with a cousin
I found solace taking photos of the amazing people and places we saw
Back home, photography became one of the ways I learned to live with my grief
A psychotherapist saw the link between my photography and my recovery
I looked up to Stan as a talented photographer – one of our last conversations was about photography
Two days before he died, he said he was happy and proud that I was pursuing my passion – and gave me his camera
Looking back, he obviously knew he wouldn’t be around for much longer.  He was saying goodbye
Six years after Stan’s death, I’m learning to live with the pain
But out of nowhere I can still get a sudden, sharp stabbing in the stomach that’s so powerful I can’t breathe
My physically healthy, handsome, intelligent, sweet, loved and loving brother is dead
And he died by his own hand
Did he realise that he’d never get to drive his beloved Alfa Romeo again, or play pool, or walk up his favourite mountain, or eat bacon sandwiches, sit in the sunshine? I’ll never see him again or hear his voice
Nor will I ever hug him and tell him he was one of the most significant and loved people in my life
Over the years, different emotions have crashed in and out; anger, guilt, hurt, sadness, confusion.  It’s overwhelming
But when Stan died, I suddenly saw life as extremely precious and short
I became fearless and threw myself into my photography
I’m now working full-time as a freelance photographer, have co-run a gallery and published three books
I’m living life for myself – but also for Stan
He’s always, always with me

An investigation has been launched into a mother's claims that her 14-year-old autistic daughter was strip-searched by Metropolitan Police officers A 15-year-old girl was left traumatised and suicidal after she was strip-searched by Met Police, according to her mum
The girl's mother claims her autistic daughter was strip-searched by Metropolitan Police officers
An investigation has been launched after the force confirmed the mum had made a complaint after she said the teenager was left traumatised and tried to kill herself
The mixed-race girl, whom the broadcaster referred to as Olivia, was said to have been out with friends when they argued
The two boys phoned the police alleging that the group had attempted to rob them at knifepoint
The report comes after a backlash over revelations that a 15-year-old girl, known as Child Q, was strip-searched by female Metropolitan Police officers in 2020 in the knowledge she was menstruating - after she was wrongly suspected of carrying cannabis at her east London school
Olivia's mother, whom the BBC referred to as Lisa, told BBC Radio 4's File On 4 programme that officers searched Olivia and her friends at the scene and the group were arrested in December 2020
Lisa said she told the officers on the phone that her daughter had autism and learning difficulties, and had been self-harming
Olivia was held in custody for more than 20 hours before being found to be in possession of a sharpened stick and a small blade, which her mother said was for the purpose of self-harming
The discovery, Lisa said, prompted six officers to forcibly strip Olivia and carry out an intimate search in the presence of male police
The youngster was then handcuffed and strip-searched, Lisa said
The mum said: Olivia was actually on her period at the time too
And they cut off her underwear in front of these grown male officers
She was absolutely distraught
Lisa told the broadcaster the experience had a devastating impact on her daughter's mental health
She added: She spent a lot of time in her room and she continued to self-harm in secret
And then, a few weeks later, she attempted suicide
The BBC reported Olivia later appeared in court accused of possession of a bladed weapon and was found not guilty after magistrates accepted the items were used for self-harming
Her family are bringing a civil case against the Met and are being represented by lawyer Gail Hadfield Granger, who has been contacted for comment
A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said: We have received a complaint from the girl's mother, which is currently under investigation
We have also received notification of a potential civil claim and therefore are unable to comment further at this stage
Deputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor told File On 4 that strip-searches help to keep children safe while in custody
He said: (The) worst-case scenario would be that we stop strip-searching in its entirety and a young child dies in custody because they are in possession of a knife or drugs that they use to harm themselves

The tearful boy said he was frightened he might hurt himself or others around him and asked for help as his mum tried to comfort and reassure him A brave family has shared a harrowing video of their 10-year-old boy in torment in an attempt to find him the mental health support he desperately needs
The youngster, referred to as James to protect his identity, tearfully pleaded for help to stop him from hurting himself or others in a heartbreaking video filmed by his mum Michelle
James' family, of Staffordshire, said his mental health has been in decline since the death of a relative six years ago and he has now started to have dreams in which he hurts people
His devastated mum and aunt said he regularly talks about stabbing himself or jumping off a bridge but that he has never been seen in person or offered medication by Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS)
Instead, they are forced to rely on monthly Zoom meetings which they said have not restarted since their appointment was cancelled in November due to staff illness, reports Stoke on Trent Live
Michelle, 44, told how she put her son's bed in her room and wakes up every time he rolls over in case he tries to go downstairs in the night and hurt himself
I'm really frightened that I won't have my little boy for much longer and that one day he will kill himself, she said
He keeps saying he is worthless and just causes problems for the family
He says he wants brain surgery so he can have part of his brain removed and forget
He doesn't feel like he can ever recover from this
He has lost hope and doesn't want to be here anymore.  He's only 10
He shouldn't be having these thoughts
When the family called the All-Age Access Team in desperation, they said they were told to keep an eye on him or take him to A&E
They have even tried contacting their local council's social workers and safeguarding team for help
But Michelle said it feels like they are in a vicious circle where they keep getting sent back to CAMHS, run by North Staffordshire Combined Healthcare NHS Trust
She added: I tell him he's my baby and so special to me, and that he is worthy to be here, because he is
He is a lovely boy and so affectionate
I feel so sick and useless because he is pleading for help and I can't get him the help he's begging for
James is currently waiting for an autism assessment through Caudwell Children and is only able to attend his mainstream school in the mornings due to his mental health
He was initially offered bereavement support following the death of his grandmother but the sessions did not take place when the then four-year-old told counsellors he did not want to participate
He also received 12 counselling sessions through his school but his family said they were told he needed more support than the charity were equipped to provide
It was at this point when they did a self-referral to CAMHS and began meeting regularly with school staff to help his teachers cope with him
They told how James can be disruptive in class by shouting out, climbing out of his chair and throwing things across the room
He also exhibits tics such as rolling his head and shoulders, repetitive coughing, clearing his throat and excessive blinking and tends to walk on his tiptoes
The little boy also talks obsessively about death and describes gruesome scenes in detail
Aunt Amy, 47, said: He loves destruction and disasters
He will talk about people falling out of planes, hitting the concrete and then getting run over by cars
He struggles with empathy and it doesn't bother him if people get upset by hearing it - he just carries on
We don't know where it has come from because he has never watched that kind of thing on television
James' mental health deteriorated further during Covid lockdowns and homeschooling left him inconsolable
Michelle said she has tried every parenting course she can find in an attempt to help her son who is academically bright but struggles socially
James, whose older sister has autism, was assessed for the disorder and ADHD by CAMHS four years ago but the family were told he did not meet the criteria and he was discharged
Since this summer, they have been having monthly Zoom meetings with CAMHS but feel their pleas for more urgent support are being ignored
Amy said: I just hope that by raising awareness we can help him in some way, which is why we filmed the video
We want to do everything possible to safeguard him and make sure his end goal doesn't happen
North Staffordshire Combined Healthcare NHS Trust said they were unable to comment on individual cases

Rho Miller says that her assistance dog Lyra has transformed her life after the Labrador helped her to become more independent I’m grateful for her beyond words, and that I love her with all my heart
Rho Miller says that's what she'd tell her beloved dog Lyra if she could explain how much the Labrador means to her
Lyra is an assistance dog for Rho, from Cornwall, and has been an invaluable addition to the 20-year-old’s life by helping her with everyday tasks she used to struggle immensely with
I already tell her every day how much I love her, and I wish she could truly understand what that means, Rho says
How much she has changed my life for the better
Rho was diagnosed as autistic back in 2019
I always suspected that something was different, even when I was younger, she says
I always struggled at school, especially with bullying
I often used to pretend I was sick so I wouldn’t have to go to school, in fear of what might happen that day
Rho says that even as an adult, she was terrified of going places on her own because of the panic and sensory overload that would come with visiting busy places such as supermarkets and shops
But since getting assistance dog Lyra, Rho’s life has been transformed
Rho has trained the gorgeous Labrador to help her with daily tasks, and having Lyra by her side has allowed her to do things that would have previously been unthinkable
Lyra has improved my well-being more than I could ever expect, Rho says
Because of her I am so much more independent, I have more confidence in myself along with a higher self-esteem, and I enjoy my life way more than I did before
She is my little companion and best friend - I often say she is my partner in crime! Lyra helps Rho with chores around the house, from assisting with laundry to keeping her owner company while she’s brushing her teeth or showering
This distracts me from my anxiety, stops me from getting stressed about the task that I’m trying to do, and reminds me that I’m not alone, Rho says
The Labrador can also do deep pressure therapy, which means putting her weight on Rho’s legs to keep her calm - this allows her owner to recover from sensory overload much more quickly
Without this, I would be frozen in place in a shutdown state for a long time, and I would be exhausted from this episode so much that I would not be able to do anything for the rest of the day, Rho explains
When the pair go out, Lyra can guide Rho safely around their environment by following directions, helping to find places such as a checkout or exit
Without Lyra guiding me, I would end up very lost, says Rho
Now I thoroughly enjoy going out, because Lyra keeps me safe and grounded
Although Lyra is incredibly focused and dedicated in her assistance dog role, when she’s off-duty the pup’s big personality is always making Rho laugh
As soon as you take her working harness off, and say the magic words ‘all done working’, she switches into the most energetic, playful, and humorous dog, and will run around the house grabbing her toys and showing them to you proudly
Rho shares her daily adventures with Lyra on her Instagram page @lifewithlyralab , and hopes that their heart-warming story will show others just how important assistance dogs can be in helping disabled people
Society teaches us that we are not enough; that we should stay at home, and that we need to act more ‘normal’ and ‘get over ourselves’ if we want to succeed in life, Rho says
But by having an assistance dog, we can achieve so much more than society gives us credit for, while still being ourselves

Alexandra and Giani Fodor want to pull their 11-year-old son David, who has autism, out of mainstream school and teach him at home, however they claim Harrow Council has refused permission A mum is at her wits' end after the local council refused to let her home school her autistic son
Alexandra and Giani Fodor, from Harrow, London, said their 11-year-old son David regularly suffers panic attacks at his current school
David is due to start at secondary education in September but Harrow Council has yet to find him a place at a suitable school
He recently had an epileptic fit, accompanied by a number of seizures, MyLondon reports
Heartbroken mum Alexandra said: It's so difficult watching him struggle
He finds it really hard to make friends and he has a lot of additional support needs
Every day when he comes home, he tells me that he is waking up anxious
He is just not able to progress in a mainstream school the way other children can
His current school is even saying that they can't meet his needs
David is currently a pupil at Whitefriars School, just a five minute walk from their home, but the problem with it being a mainstream school is that staff are unable to cope with his special educational needs
The school wrote to them to tell him that David would no longer benefit from continuing his learning journey with them
In a letter addressed to Alexandra from headteacher Mr Watson, and seen by MyLondon, he wrote: We must conclude that it would be ineffective and unfair on David to place him in our mainstream secondary setting when he so clearly needs additional support that we cannot provide and where his progress, and in fact his future life chances, would be limited
He added that 'a special school is the appropriate placement for David'
Initially, Alexandra and Giani found a new school nearby which is specifically designed for children with autism
They claim they were told that there was a 99 per cent chance of him being enrolled
In the past few weeks, the family was told that David no longer had a place at that school - sending them back to square one
With the family running out of time and options before David is due to start secondary school in September, they claim they enquired whether it would be possible to teach their son at home, but were told that it would not be possible
After going back and forth with a caseworker at Harrow Council, the pair say they have battled to come up with solutions which will benefit David in the long term and give him 'the education he deserves'

Sign up for the free Mirror newsletter People with autism often face huge struggles in the classroom, far more than their counterparts
Alexandra says that the biggest challenge David currently faces is getting timely intervention that will allow him to 'reach his full potential'
The family say they are now in contact with a lawyer who is willing to take up David's case, in a bid to help appeal against the decision
They insist they will continue to fight to get him a place in a school appropriate for him
The lawyers fees together with all the assessments needed to prove that David must attend one of these schools tallies up to £20,000
Alexandra has been forced to quit her job to help look after David, while they have already spent a lot of their savings trying to raise money, putting a huge strain on their family resources
A spokesman for Harrow Council said: We do our best to ensure all special needs pupils are offered a school place that is suitable for their needs
In this case, the parent’s preferred school deemed it would not have a suitable peer group for David
The parents can appeal this decision to the SEND tribunal
At present there are no other suitable special schools with vacancies
We empathise with David and his parents - and will continue to work with his existing school to ensure he is supported until an appropriate placement can be found
Emails seen from a Harrow Council caseworker sent to Alexandra explain that 'David is a high priority' when it comes to finding him a special needs school - but there is currently no capacity to offer further assessments or school places
A GoFundMe campaign has been set up to help the family pay for the assessments which they say will help David secure a spot at a special school
So far, £790 has been raised out of the £5,000 target

Leyla Gallagher, 10, from Leeds, craves friendship and loves people, but her autism, ADHD and Pathological Demand Avoidance (PDA) make social interactions and everyday expectations difficult for her A ten-year-old girl has been rejected by every school she has applied for, leaving her desperate for friendship and feeling different, her mum has said
Daniella Gallagher, 39 has said her daughter Leyla is big and bold and should not be hindered by the conditions that affect her
Leyla has autism, ADHD and Pathological Demand Avoidance (PDA) which makes social interactions and everyday expectations difficult for her
She has been out of school since June 2021, with local mainstream schools in Leeds finding it difficult to place her, Leeds Live reports
Daniella said : It's been hell for Leyla.  She's socially isolated
A lot of Autistic people have special interests - Leyla's special interest is people.  She's desperate for friendships
She's a 10-year-old girl that is full of life, energy
She's big and bold, has a great sense of humour, and is a fantastic character
She's desperate for friends but she can't maintain friendships well because she's not in a school environment where she can meet and see friends regularly
Leyla is of an age now where she's aware she's different and obviously that has a huge impact on her and her self-esteem
She hasn't identified how she fits in yet and who she is as a person and tried to copy other people
It's such a difficult time for her and she isn't in a school environment where she can work out who she is
Leyla was previously in mainstream education but began to struggle from around year one onwards
In 2019, she was diagnosed with Autism and ADHD, and Daniella started looking at alternative provisions Leyla could attend
She found her a place at a partnership school with an attached provision to start in January 2020
In December 2020, Leyla had PDA traits added to her diagnosis by CAMHS
Leyla's time at the alternative provision started off well, but she was affected by lockdowns, and quickly became anxious as before
In June 2021, the school admitted it couldn't meet her needs
Daniella said: Mainstream schools just looked at her as 'that naughty child'
While she was in mainstream schooling she was locked in classrooms when she was having meltdowns before she was diagnosed, Daniella said
She was running out of school with no shoes on onto main roads when she just seven years old
Getting her into school was a nightmare
The anxiety was so high, I'd have to peel her off railings
If I was successful I'd get a phone call within half an hour that she'd run out or had a meltdown
Even once she joined her new specialist provision in 2020, her anxiety got to the point of being through the roof - at that point, it was just impossible
She was trying to escape and abscond all the time
Since then, Leyla has been at home and out of full-time education while Daniella has desperately been trying to find somewhere that can accommodate Leyla
In the time since the summer, both Leeds City Council and Daniella have been contacting provisions across Leeds to see if they can fulfil her needs as per her Education, Health and Care Plan (EHC)
EHCs set out the specific needs of children with special educational needs in order to provide the support those children need
But so far, every single provision has said no - Daniella estimates Leyla has been rejected by 10-12 schools in the local authority area
One primary school said it could potentially meet Leyla's needs - but it has no space until 2023, by which point she will nearly have aged out of primary education
Daniella added: Leyla doesn't get the chance to experience lots of different peer groups and social interactions
We try to do lots of different activities, climbing, swimming, and more but she ends up stuck with me all the time
She's run away before, she's been bullied, she's been hit by people claiming to be her friends, she gets horrible messages
She's quite an intense person who doesn't really understand social boundaries all the time and that can make her very vulnerable for being bullied
It's really hard for her
According to Daniella, the reason Leyla has been refused many alternative provisions is that she is often too academic to fit in with the peer groups
Daniella also said she has had a nightmare trying to get hold of someone to speak to at the local authority since autumn 2021 to discuss suitable schools
She has since made an official complaint
The school Leyla was at until June 2021 have helped sort out a six to 12-week placement at a provision at another school in the area
But the provision isn't permanent as a solution.  It's heartbreaking for me
She's my baby and I want her to be happy
I know she will be amazing at whatever she does when she finds herself, Daniella said
She's a very strong, resilient, creative young girl and she's going to do amazing
Leyla changes and educates people all around her because she's that type of character
She will do amazing once she finds the place she fits in
It's hard to watch your child struggle so much
The gaps in her learning are just growing and growing and that's becoming more apparent as she gets older
I do worry about her future but I will help her do whatever she needs to do to get her GCSEs, whether she wants to do them later in life
My expectations for her currently are more around focusing on her social and emotional wellbeing
She added she was saddened by the fact that there are no options for children like her daughter
Daniella said: I can't make a school happen by clicking my fingers - there just seems to be nowhere out there for children like Leyla with PDA
There's very little knowledge in this area around the condition
We're lucky to have really good support groups in the area as there's also very little official support
I'm a single mum with two kids and they take up every second of my life
That can impact my own mental health - it's not easy
I used to work at a school but I had to leave my job because of all this
You don't realise until you're in this situation how dire it is
Even just trying to get a bit of help and support from anybody is impossible
A Leeds City Council spokesperson said: Whilst we are not able to comment on individual cases, the local authority is committed to work in partnership with parents and in the best interests of children
We strive to meet the provision needs of children with SEND and aspirations of parents and we take the concerns of parents seriously
PDA is a clinical diagnosis and therefore we are led by our clinical partners in their use of diagnostic terminology
Our statutory processes, consultation with specialist and mainstream settings and provision offer is not restricted by a diagnostic framework
We endeavour to work restoratively with all families to ensure children with SEND meet their aspirations and outcomes

Worried parents Rachel and husband Luke initially rushed Coco to hospital on 24 July 2017 but were sent home from the emergency department after being told she likely had Gastroenteritis A six-year-old autistic girl who died of sepsis after a 'catalogue' of errors was 'blamed' by medical staff for being uncooperative, an inquest heard
Coco Bradford lost her life after 'several opportunities' were missed by doctors and consultants to save her
This included failing to order basic blood and stool samples or offering her a simple course of intravenous fluids to rehydrate her, Cornwall Live reports
And her heartbroken mum Rachel Bradford told the coroner, staff then 'unforgivably' tried to cover up their own failings by blaming her daughter's autism and claiming she was being difficult to treat
Worried parents Rachel and husband Luke initially rushed Coco to hospital on 24 July 2017 but were sent home from the emergency department after being told she likely had Gastroenteritis
But she continued to pass liquid and bloody stools and could not hold down any fluids so was rushed back in less than a day later
The inquest heard upon admission, doctors still felt her condition was not serious despite the family pleading for more to be done
Her condition continued to deteriorate and she was transferred from the Treliske Royal Cornwall Hospital three days after admission to the Bristol Children's Hospital where she died of multiple organ failure caused by sepsis
Mrs Bradford, of St Ives, told the coroner on Monday she has fought for four years ever since to expose the truth and failings around her daughter's death at Treliske
Fighting back tears, she said they discovered medical staff had multiple opportunities to change the course of Coco's treatment that could have saved her life
This was from the first trip to the emergency department right up until her transfer to ITU
She added: None were acted upon
We do not accept human error should be a factor
This was failing of the most basic level of care
Every member of staff denied knowledge of bloody vomit and faeces yet it is in all notes
There were notes blaming Coco for being uncooperative
She was in a terrible amount of pain and dying in front of their eyes
The pathologist told the coroner Coco died on 31 July 2017 following withdrawal of intensive care and multi organ failure
She suffered Hemolytic uremic syndrome as a result of e coli 157
The inquest heard she had been transferred to Bristol Children's Hospital from Cornwall three days earlier
Rachel said the failures ranged from not ordering blood samples, giving her a pain score of 0, not picking up signs of sepsis and being not given an IV drip to rehydrate
She added: We have never been given the full details of the clinical picture and I'd like you to spare a thought how her sister Chelsea is feeling
A fellow clinician telling her not to worry and her little sister is fine
All concerns and questions around sepsis and e-coli dismissed - when actually she was dying
Had we not persisted and if Chelsea was not a healthcare professional, we would never know the truth of what happened to Coco
We are still waiting for the full truth l but I suspect that may never happen
Rachel added that she found all the failures, delays and lack of treatment staggering in this day of modern medicine
She said: Luke and I became more and more upset and concerned by the air of nonchalance of staff around her condition
It seemed they had no idea what was wrong with her
They did not recognise she was close to death
We were told she'd be fine and every time we asked we were told a stool sample was not needed or been requested
I felt they always thought I was overreacting and worrying for nothing every time we asked questions
Blaming Coco and her autism for their own incompetency and failure to treat her is absolutely unforgivable
Rachel said she had been told that e-coli 157 - if treated with aggressive fluid rehydration - had a survival rate of 97 per cent with babies and the elderly those who suffer worse
See what’s happening near you by entering your postcode below or visit InYourArea And she told the coroner the effect on her family of their loss had been indescribable
She added: To meet Coco was to love her
Her life with ours was getting better and better and she learned to communicate again
A week before she fell ill, I posted about how happy she was
She was in such a good place and we finally felt she would have the life she deserved and was going to mainstream school full time
If I could have sat in the bed with her and die as well, I would have done
Coco was my absolute world and living without her is almost too much to bear
Coco was a strong and healthy six-and-a-half-year-old
The effect on our family has been so deep and so divisive
Life will never be the same again
We are forced to live a life we did not want to.  We do not deserve
Not only have we lost beautiful Coco without the chance to live her life, we have been fractured to a level you will never understand

She said the family have spent four years battling and being lied to as she tried to get to the truth
We have been treated with the upmost contempt, she added
There have been tears, tears and more tears every single day
We just want the truth
You never know how it feels until it happens to you
Dr Saul Diaz Reales was the doctor who initially saw Coco in the emergency department at Treliske and sent her home
He told the coroner he had no evidence her blood pressure was not normal
He added: I would have wanted to see a blood sample if that was the case
In the benefit of hindsight it is difficult to have a case where Coco should not have been admitted
Looking at the evidence I had at the time I fail to see what I could have done better
He added he had 'no evidence' of there being blood in her stools and at the time was happy and satisfied to send her home
The inquest at Truro Coroner Court continues
Get email updates with the day's biggest stories Worried parents Rachel and husband Luke initially rushed Coco to hospital on 24 July 2017 but were sent home from the emergency department after being told she likely had Gastroenteritis A six-year-old autistic girl who died of sepsis after a 'catalogue' of errors was 'blamed' by medical staff for being uncooperative, an inquest heard
Coco Bradford lost her life after 'several opportunities' were missed by doctors and consultants to save her
This included failing to order basic blood and stool samples or offering her a simple course of intravenous fluids to rehydrate her, Cornwall Live reports
And her heartbroken mum Rachel Bradford told the coroner, staff then 'unforgivably' tried to cover up their own failings by blaming her daughter's autism and claiming she was being difficult to treat
Worried parents Rachel and husband Luke initially rushed Coco to hospital on 24 July 2017 but were sent home from the emergency department after being told she likely had Gastroenteritis
But she continued to pass liquid and bloody stools and could not hold down any fluids so was rushed back in less than a day later
The inquest heard upon admission, doctors still felt her condition was not serious despite the family pleading for more to be done
Her condition continued to deteriorate and she was transferred from the Treliske Royal Cornwall Hospital three days after admission to the Bristol Children's Hospital where she died of multiple organ failure caused by sepsis
Mrs Bradford, of St Ives, told the coroner on Monday she has fought for four years ever since to expose the truth and failings around her daughter's death at Treliske
Fighting back tears, she said they discovered medical staff had multiple opportunities to change the course of Coco's treatment that could have saved her life
This was from the first trip to the emergency department right up until her transfer to ITU
She added: None were acted upon
We do not accept human error should be a factor
This was failing of the most basic level of care
Every member of staff denied knowledge of bloody vomit and faeces yet it is in all notes
There were notes blaming Coco for being uncooperative
She was in a terrible amount of pain and dying in front of their eyes
The pathologist told the coroner Coco died on 31 July 2017 following withdrawal of intensive care and multi organ failure
She suffered Hemolytic uremic syndrome as a result of e coli 157
The inquest heard she had been transferred to Bristol Children's Hospital from Cornwall three days earlier
Rachel said the failures ranged from not ordering blood samples, giving her a pain score of 0, not picking up signs of sepsis and being not given an IV drip to rehydrate
She added: We have never been given the full details of the clinical picture and I'd like you to spare a thought how her sister Chelsea is feeling
A fellow clinician telling her not to worry and her little sister is fine
All concerns and questions around sepsis and e-coli dismissed - when actually she was dying
Had we not persisted and if Chelsea was not a healthcare professional, we would never know the truth of what happened to Coco
We are still waiting for the full truth l but I suspect that may never happen
Rachel added that she found all the failures, delays and lack of treatment staggering in this day of modern medicine
She said: Luke and I became more and more upset and concerned by the air of nonchalance of staff around her condition
It seemed they had no idea what was wrong with her
They did not recognise she was close to death
We were told she'd be fine and every time we asked we were told a stool sample was not needed or been requested
I felt they always thought I was overreacting and worrying for nothing every time we asked questions
Blaming Coco and her autism for their own incompetency and failure to treat her is absolutely unforgivable
Rachel said she had been told that e-coli 157 - if treated with aggressive fluid rehydration - had a survival rate of 97 per cent with babies and the elderly those who suffer worse
See what’s happening near you by entering your postcode below or visit InYourArea And she told the coroner the effect on her family of their loss had been indescribable
She added: To meet Coco was to love her
Her life with ours was getting better and better and she learned to communicate again
A week before she fell ill, I posted about how happy she was
She was in such a good place and we finally felt she would have the life she deserved and was going to mainstream school full time
If I could have sat in the bed with her and die as well, I would have done
Coco was my absolute world and living without her is almost too much to bear
Coco was a strong and healthy six-and-a-half-year-old
The effect on our family has been so deep and so divisive
Life will never be the same again
We are forced to live a life we did not want to.  We do not deserve
Not only have we lost beautiful Coco without the chance to live her life, we have been fractured to a level you will never understand

The little boy, four, has been barred from Prince Avenue Academy and Nursery in Southend, Essex, for 30 days because he had been violent towards staff and dangerous with scissors, the school claims A mum who thinks her son could be autistic has blasted his school for removing him from lessons five times in six months
The four-year-old boy has been a pupil at Prince Avenue Academy and Nursery in Southend, Essex since September last year
He was suspended four times before his most recent punishment - a month-long temporary exclusion which started on January 29
His mum - who says she feels emotionally drained from the lack of support - claims she is yet to be told when he can return
The lad was excluded because he was being violent towards staff and had been dangerous with scissors, reports say
The working mum claims she made staff aware her boy could be on the autistic spectrum and that he gets frustrated and struggles with his emotions
She told the Echo: I have to accommodate the school so much and I have said from the start my son needs structure and routine and since all of this over the last six month, it has made his emotional wellbeing worse, which then affects his behaviour
It has made me emotionally drained and alone as it feels like no one is supporting me or him, and it is so upsetting to see my son feel that no one in the school likes him, he is down, unhappy, and it breaks my heart
The boy made significant progress with his emotions after teachers provided additional support at his pre-school, his mum claims
She added: This school has let me down, if he had the right one on one support going forward, he would been absolutely fine, but instead I get told ‘it takes a lot to deal with him’
Responding to the mum's complaint, headteacher Gary Clement told the Mirror that out of the 500 students at the school, just one has been temporarily excluded
Mr Clement said: We work hard to ensure that all the children feel valued and respected and enjoy learning in a safe, happy environment
In fact, Ofsted described our efforts to promote the development and welfare of pupils as ‘outstanding’, which I am incredibly proud of
In very exceptional circumstances we use short ‘fixed-term exclusion’
For context, in a school of almost 500, we currently have one child temporarily excluded
While it would not be appropriate to talk about the specific circumstances, what I can say is that we have specially trained staff who have been working closely with the local authority’s inclusion team and the family
We continue to work to find a sensible and satisfactory resolution

Richard Farquhar, 61 - who murdered his wife in a jealous rage over an affair - took his own life after his release from prison was stalled and he was suspended from his charity shop job A murderer who killed his wife after discovering she was having an affair later took his own life in jail
Richard Farquhar became depressed about the possibility of delaying his release and after losing his prison placement at a charity shop
The 61-year-old was being held in HMP Greenock, in Inverclyde, Scotland, and, nearing the end of his sentence, had been moved to less restrictive procedures, including being given the new job
But he was suspended after his placement supervisor began to feel increasingly uncomfortable, according to a sheriff's report
Farquhar's mental health started to deteriorate after prison chiefs stopped moves to prepare him for release
A fatal accident inquiry was held virtually at the town’s sheriff court, with submissions made in February
Sheriff Andrew McIntyre issued a judgement in relation to the inmate's death on March 14, 2019
The determination was published earlier this month
Mr McIntyre said Farquhar died at 1am at Inverclyde Royal Hospital as a result of an injury sustained within a cell between 3
30pm and 4pm on March 13
Mr Farquhar’s death did not result from an accident, he added
The killer was sentenced to life with a minimum of 12 years for the murder of wife Anne in 2008 on the A90 road near Aberdeen, Scotland
The High Court in Edinburgh heard how she had kicked him out of their home in Cove Bay, Aberdeenshire, after she discovered he was having an affair with her friend
Anne then began seeing the same woman's husband and Farquhar stabbed her to death
Mr McIntyre said officials failed to provide him with detailed plans on what he needed to do to work towards his release or on how to access sessions with a psychologist
He concluded that if these actions had been taken the inmate's death may have been avoided
He said: I have found that Mr Farquhar committed suicide following a decline in his mental health contributed to by his suspension from a community placement
I have found that in the days and weeks prior to his death his imminent risk of suicide could not have been detected
I have also found that, as a result of the systems of working in place within HMP Greenock, and as a result of certain other factors, opportunities to safeguard Mr Farquhar’s mental wellbeing in the period before his death were missed
In particular I have found that: delay, a lack of joined-up working, and insufficient communication with Mr Farquhar, all contributed to him becoming distressed by his lack of progress, and to opportunities to avert that distress being missed
What crimes have been reported in your neighbourhood? Check with In Your Area
I find that those omissions contributed to his death
I find no cause for criticism of any of the professionals involved; it has only been possible to identify how things could have been done differently with the benefit of hindsight
I have made recommendations which I believe, if implemented, might realistically prevent other deaths in similar circumstances
The sheriff recommended several new guidelines for dealing with prisoners before release

Sergey Protosenya, 55, is suspected of killing his wife Natalya and his daughter, 18, at their villa in Spain but his son Fedor insists his dad is not a killer A Russian millionaire accused of killing his wife, daughter and himself was actually murdered, according to his son
Former gas tycoon Sergey Protosenya, 55, allegedly beat his wife Natalya, 53, and 18-year-old daughter Maria to death with an axe at their luxury Spanish villa before killing himself
It is one of four recent 'suicides' of Russian gas business executives who are believed to be linked to Vladimir Putin's circle, with their deaths widely considered 'suspicious'
Catalan police are still treating the deaths as a double murder-suicide
But Mr Protosenya's son Fedor spoke out on Tuesday insisting that his dad was not a killer and could never harm his family
His comments come amid speculation that the crime could be a triple mafia murder disguised as domestic violence
The 22-year-old university student spoke after arriving at the Costa Brava resort of Lloret de Mar where his relatives were found dead at their holiday home on April 19
My father is not a killer
He loved my mother and especially Maria my sister, Fedor told Mail Online.  She was his princess
He could never do anything to harm them
I don’t know what happened that night but I know that my dad did not hurt them
Josep Milan, the head of the regional Mossos d’Esquadra police force for the province of Girona, which includes Lloret de Mar, gave a recent update on the case
Speaking ahead of Fedor’s comments, he said: Investigators are focusing on a person who has committed suicide and two other people found dead inside a property and that is what we’re looking at
Everything points to it being a domestic violence crime, a double murder and subsequent homicide
The police chief described reports pointing to the possible involvement of the Russian mafia in the crime as speculative
A Mossos source insisted nothing has changed since Mr Milan spoke last week
They added: This is still being treated as a double murder and subsequent suicide
Fedor had stayed behind at the family home in the French city of Bordeaux while his relatives travelled to Lloret de Mar to spend their Easter holiday at their Catalan villa
He raised the alarm through a friend of his father’s last Tuesday morning after his phone calls to the house went unanswered
The friend alerted police who found Mr Protosenya hanging lifeless from a noose tied to a garden railing and the bodies of his wife Natalya, 53, and their 18-year-old daughter Maria inside
Police have been working on the theory Mr Protosenya, who had been deputy chairman of major Russian gas firm Novotek, attacked his daughter with an axe and knife while she slept before murdering his wife in the same way and then taking his own life
Local reports in the aftermath of the gruesome discovery said Fedor was quick to raise the alarm when he could not reach his family by phone because he had been left disturbed by the last phone conversation he had with them last Monday evening
The Spanish Government Delegation for Gender Violence has already registered Sergey’s wife as the 12th person so far this year in Spain killed by her partner or former partner - and the 1,138th since records began in 2003
Spain’s Equality Minister, without waiting for the court investigation into the crime to be concluded, left little doubt she believed Mr Protosenya was to blame in her condemnation of the murders last week by describing them as gender-related killings in a press address
The results of the autopsies have not been made public as is normal in Spain, although the information being released on the ongoing probe into the crimes has been limited by a secrecy order placed over it by the investigating judge

Child poverty charity The Childhood Trust today revealed how children have been impacted by the ongoing cost of living crisis - being left having self-harming and suicidal thoughts due to money worries Children are having suicidal thoughts because of the cost of living crisis, a report found
Britain is facing a ­humanitarian crisis on our doorsteps with children self-harming and unable to sleep because of money worries
Child poverty charity The Childhood Trust has today released a 33-page report into the effect the crisis is having on disadvantaged youngsters
They are warning millions of children are at breaking point
One little girl said she watches telly to try to forget her hunger
Laura, seven, of London, said: I ask my mother if we’ve any food and she’ll tell me if there’s enough money
If there isn’t then I just go in the cupboards and see if there’s something
If there’s a snack, I’ll eat it and try to go to bed
Tomorrow she might have more money
Another girl said: My mum was trying to pay for the electricity and we didn’t really have enough.  I felt really sad
It was really cold and I was really scared because the heater wasn’t working
The research by the Childhood Trust involved 1,468 parents, some to people aged over 18, with a third saying their children had been affected by the crisis
Of these 483 parents, nearly half said their kids are stressed, and a fifth said they smile less now
Nearly one in 10 reported children who have started self-harming while 8% said their kids have displayed suicidal tendencies
The Childhood Trust is aiming to raise £3
5million to help ­those in need
Chief executive Laurence ­Guinness said: It’s only thanks to donors and the thousands of ­charities supporting children that we aren’t facing a humanitarian crisis on our own doorsteps.  Donate at: championsforchildren. childhoodtrust. org

Brian Temple's mum described her son as happy go lucky but said the ordeal of incorrectly naming him as a paedophile caused him to become closed off and depressed An inquest heard how a man took his own life after police wrongly named him as a paedophile as a result of human error
Brian Temple was just 34-years-old when he died on December 31, 2017 - six months after being arrested on June 8 for allegedly stealing a pack of sausage rolls from Greggs
The inquest opened on Monday, June 20, and it heard that upon arriving home from custody, Mr Temple gave his release papers to his then-girlfriend, TeessideLive reports
Unbeknown to him, police had made an error in which they produced the wrong information on this document
The letter said he been in custody for inciting sexual relations with a 13-year-old girl, which he had not
Teesside Coroner's Court heard that Mr Temple's then-girlfriend began telling people of the incorrect information, which in turn caused people to lash out at the Redcar man
He was reportedly verbally abused in the street, attacked in his own home and hit around the head by a golf club
To deal with the onslaught he had experienced, the court heard Mr Temple began to drink heavily and take a mixture of both prescribed medication and recreational drugs, such as cocaine
Coroner Claire Bailey explained that a toxicology report carried out by Dr Cooper found Brian had 134mg of alcohol in his system
He was also found with a mixture of cocaine, Diazepam, Zopiclone and Pregablin - but these did not contribute to his death
Dr Cooper concluded that Mr Temple's death was as a result of hanging
His body was found by his brother Anthony, after his mum's partner, Paul Daley, became concerned that they had not heard from him all day
Coroner officer Nick Owen read statements from Mr Temple's brother Paul, sister in law Crystal and mum Mrs McLachlan, who has since passed away
His mum described her son as happy go lucky but admitted the ordeal with incorrect release papers caused him to become closed off and depressed
The court heard that after news spread of the release papers, Mr Temple reported threats and assaults to the police
The force's welfare checks reportedly made this worse and somewhat fuelled the fire of the incorrect rumours
His brother Paul, who was in attendance at the inquest at Teesside Magistrates Court, spoke of his closeness to his brother and how they'd grown up being anti-drug
Paul explained Mr Temple began taking drugs to cope with the constant attacks and assaults he was experiencing in the months leasing to his passing
Although he had depression, Paul said his brother never indicated suicidal tendencies and said the mistake on the release sheet would drive anyone mad

In her statement, Mr Temple's sister-in-law Crystal said the mistaken charge sheet was found in his pocket at the time of his death
She said she believed the police had a duty of care for vulnerable people such as her brother-in-law, as he was suffering from mental health issues at the time of his arrest
Officer Owen read out numerous statements from police officers who had dealt with Mr Temple in the run up to his death and around the time of his arrest and the incorrect papers being issued
Detective Sergeant Agar of Cleveland Police said in his statement that he had dealt with Mr Temple's complaint of the incorrect papers on November 28, 2017, and had said the bail sheet was a genuine human error
The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) began an investigation after Mr Temple's passing, so an error like this one would never happen again at Cleveland Police
They concluded that human error was the main judgement of the papers and this occurrence was incredibly unusual.  The inquest continues

Teesside Coroner's Court heard that Mr Temple's then-girlfriend began telling people of the incorrect information, which in turn caused people to lash out at the Redcar man
He was reportedly verbally abused in the street, attacked in his own home and hit around the head by a golf club
To deal with the onslaught he had experienced, the court heard Mr Temple began to drink heavily and take a mixture of both prescribed medication and recreational drugs, such as cocaine
Coroner Claire Bailey explained that a toxicology report carried out by Dr Cooper found Brian had 134mg of alcohol in his system
He was also found with a mixture of cocaine, Diazepam, Zopiclone and Pregablin - but these did not contribute to his death
Dr Cooper concluded that Mr Temple's death was as a result of hanging
His body was found by his brother Anthony, after his mum's partner, Paul Daley, became concerned that they had not heard from him all day
Coroner officer Nick Owen read statements from Mr Temple's brother Paul, sister in law Crystal and mum Mrs McLachlan, who has since passed away
His mum described her son as happy go lucky but admitted the ordeal with incorrect release papers caused him to become closed off and depressed
The court heard that after news spread of the release papers, Mr Temple reported threats and assaults to the police
The force's welfare checks reportedly made this worse and somewhat fuelled the fire of the incorrect rumours
His brother Paul, who was in attendance at the inquest at Teesside Magistrates Court, spoke of his closeness to his brother and how they'd grown up being anti-drug
Paul explained Mr Temple began taking drugs to cope with the constant attacks and assaults he was experiencing in the months leasing to his passing
Although he had depression, Paul said his brother never indicated suicidal tendencies and said the mistake on the release sheet would drive anyone mad

In her statement, Mr Temple's sister-in-law Crystal said the mistaken charge sheet was found in his pocket at the time of his death
She said she believed the police had a duty of care for vulnerable people such as her brother-in-law, as he was suffering from mental health issues at the time of his arrest
Officer Owen read out numerous statements from police officers who had dealt with Mr Temple in the run up to his death and around the time of his arrest and the incorrect papers being issued
Detective Sergeant Agar of Cleveland Police said in his statement that he had dealt with Mr Temple's complaint of the incorrect papers on November 28, 2017, and had said the bail sheet was a genuine human error
The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) began an investigation after Mr Temple's passing, so an error like this one would never happen again at Cleveland Police
They concluded that human error was the main judgement of the papers and this occurrence was incredibly unusual.  The inquest continues

Coroner rules there were basic failings in the care of a six-year-old, who died of a rare kidney condition The tragic death of a six-year-old girl following a catologue of basic failures in her care has led to sweeping changes, at a hospital trust
Tragic Coco Bradford lost her life after several opportunities were missed by doctors and consultants to help her, an inquest heard
This included failing to order basic blood and stool samples or offering her a simple course of intravenous fluids to rehydrate her
The tot, who had autism, was even 'blamed' by medical staff for being uncooperative
Coco, 6, died from multiple organ failure on July 31, 2017, caused by an aggressive form of Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS), a rare kidney condition, as a result of bacteria e coli 0157
She’d been transferred to Bristol Children’s Hospital from the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro, where she had spent several days
Parents Rachel and Luke Bradford brought Coco to hospital on July 24, 2017, as their daughter had been vomiting, had diarrhoea and had spotted blood in her stool
They were sent home from the emergency department after being told she likely had Gastroenteritis but Coco’s condition did not improve, so they returned her to hospital less than a day later
An inquest into Coco’s death heard that doctors felt her condition was not serious, despite the family pleading for more to be done
Coco’s condition continued to worsen as she remained at Royal Cornwall Hospital for three days
She was moved to Bristol Children's Hospital on July 28, but sadly died a few days later
And her heartbroken mum Rachel told the coroner staff then 'unforgivably' tried to cover up their own failings by blaming her daughter's autism and claimed she was being difficult to treat
The inquest heard that there were several missed opportunities by doctors and consultants to catch Coco’s condition sooner
Coupled with delays to her being given fluids, antibiotics and a delay in the transfer to Bristol, doctors failed to check her blood pressure and nurses were too slow to send off stool samples for examination
Rachel, who told the hearing that she'd fought for four years to expose the truth and failings around her daughter's death, said earlier in the inquest that her daughter had been labelled uncooperative by hospital staff and that this was a reason care was insufficient
Fighting back tears, she said they discovered medical staff had multiple opportunities to change the course of Coco's treatment that could have saved her life
This was from the first trip to the emergency department right up until her transfer to ITU
She added: None were acted upon
We do not accept human error should be a factor
This was failing of the most basic level of care
There were notes blaming Coco for being uncooperative
She was in a terrible amount of pain and dying in front of their eyes
Despite the basic failings, senior coroner Andrew Cox said Coco was a hostage to fortune
He ruled that there was no medical negligence in Coco's care and no causal link between her death and the failings of Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust
However, he said sweeping changes had been made at the Royal Cornwall Hospital since Coco's death, such as double the number of paediatric consultants and a change to the team who organise transfers between hospitals
There is also now a more structured and robust handover for paediatric patients, more paediatric nurses and simulation exercises for both medical staff
The Senior Coroner ruled that the trust had 28 days to show evidence of new guidance to doctors in similar cases
I want to make sure lip service isn't just paid to this, he said
Mr Cox said the medical director of Royal Cornwall Hospital Dr Allister Grant had accepted that there had been some turmoil in the department following these events
He added: That had now settled and he was satisfied the paediatric department was suitably represented at care group level and provided a safe service
He said that Coco's death had been a catalyst for improvements
He said the team had made great strides in improving the service
After the inquest Dr Grant said the trust entirely accepts the conclusion
He added: We profoundly regret the failings in the care Coco received
While the coroner has concluded, based on the expert evidence, that different treatment would not have avoided Coco's tragic death, this does not take away from the fact that we let Coco and her family down
This is a matter of deep sorrow to those who cared for Coco, as was acknowledged during the inquest
We also regret Coco's family has been caused additional distress by the belief that Coco's poorly condition was explained by sepsis, as opposed to an overwhelming inflammatory condition called HUS (Haemolytic uraemic syndrome)
We note the coroner has concluded on the evidence presented during the inquest that Coco did in fact not have sepsis
The quality and safety of the care received by each and every patient is our highest priority
Following an independent investigation into her death a detailed action plan has been fully implemented and we will now ensure we review the coroner's conclusions with great care to identify any further learning that can improve the provision of care to children, including those with learning difficulties

Ellen Martin, 25, from Surrey, said her life changed in a split second when she was diagnosed with the suicide disease which is so painful people often turn to suicide A footballer has described her daily living hell in which she feels she like she is being burned alive after a doctor diagnosed her with a horrifying disease
Ellen Martin, 25, from Surrey has played for women's teams including Aston Villa and Fulham, but after sustaining a knee injury while playing in November last year, her world was turned upside down
Six weeks after her operation to repair the torn ligaments, the sports coach noticed her leg would go from burning hot to ice cold and went back to her surgeon for answers
But Ellen was horrified when doctors told her you've been diagnosed with the Suicide Disease
The disease, which affects the central nervous system, causes indescribable pain and is usually brought on through trauma or injury
Medically known as Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS), the condition is nicknamed the suicide disease due to the number of people who would rather die than live with the pain
Ellen said: Instantly I turned to google to find out what CRPS was. .
and the result was the worst possible outcome I could have read
I immediately broke down, crying and screaming in tears
I feel like my body is being burnt alive
Imagine feeling like your body is being set on fire while being electrocuted
I just want my life back
Before the injury, Ellen had played for multiple football teams and enjoyed a healthy active social life
But now she claims her life has been put on pause, with doctors warning that the degenerative disease will slowly rob her of her functions and mobility as the pain worsens
She said: The McGill Pain Index, a scale rating of pain developed by McGill University, rates CRPS as the top pain humans can experience ahead of childbirth and amputation without anaesthesia
It is a living hell
My life has spiralled downwards from a split-second tackle in a football match
I have been unable to walk freely, sit in a chair normally, socialise with friends and family or work
My whole life has paused
The daunting reality of life with CRPS is isolating, terrifying and debilitating
My doctor hadn't even heard of the condition and believed the pain was 'inside my head'
I am already dosed up on medications that cause 'brain fog' and severe side effect on top of my CRPS pain
But despite the terrifying diagnosis Ellen says there is a glimmer of hope
After countless hours of research, the young footballer has found a clinic in the US giving hope to CRPS patients
Ellen has launched a GoFundMe to raise £30,000 to get her to The Spero Clinic in Arkansas, US for a 12 week intensive course which will treat her pain using holistic remedies
She said: I have found a glimmer of hope that I can return to the wonderful life I lived before my injury and diagnosis
I understand, just like myself, many may believe this is 'too good to be true', and naturally, I had these reservations, but when you're faced with the horrific reality of life with CRPS. .
going to this clinic will be the best thing I ever do
I have since spoken with numerous patients who have attended the clinic who are now in remission and honestly now believe it is the place I need to be
So please, if you can, help me on my journey to remission from CRPS
I will be forever grateful
It's impossible to articulate or put into words what the last five months have been like, so the thought of deteriorating further is truly terrifying

Jade Roberts, 26, took her own life just hours after taking a video laughing and playing with her kids in the garden and was described as a woman with a 'heart of gold' A young mum was found dead just hours after laughing with her children in the garden as she faced a hidden battle behind her brave facade
Jade Roberts, 26, from Liverpool, has been described as a woman who would do anything for anyone and had a heart of gold, but was suffering with anxiety and depression underneath her smiles
Now, her heartbroken mum Tracey says she is dedicated to ending the stigma over the silent killer, and said she had two choices when her beautiful daughter died suddenly and just hours after she was captured on video laughing with her children
Tracey described her daughter as an unbelievable mum as every minute of the day was dedicated to her children, but she never realised the true extent of what her daughter was going through behind the scenes
As Tracey herself spiralled deeper into a depression after Jade took her own life in April last year, she told the ECHO she could either spiral further and give up or make a positive change and help others
With the help of her loved ones, the trained psychotherapist began the process of setting up a project in her daughter's name
The Jade Roberts Project will soon be opening its building at Merseyside's 109 Rocky Lane which will help them provide workshops on anxiety, depression, suicide prevention and coping techniques as well as providing a counselling service
Those in suicidal crisis can access the project through a referral
After losing Jade to suicide last year, I've never experienced depression like it, said Tracey
I was stuck in my bedroom, crying all the time, no motivation
I was suffering PTSD, I wasn't sleeping
My daughter had to basically look after me
I have a lot of resilience and I had two choices
I could either go further and give up, but I went with the other choice, to help
I don't want anyone to go through the pain that myself and my family have gone through
The pain will never go away, I'm just learning to live with it
With the hope of ending the stigma and spreading the message that it's okay to not be okay, the family say it feels like Jade is still here as they create a legacy in her memory and for her children
Tracey added: After that I lived in the library, I did a lot of research
There's no help out there for people
I thought I have to change this
I truly believe everything I've learnt about the signs, all the knowledge I now have, Jade would still be here
A fundraising page was set up last year to kickstart the charity with the money going towards the renting of the building so people can attend when they are referred, as well as allowing the volunteers to get the relevant training
But more needs to be raised to ensure the help can continue, and more training can be undertaken to help save lives
The fundraiser, which will go towards training such as ASIST (Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training), can be found here
More information about ASIST can be found by clicking here

*In an emergency, dial 999 for urgent help Tracey added: The more people trained in ASIST the more lives can be saved, but it's over £100 per person
There's a five-day course in October that's £3,000 each but I truly believe with these skills, we can reach out to more
With the hopes of an open day on October 1 and the official launch of the project on October 3, Tracey is reaching out for more volunteers who are willing to help as well as support workers and counsellors
Those that are can email enquiries@thejaderobertsproject. co. uk
As well as a 10-week project focusing on mental health and a counselling service, Tracey has high hopes for the future in the form of a befriending service, yoga classes, walks in the park and hiring a minibus for days out
A billboard outside of their building will also spread the message that it's okay to not be okay
She said: Suicide is a silent killer, you can't see what's going on in someone's head
You can see a black eye or a broken leg and breaking that stigma, to me, is about more people coming forward and talking about how they are really feeling
It's about making people feel listened to and giving them hope

But it's in honour of my beautiful daughter to help people and save lives and while I'm doing this, it's like she's still here, her name is being mentioned all the time
In the hope of spreading awareness and raising further funds towards the project, Jade's siblings Danni and Jake will be bravely taking to the skies on September 24 at 2pm for a skydive

Kelly McEvatt, 38, posted on her local Facebook group to try and find the 'angel' who helped her son Nathan, who has autism A mum was blown away by a kind stranger who helped her 12-year-old son at a bus stop
Kelly McEvatt, 38, from Speke, Liverpool posted on a local Facebook group to try and find the 'absolute angel' who helped her son, Nathan, on his way to school on Monday, January 24
After saying goodbye to his mother, Nathan reached the bus stop where the school bus was already there
Kelly claims he knocked on the side of the bus but the driver drove away, leaving him behind
Nathan, who has autism, then became panicked and upset, Liverpool Echo reports
His mother said: He went to get his school bus as normal and the bus driver didn't wait for him
He was banging on the window and he drive off
Nathan started to panic, he has a lot of anxiety because of his autism and when he was upset trying to figure out what to do a woman stepped in and started talking to him
The woman, who was also at the bus stop, tried to stop the bus from leaving Nathan behind
When the bus drove away, she gave him £2 to get a public bus as he only had enough money for his normal school bus
Kelly said: Nathan rang me and told me what happened, he asked if he could get the [public] bus and I was nervous because he has only ever got the school bus before
I asked him if he knew where to get off and he did it
He got to school all on his own for the first time
When he got home he was buzzing that he got to school on his own
I can't thank the lady enough for what she did
It's amazing to know people are there to help my boy when he needs it
Writing in the Speke Past & Present Facebook group, she said: Just want to thank the lovely lady that gave my son money to get a bus to school this morning after his school bus failed to stop for him
My son is autistic and was quite panicked but thanks to you and some guidance by us on the phone, he made it to school all by himself
You have no idea how much this will do for his confidence and independence.  You're an absolute angel
The woman, Pamela Fox, saw the post and commented: Ahh this was me I've been thinking about him all day!! I tried to stop the bus when I seen him running but the bus just went!! I could see he was panicking and I'm so happy that he got to school okay
I had a little chat with him, he's a lovely little boy and reminds me so much of my son who is also in the same year just a different school.  So glad he's okay

Nathan started to panic, he has a lot of anxiety because of his autism and when he was upset trying to figure out what to do a woman stepped in and started talking to him
The woman, who was also at the bus stop, tried to stop the bus from leaving Nathan behind
When the bus drove away, she gave him £2 to get a public bus as he only had enough money for his normal school bus
Kelly said: Nathan rang me and told me what happened, he asked if he could get the [public] bus and I was nervous because he has only ever got the school bus before
I asked him if he knew where to get off and he did it
He got to school all on his own for the first time
When he got home he was buzzing that he got to school on his own
I can't thank the lady enough for what she did
It's amazing to know people are there to help my boy when he needs it
Writing in the Speke Past & Present Facebook group, she said: Just want to thank the lovely lady that gave my son money to get a bus to school this morning after his school bus failed to stop for him
My son is autistic and was quite panicked but thanks to you and some guidance by us on the phone, he made it to school all by himself
You have no idea how much this will do for his confidence and independence.  You're an absolute angel
The woman, Pamela Fox, saw the post and commented: Ahh this was me I've been thinking about him all day!! I tried to stop the bus when I seen him running but the bus just went!! I could see he was panicking and I'm so happy that he got to school okay
I had a little chat with him, he's a lovely little boy and reminds me so much of my son who is also in the same year just a different school.  So glad he's okay

Paula Halliday, 33, worked as an auxiliary nurse and after a number of failings from health services she took her own life as she struggled with a traumatic event where something happened in London A young mum has tragically taken her own life after a number of failings from medical services as she experienced a traumatic event the year before in London
Paula Halliday had struggled with her mental health and hadn’t seen her two young girls since the incident in October 2021
In the time since, on a number of occasions, she took overdoses and said she wanted to kill herself, Lancs Live reported
The 33-year-old from High Wycombe was being seen by mental health services - but a number of failings meant she didn’t receive the care she should have
When she killed herself, her body was found by her then partner and she had left a number of notes including one that simply read: It’s my time
An inquest into her death at Preston Crown Court heard how the auxiliary nurse began seeing Amy Cooper in September 2021
Speaking to the inquest, Miss Cooper said: I rang the crisis team once when she was texting me at night because she was just beside herself and I didn't know what to do
She was drinking a lot, every day
In October 2021 something happened in London and she was quite traumatised by it
She was seeing someone from the mental health team every week and they would ring her every other day to check in on her but she felt let down by them and said they weren't listening to her
She was always seeing someone different so she kept having to go over what happened every time and she found that really distressing
Samantha Ferguson, a matron at Lancashire Care which is part of Lancashire and South Cumbria NHS Foundation Trust which provides mental health services, admitted there had been several failings in Paula's care
The inquest heard that the team had been unwilling to start any psychiatric treatment or medication until Paula managed to reduce her alcohol intake
The matron said: Handovers weren't always fully completed and risks weren't always discussed.  It was sporadic
Some people had to look through the notes to familiarise themselves with her
She saw a number of different people at her face-to-face appointments which isn't ideal
What we would have liked to have been better was not necessarily more face-to-face appointments but better documented telephone calls and the ability to escalate a higher evidence of risk
And more face-to-face contact would have been expected given the high level of risk

The inquest, which was attended by a large number of Paula's friends and relatives, heard that a number of changes have been brought in at the trust
This included plans to increase staffing and issuing stricter guidance when handing over patients during morning meetings
Staff have also been trained on the importance of clinical curiosity, documenting clinical history and risk assessments
Claire Gibson, a consultant nurse at LSCFT, apologised to Paula's family for the failings in her care
She added: I want to apologise because there were some failings and I am really sorry
On the morning of January 13 this year Miss Cooper had driven to Paula's house to pick her up and take her to work
Although Paula hadn't replied to any of her texts this was normal given how heavily Paula had been drinking

Amy then went inside the house in Morecambe where she found Paula dead
Returning a conclusion of suicide Area Coroner Richard Taylor said he was satisfied that Paula had done a deliberate act with the intention of ending her life
Of course she was high risk and her frustrations about not getting the treatment she wanted are understandable, he added
In the notes she left she wasn't rambling
It was thought out and considered
The fact that so many people are here today goes to show how much she is missed and loved
A page on GoFundMe set up after Paula's death raised £730 in her name for the NSPCC
Friends posted their tributes to her in the comments with one describing her as a very special person while another said she was a beautiful lady

There was no note or any evidence to suggest army gunner Sophie Madden, 23, had planned to take her own life but coroner Katrina Hepburn returned a verdict of suicide There was no indication that a mum who was found hanged in an army shower block had planned to take her own life, an inquest has heard
Army gunner Sophie Madden, 23, originally from Wigan in Lancashire, was found dead in the shower block of the Saint Martin's Plain Army Training Centre in Folkestone, Kent
The mum-of-one had been on a night out with friends and colleagues the evening before her death, visiting a number of Folkestone pubs and playing pool in the barracks’ bar before heading to bed at around 1am on June 10
Sophie, a gunner in the British Army’s third Regiment Royal Horse Artillery, was seen heading towards the shower block shortly after, but this was considered normal as she often showered before bed
The next morning at around 9
30am a colleague went to the shower block and saw Ms Madden's belongings on a bench outside her preferred cubicle
She looked under the door and saw Ms Madden's legs, which raised the alarm, and once the cubicle door was opened it was found Ms Madden had hanged herself, the inquest in Maidstone heard on Monday
A report by Detective Sergeant Andrew West of Kent Police of the police investigation into Sophie’s death found no signs of third party involvement or criminal activity
The inquest heard there is no evidence she was expecting anyone to come in to the shower block and did not tell anyone she was feeling in any way suicidal, or made anyone aware of any issues when she went in
A toxicology report found she had 173mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood in her system, more than double the drink-drive limit, but friends who went out with her the night before said she had drunk less than she usually would
Ms Madden had no ongoing physical health issues, according to her GP, and she was not known to local mental health services
She had been placed on a vulnerability register by the Army in 2020 after she was seen hitting her head against a wall after drinking alcohol, but after two years of observation and weekly check-ups she was removed from the list in 2022
Colleagues said there were rumours Ms Madden had self-harmed and had a difficult upbringing, and in 2020 she was the victim of an alleged assault by the father of her son Jayden - however she declined to support a prosecution

One of Ms Madden's four sisters, Chantelle, spoke to her just hours before she took her own life and in her police statement said the news of Sophie's death was a total surprise and that Ms Madden was so well loved
She said Ms Madden had claimed she was stressed that her phone was broken and she did not have the money to fix it, and also that she was facing a bill for damages caused by her pet dog at her previous Army accommodation
In a statement, her sister said: Sophie was a strong, independent woman, and didn't tend to worry about things
I told her I'd send her some money and a spare phone the next day, but I didn't have any concerns for her safety or mental health
There was no note or any evidence to suggest premeditation, but coroner Katrina Hepburn returned a verdict of suicide at the inquest held in County Hall, Maidstone on Monday
The coroner explained: I'm satisfied it was Sophie who did the act . .
and there is no evidence of anyone else being involved
I have to consider whether Sophie intended to take her own life or if it was a cry for help
There is no evidence she was expecting anyone to come in and didn't tell anyone she was feeling in any way suicidal, or made anyone aware of any issues when she went in
I am satisfied she did in fact intend to take her own life, and satisfied all other scenarios have been ruled out
Therefore a conclusion of suicide is needed on the balance of probability

An inquest has heard how Bailey Reay, 13, sent a heartbreaking 'final goodbye' voice-note to his crush, before being found unresponsive at his grandmother's home A 13-year-old schoolboy sent a heartbreaking final 'last goodbye' message to a girl he fancied before his tragic death, an inquest has heard
Bailey Reay, from Sunderland, was found unresponsive at his grandmother's home where he lived on 19 December 2020
Emergency services were immediately called, but he was tragically pronounced dead - leaving his family and friends devastated, report Chronicle Live
An inquest - held at City Hall on Wednesday - heard how Bailey resided with his grandmother
On December 18, he was left in the care of his grandmother's aunt and they spent some time together eating pizza
It was also heard how Bailey also spent some time in his room playing on his PlayStation
But, by midday on December 19, Bailey was found unresponsive and the emergency services were called but he tragically passed away
The teenager was found in his room with an empty bottle of medication that was originally prescribed to his grandmother
A post-mortem was carried out and toxicology was taken and it was found that Bailey had alcohol and medication, which was eight times a large therapeutic dose, in his system
The pathologist found that Bailey died as a result of the effects of the medication and alcohol which it was heard can impact the central nervous system
The inquest heard there were a number of things that caused Bailey concern including difficult family dynamics and school though recent records suggested he had got back into school and that it seemed to be going well
Following Bailey's death, some concerns were raised over the issue of bullying and police seized his computer and mobile phone which was protected by a pin
However, the inquest heard that nothing specific was identified
However, they did find a voicemail that Bailey had left a girl who he had a crush on which said: I have had a crush on you for the longest time so I guess this is goodbye
Assistant coroner, Karin Welsh, said Bailey had admitted taking medication in the voicemail he left to his crush and recorded a verdict of suicide
She told his family: Why doesn't fall within the remit of an inquest
There were a number of factors in Bailey's life that must have been causing him concern

Lorna Hewitt, 43, and her husband Craig, 42, kept Matthew Langley, 22, locked in the attic of their home in Sheffield, South Yorks
for seven months - they were both found guilty of false imprisonment and of causing or allowing a vulnerable adult to suffer serious physical harm The mum of an autistic man who was found close to death weighing six stone and locked in an attic, has been found guilty
Lorna Hewitt, 43, and her husband Craig, 42, kept Matthew Langley, 22, locked in the attic of their home in Sheffield, South Yorks.  for seven months
Matthew was found inside the vomit and faeces-covered room severely dehydrated and weighing just six stone (39kg)
The Hewitts denied keeping him captive but today a jury found them guilty at Sheffield Crown Court
The couple were found guilty of false imprisonment and of causing or allowing a vulnerable adult to suffer serious physical harm
Matthew was found by paramedics seriously underweight, dehydrated and with his life hanging in the balance, the jury was told
Nicholas Campbell QC, prosecuting, previously said the ambulance service was called to the home in the early hours in June 2020
He was rushed to an intensive care unit in a pitiable state with abrasions which indicates that he had been moving around on all fours, the prosecutor told the court
He had suffered damage to a kidney with high sodium levels relating to severe dehydration, it was heard
Mr Campbell added: His sodium levels were dangerously high.  They measured 180
They were so high they could shut down his brain and kill him
Anything above 145, there is a real chance of death
The Home Office pathologist examined the injuries and said the abrasions and bruises were consistent in his view with Matthew having been crawling on all fours over objects in his path

Cops found faeces and vomit in the attic bedroom all over the floor and bedding, a jury was told
The room was filled with buzzing flies, a bad smell and a key on the outside of the door, the court heard
Matthew, who has suffered from irritable bowel syndrome, incontinence, arthritis and learning difficulties, had weighed only six stone (39kg) when he was found, Mr Campbell said
He weighed eight-and-a-half stone (53
6kg) just seven months earlier in November 2019, the court heard
However, Mr Campbell said Matthew made a good physical recovery thanks to the hard work of medical professionals and he was discharged weighing 55kg

Hewitt told police his wife had found Matthew upstairs lying on the floor and he claimed his stepson had been fed and that he ate in his room
He also claimed after police found a key on the outside of Matthew’s bedroom door that there had been locks on the internal doors because their home used to be student accommodation
He also Hewitt stated to police that Matthew had only been locked in at night because he would go downstairs and set off security alarms
Matthew's mum chose to give no comment answers to all questions asked by the police, the court heard
Mr Campbell told the jury: It’s a matter for you that you may think that as the pressures grew they were prepared to gamble with his health in order that he would be taken off their hands and be looked after by others
Matthew's stepdad chose not to give evidence during the trial but his mum told the jury her son stopped having respite stay-overs because he became fed up with going to the care centre
But Mr Campbell claimed if they had not cancelled the respite care stays he received he would never have ended up in hospital fighting for his life
The mum further claimed during the trial that Matthew was not enjoying himself at the care home and that he wanted to go home
She said she had been anxious leaving Matthew alone on a couple of occasions but there were no other times when he was left alone and she tried to make him as safe as she could
Mr Campbell said the couple had started locking Matthew in his room at night but she claimed he had been left downstairs when they went out
The jury found them guilty after deliberating for a day

She said she had been anxious leaving Matthew alone on a couple of occasions but there were no other times when he was left alone and she tried to make him as safe as she could
Mr Campbell said the couple had started locking Matthew in his room at night but she claimed he had been left downstairs when they went out
The jury found them guilty after deliberating for a day

The woman claims two hooded youths approached her property on Almond Tree Avenue in Coventry, at around 10
30pm last Wednesday and began hurling eggs at her windows and a brick at her car A terrified mum-of-two has said she and her two autistic sons have been left 'on edge after her home was wrongly targeted in an attack
The woman, who has not been named, claims two hooded youths approached her property on Almond Tree Avenue in Coventry, at around 10
30pm last Wednesday and began hurling eggs at her windows
A few minutes later, after hearing a noise sounding like someone had been shot, she realised the rear windscreen of her car had been shattered by a brick
It is said to have caused both emotional and financial distress for the victim as the car that was damaged was a courtesy car that she was using while her own vehicle was being repaired
She told CoventryLive : A neighbour came down, heard the noise, thought someone had been shot
Initially I thought just eggs had been thrown at the house, then I realised my car had been damaged
Speaking about the emotional impact the random attack has had on her family, the victim said: I live alone with my two autistic boys, one has just turned 21 and the egg hit his bedroom window
He is very on edge
She believes that her home was wrongly targeted, saying: I believe it may be mistaken address for a targeted attack, as we rarely go out or interact with people locally - keep ourselves to ourselves
A spokesman for West Midlands Police said: We've received a report of criminal damage after a brick was thrown at a car in Almond Tree Avenue, Coventry, at 10
20pm on Wednesday (April 13)

Anne Deegan Hunt, from Southport, Merseyside, said she was left 'distraught' when a KFC manager refused to turn off the loud music which left her autistic granddaughter screaming The family of a disabled girl with autism claim they were left distraught and forced to leave a KFC restaurant when staff refused to turn off their loud music
Anne Deegan Hunt, 61, from Southport, Merseyside, was taking her daughter, Leila, nine, for a day out to the Eastbank Street branch of the fast food train restaurant on Saturday, March 26
But the grandmother of eight said Leila who has learning disabilities and autism was left screaming from the table tops when a staff member refused to turn off their in store music
Speaking to the Liverpool ECHO she said: Leila had managed to get on to a table and was screaming for the music to be turned down
The whole shop could hear her
I explained she was autistic and asked the employee at the counter if he could turn the music off
He told me he would have to talk to the manager
Distressed Leila began hitting herself as they waited for the music to stop playing Anne claims
But when the employee returned, Anne said that the manager had relayed a message that the music could only be turned down not off
She said: Anne had started punching her stomach
She has a Stoma had so she was at risk of causing serious harm to herself
The employee was really understating and he apologised but the manager didn't even come out to see what was going on
Leila who also has Goldenhar Syndrome and suffers with social anxiety can find it difficult to find activities she enjoys doing outside of the house
Her gran added: Because of her autism she has built up anxiety about going out and she only enjoys doing certain things
I was more upset for Leila because that's one of the few thigs that she likes to do
Anne eventually managed to get Leila off the table but had no choice but to leave said: I don't think turning the music off would have spoiled anybody's dining experience
It's probably more distressing to watch a child in that state
As they wouldn't turn the music off the situation was just getting worse
I was left feeling distraught and Leila's disability wasn't accommodated at all
A KFC spokesperson said: We’re really sorry we didn’t get this one right
We want our restaurants to be a welcoming place for everyone, and we’ve followed up with the team to ensure it doesn’t happen again
We’d like to make it up to the family and would love for them to get in touch with our Care Squad to give us the chance

Sergey Protosenya, 55, is suspected of killing his wife Natalya and his daughter, 18, at their villa in Spain but his son Fedor insists his dad is not a killer A Russian millionaire accused of killing his wife, daughter and himself was actually murdered, according to his son
Former gas tycoon Sergey Protosenya, 55, allegedly beat his wife Natalya, 53, and 18-year-old daughter Maria to death with an axe at their luxury Spanish villa before killing himself
It is one of four recent 'suicides' of Russian gas business executives who are believed to be linked to Vladimir Putin's circle, with their deaths widely considered 'suspicious'
Catalan police are still treating the deaths as a double murder-suicide
But Mr Protosenya's son Fedor spoke out on Tuesday insisting that his dad was not a killer and could never harm his family
His comments come amid speculation that the crime could be a triple mafia murder disguised as domestic violence
The 22-year-old university student spoke after arriving at the Costa Brava resort of Lloret de Mar where his relatives were found dead at their holiday home on April 19
My father is not a killer
He loved my mother and especially Maria my sister, Fedor told Mail Online.  She was his princess
He could never do anything to harm them
I don’t know what happened that night but I know that my dad did not hurt them
Josep Milan, the head of the regional Mossos d’Esquadra police force for the province of Girona, which includes Lloret de Mar, gave a recent update on the case
Speaking ahead of Fedor’s comments, he said: Investigators are focusing on a person who has committed suicide and two other people found dead inside a property and that is what we’re looking at
Everything points to it being a domestic violence crime, a double murder and subsequent homicide
The police chief described reports pointing to the possible involvement of the Russian mafia in the crime as speculative
A Mossos source insisted nothing has changed since Mr Milan spoke last week
They added: This is still being treated as a double murder and subsequent suicide
Fedor had stayed behind at the family home in the French city of Bordeaux while his relatives travelled to Lloret de Mar to spend their Easter holiday at their Catalan villa
He raised the alarm through a friend of his father’s last Tuesday morning after his phone calls to the house went unanswered
The friend alerted police who found Mr Protosenya hanging lifeless from a noose tied to a garden railing and the bodies of his wife Natalya, 53, and their 18-year-old daughter Maria inside
Police have been working on the theory Mr Protosenya, who had been deputy chairman of major Russian gas firm Novotek, attacked his daughter with an axe and knife while she slept before murdering his wife in the same way and then taking his own life
Local reports in the aftermath of the gruesome discovery said Fedor was quick to raise the alarm when he could not reach his family by phone because he had been left disturbed by the last phone conversation he had with them last Monday evening
The Spanish Government Delegation for Gender Violence has already registered Sergey’s wife as the 12th person so far this year in Spain killed by her partner or former partner - and the 1,138th since records began in 2003
Spain’s Equality Minister, without waiting for the court investigation into the crime to be concluded, left little doubt she believed Mr Protosenya was to blame in her condemnation of the murders last week by describing them as gender-related killings in a press address
The results of the autopsies have not been made public as is normal in Spain, although the information being released on the ongoing probe into the crimes has been limited by a secrecy order placed over it by the investigating judge

Police, coastguard and RNLI teams conducted a search of the North Wales coast over several days and eventually recovered the body of Garry Jones after he left his family home in Stoke-on-Trent A man sent a heartbreaking final text to his wife before his body was tragically found in the sea
Garry Jones, 55, had left his family home in Stoke-on-Trent on January 5 to stay at a Travelodge in Cheshire
However, the following day, the warehouse worker sent a text to his wife of 19 years, Christine, which caused his family concern
The devastating message read: Please tell everyone that I love them and that I am so so sorry
He gave details of the location of his belongings, before signing off with a final message, sorry for everything, love you, reported North Wales Live
Garry was reported missing shortly afterwards - with his body found the sea in March by a catamaran crew five miles from Rhyl
Senior coroner for North Wales east and central, John Gittins, heard details of the police investigation that followed Gary's disappearance
North Wales Police used number plate recognition software and traced his car travelling towards Towyn on January 6
Later that day officers found Gary's car parked on St Asaph Avenue in Colwyn Bay
Whilst he was not present, officers discovered a note inside the vehicle, signed by Garry, which contained the message: I am so sorry for any heartbreak or upset that I have caused or will cause by my actions
Police, coastguard and RNLI teams conducted a search of the North Wales coast over several days but no trace of him was found.  At 3
22pm on March 3, 2022, Rhyl Coastguard received a call from the crew of windfarm crew transfer vessel, Mareel Onyx, who reported they had found a man's body in the water around five miles from the Rhyl coast
A DNA sample confirmed it was Garry as the inquest was told he had visited his GP before his death with concerns for his mental health and had been signed off work
In a statement, Garry's wife said an accident at work and the declining health of his father had affected his mood, and he had started crying more
Mr Gittins gave the cause of death as drowning and recorded a conclusion of suicide
Addressing his family, the coroner said: I suspect that some of the not knowing is worse than the knowing
The only comfort that I can offer is that he was found
It is little degree of solace but I hope it can provide some closure for you

South Ayrshire Council is looking into claims a seven year-old boy, who is autistic, was left terrifiedafter he was deemed to have been disruptive in the classroom and placed in an isolation room An investigation has been launched after a furious mum claims her autistic son was placed in an isolation room without her knowledge
South Ayrshire Council is looking into claims a seven-year-old boy, who is autistic, was left terrified after he was deemed to have been disruptive in the classroom and was placed in an isolation room
The worried mum, who we are not naming, has withdrawn her boy from the unit, claiming the treatment he suffered was abhorrent, cruel and sadistic, Daily Echo reported
She said: I feel people need to know how our children are treated and changes need to be made
My son was locked in the room for being too vocal and refusing to do a task, which in turn upset the other children
He was not a danger to anyone or himself
Just a regular upset autistic child
Why on earth, is a specialist unit using a locked empty room as a behavioural tool? It’s absolutely abhorrent
I was told he was in there for 15 minutes, a long time to be terrified and screaming for help.  It’s cruel and sadistic
The parent also claimed she knew nothing about the incident until her son came home upset and revealed what happened
She said: I was not notified of this by staff, instead just told 'he had an unsettled morning when asked to complete a task
' He was so upset he told me as soon as he came home
He will not be back (to the unit)
I will be seeking a referral on to somewhere that treats their disabled pupils humanely and values their wellbeing
And I will be making an official complaint with the education department
The unit has written to the mum to apologise that she wasn’t informed her son had accessed the quiet room after he experienced an unsettled morning
They also said it is protocol to call home straight away after any incident
The letter continues: Appropriate forms were completed after the event, sent to the learning and raising standards mailbox and to the inclusion co-ordinator within the correct timeframe for reporting
The letter goes on: These events are then discussed at the Inclusion Monitoring Group and discussions take place as to whether anything can be done differently, or in any additional supports may be needed
This is standard practice for any child who may need to access the quiet room
The school said the child was in the 'quiet space' less than 10 minutes, and supervised by a class assistant at all times
According to the British Psychological Society, the use of isolation booths is not backed by evidence, has been proven not to be effective and breaches the UN convention on the rights of the child
A South Ayrshire Council spokesperson said: A complaint in relation to the allegation has been received and will be investigated and progressed through the council’s complaints process

Ian Chapman called the police after greeting a young man on a Lancashire bridge as he walked past with his dog and realising he was looking straight through him A passerby prevented a young man from taking his own life after spotting an eerie clue in his face
Ian Chapman, from Padiham, Lancashire, was walking over a bridge as he crossed paths with the stranger but after saying hello he realised there was something off
The 61-year-old noticed an absence of emotion in the man's eyes, as though he was looking straight through him
He realised he was going to take his own life and called the police, reports LancsLive
Ian said: I was walking past this gentleman who didn't reply to me
When I said hello and I turned around and he was climbing over the edge of the bridge
I offered him my phone, to see if there was anyone he wanted to ring
Then I thought, what am I doing? He could have just lost a family member and that could be really triggering for him
So, I turned away and called the police
Have you been affected by this story? Let us know at webnews@mirror. co
uk By the time Ian got to the end of the bridge, the police had already arrived
However, the dad-of-two didn't want to stay at the scene much longer and set off home
Ian said: I was just walking and my dog scared this lady who was tending to her garden
She saw me crying and asked if I was OK and if I wanted to come into her house
I just told her that I needed to get back home to my wife and I explained what had just happened
Her house was next door to a halfway house type place, so she came to tell me later on that the man had been saved
Although the gentleman was saved, Ian has no further update about him
The experience has stuck with him and a year on, Ian recognises that charities, particularly local ones, rely on funding which they often have to fight hard to get
Now, off the back of the incident he witnessed and his previous love of fundraising, Ian will be doing a walk, completely barefooted from Burnley to Bacup - a total of seven miles
Burnley born and bred, Ian decided he wanted to do the barefoot walk after brainstorming words that begin with the letter B, choosing the starting point, destination and how he'd go about it
His love for raising money came after the coronavirus pandemic which saw employees at his work laid of for one week every month
He said: Since April this year, one week a month we get laid off due to a shortage in the supply chain
So, I decided I needed another focus and I was thinking, what can I do? I was contemplating things beginning with a B for Burnley and it went from there, my wife thinks I'm off my head
Ian will be raising money for Casual Minds Matter CIC, a Burnley based charity that help to provide professional support and counselling to men who are struggling with their mental health
I've never really seen anyone who's had to battle with depression or alcohol or drug abuse or anything like that, Ian continued
It's just never really been something that the people around me have suffered with
What is happening where you live? Find out by adding your postcode
I obviously knew people were living with it but I didn't fully appreciate to what degree people lived with it
When I do my walks, I carry my trainers with me and it's like a safety net if I decide I want to give up
People that are suffering don't always have those safety nets though and that's why I'm raising money for the charity
I just want to make people aware that if you need help, there's always someone just a phone call away
Ian has been gearing himself up for his walk, which will take place on Saturday, August 20 from St
Catherine's Community Centre to the Cornerstones pub in Bacup

Police search teams spent eight hours searching for Kyuss Williams, four, who wandered away from his parents' house before he was found dead in a pond just ten feet away from the home A frantic search for a missing four-year-old boy with autism ended in tragedy when he was found dead in a pond by rescue teams
Kyuss Williams and his family were visiting a relative in their new apartment in Stone Mountain, Georgia, when the little boy wandered away without his parents realising
The alarm was raised shortly afterwards at around 6
20pm with teams searching for several hours.  At roughly 2
30am his body was found in a pond just ten feet away from the home
It is believed he drowned
DeKalb County Police Department put on Facebook : Please help us find 4-year-old Kyuss Williams, who has wandered away from 1251 Fair Pines Cove
He is 3’6, 42 lbs, with black hair & brown eyes
He was wearing grey pants and a white shirt
If you see him please call
A short update later read: Thank you to all who shared.  Kyuss has been recovered
DeKalb County Police Chief Mirtha Ramos said: The family was in the residence when they realised the child had left the residence
They didn’t know where the child was
They added in a statement: Kyuss was recovered around 2:30 a. m
this morning in a nearby pond
We extend our condolences to the Kyuss’ family during this time and we thank everyone who worked to find him
A neighbour told Fox 5 searchers initially did not focus on the pond but further down the street as CCTV showed the little lad walking in that direction
It was only later search teams scoured the area and found him unresponsive in the water
Neighbour William Brown said dog teams finally found him
He added: ' Fire department, helicopter, you name it — they had it out here
They had the dogs, and I think that’s how they knew the baby was in the water
Other demanded a fence be erected around the pond the avoid the tragedy happening again
Delores Watson added: They've been looking for this baby since earlier yesterday, and for them to just find this baby at like 2:30 in the morning it's downright wrong.  I don't understand
I can just pray for the parents
Police confirmed an investigation has been launched but no foul play is considered

Popular and well-respected travel manager, Jennifer Joynt, 36, was found dead in her home after the love of a 'toxic partner' who allegedly faked his cancer consumed her A famous businesswoman was found dead after her whole life turned upside down and 'messed up' by a man who allegedly faked having stage four cancer in a bid to control her
Jennifer Joynt, 36, a supply chain manager, was tragically found dead in her bed by her dad, after he forced his way into her home in Manchester on February 26, report Manchester Evening News
Her family became concerned about her after they hadn't heard from her in days
An inquest into her death, held at South Manchester Coroner’s Court, heard the woman - who was born in Stockport - had experienced problems with her mental health in the past
The court heard that family and friends supported her during these difficult periods of her life
The inquest also outlined that while there were signs Ms Joynt was considering suicide, she did not appear to have taken her own life
Notes addressed to her family and friends in notebooks were found by police, scattered around her room
There were also notes on her phone, as well as video messages recorded for her loved ones, in the months before her death
Police found that while some of these notes had been edited on her mobile, there was nothing to indicate they were true indications that she intended to take her own life
Similar notes had also been written on other occasions, which had not led to her attempting to take her own life
There was evidence that Ms Joynt had attempted to purchase a particular drug, which has appeared in several other suicide inquests recently
While police were able to establish that most of the companies the 36-year-old reached out to had declined the sale
There was one purchase attempt that had not been declined, but officers were unable to establish whether the sale had gone through and whether the substance was delivered
Police said they could not find any evidence of packaging or a container for this substance in the home, although when Miss Joynt’s phone was unlocked by officers, they discovered that she had been visiting a site instructing her on what medications to take alongside this substance to take her own life
Traces of these drugs were found within her system
Professor Hunt, the pathologist who performed the post mortem examination of Miss Joynt, gave her cause of death as aspiration of gastric contents
This means that food or fluid she had consumed had caused a blockage in her windpipe or lungs
Toxicology results showed a range of non-lethal levels of various drugs in her system, but these were not highlighted as contributing factors to Miss Joynt’s death
Ms Joynt's mum, Margaret, told the court about her bubbly and strong daughter who embraced life and loved fitness and travelling
However, she also said an extremely toxic relationship in the months before her daughter's death consumed her, with the young woman unable to let go of her partner who allegedly faked having stage four cancer in a bid to control her
After a tough few months of set-backs, things started to look up for Miss Joynt, with the young woman in the process of buying a new house, set to start a new job just weeks after her death, and even taking trips away with friends and making plans to spend time with those around her
Her dad told the court his daughter spoke to people that were struggling and actively tried to help them and just seemed to love life so much, leaving her family feeling like she was finally turning a corner and starting to get better after a horrific ordeal
Senior coroner Alison Mutch recorded a narrative conclusion that Miss Joynt died from complications of asphyxia, as it was impossible to tell on the balance of probabilities whether or not the young woman had ingested something in an attempt to take her own life
Addressing Ms Joynt’s family she said: As a family you were devoted to each other and as parents you had supported her
She was obviously very popular and very successful, and was extremely well thought of at work and she had a very bright future ahead of her
She was extremely fortunate to have such a caring family
Ms Joynt’s family established the Jenni Joynt Foundation, which aims to help others who have faced, or are facing similar mental health challenges to which she succumbed
The 39-year-old was a well-known and hugely popular figure across the business travel industry
She had worked as a travel manager at NatWest Group/RBS since 2016, and was best-known as a long-time member of the Institute of Travel Management (ITM) and as an active and passionate member of its Northern Regional Committee
During her spare time, it is reported that she enjoyed a range of fitness activities, including open water swimming
ITM celebrated her life at its annual conference in Birmingham in April, with its CEO, Scott Davies, paying tribute to her
He said: Jenni was an incredibly special, vibrant and energetic member of the ITM community
Her natural desire to make everyone feel welcome and valued set the tone at our events and struck anyone that she met
Jenni’s warmth, humour, empathy and talent were admired by so many of us
Jenni would simply light up a room and any situation you can imagine – a business meeting, an education session, a conference, a gym class, an evening in a bar – was just infinitely better if Jenni was there
We miss her so much already and we will always remember her, and we will look to find positive ways to help those facing struggles any way we can

New research by Deaths by Welfare concludes the Department for Work and Pensions failed to fix systematic flaws in the disability benefits system that potentially led to thousands of deaths You can listen to an audio version of this article here The Government’s failure to act on warnings about its disability benefits systems has been linked to hundreds – maybe even ­thousands – of suicides and other deaths of disabled people
A detailed 160-page study published today exposes how the Department for Work and Pensions was alerted more than 40 times to life-threatening systemic flaws, by academics, coroners and its own researchers over the past 30 years
The Mirror has been given exclusive access to the Deaths by Welfare Timeline, which brings together for the first time the three decades of ­investigations linking DWP and its social security reforms with the deaths of disabled benefit claimants
It documents the DWP’s cumulative harm and slow bureaucratic violence that has led to countless suicides and other deaths, particularly in the post-2010 austerity era
One piece of research connects just one area of the 2010 coalition government’s welfare reforms with an extra 590 suicides between 2010 and 2013
By Rachel Charlton-Dailey, guest editor and founder of The Unwritten Disabled Britain: Doing It For Ourselves, is a week-long series across the Daily Mirror's print and digital platforms, showcasing the lives of disabled people and the issues important to us
The articles have been conceived by disabled people, written by disabled people, and photographs - where possible - taken by disabled people
Throughout this week, we aim to change your mind about how you view disabled people
After all, there are 14 million of us, and we aren’t all the same, it’s time the public stopped listening to lazy stereotypes and viewed disabled people in all our wide-ranging splendor
To read more on The Mirror's week-long series click here Disabled activist Ellen Clifford, author of The War on Disabled People, who provided key input into the Timeline, said it was an enormously important piece of work
She said: Welfare reform has destroyed lives and caused avoidable harm on such a scale that the United Nations made a [2016] finding of grave and systematic violations of ­disabled people’s rights
At the most extreme end this has meant the loss of life
We will probably never know the true number
The culture of dehumanisation and hostility fostered within the DWP to justify the government’s conscious cruelty has meant a complete lack of ­accountability or remorse
The Timeline ­represents an important step in the continuing battle for justice for the victims of welfare reform
Work and pensions ministers have repeatedly been warned of the harm caused by the assessment system, mostly to claimants of out-of-work disability ­benefits such as ­incapacity benefit and employment and support allowance but also the personal independence payment, which was introduced in 2013
As far back as 1995, Professor Nick Wikeley, who would later become an Upper Tribunal judge, was warning new social security legislation would leave marginal groups with ­inadequate protection against the risk of long-term illness
In 2006, Professor Alison Ravetz warned that if the then Labour government was wrong about its proposed incapacity benefit reforms the cost, in stress, to those people and their families will be ­incalculable
Those reforms were rolled out, first under Labour and then – with even harsher restrictions – under Tory-led governments
In March 2010 came the first indication from a coroner the reforms – the work ­capability ­assessment (WCA) and the ­employment and support allowance (ESA) – were having the impact of which Ravetz had warned
Stephen Carré, 41, had taken his life two months earlier after his appeal against being found fit for work was rejected
Coroner Tom Osborne said this trigger led to his suicide, and urged changes to the WCA
In April 2012, Colin Traynor, 29, died following a seizure, after months of growing anxiety about his finances and being wrongly found fit for work
Five months later, Labour’s Michael Meacher became one of the first MPs to speak in parliament about the controversial medical assessments
Sadly, Colin was not an isolated case, he said at the time
Dad Michael O’Sullivan, 60, of North London, took his life in September 2013, again after being found fit for work and ineligible for ESA
He had been claiming incapacity benefit since 2000, due to depression, social anxiety and agoraphobia
To read more content from our week-long series on Disabled Britain click here
In January 2014, coroner Mary Hassell linked his death to the WCA, warning of a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken.  The needless deaths continued. .
Jodey Whiting, 42, took her life in February 2017, after being told by the DWP she had been found fit for work
DWP’s assessors had noted the severity of her mental health ­condition, and the risk posed if she was found fit for work
Two years after her death, the DWP’s Independent Case Examiner found the department had failed five times to follow its safeguarding rules
Errol Graham’s body was discovered by bailiffs who had been sent to evict him in June 2018
He had starved to death, months after DWP wrongly stopped his ESA, and weighed 4st 7lb
In January 2020, Jodey and Errol, 57, were mentioned in the House of Commons with a demand by Labour’s Debbie Abrahams for an independent inquiry
Errol’s daughter-in-law Alison Burton said: It makes us angry and frustrated
You can’t put into words the devastation that department has caused
It just doesn’t seem to care
Debbie Abrahams, a former Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, said: I don’t want any more families like Jodey Whiting’s, Errol Graham’s and hundreds, possibly thousands, more to go through the pain that they have
I have been calling for a public inquiry into the scale and causes of the deaths of social security claimants from 2008 to date
Despite all of this, the ­Government has refused to listen
Claimants continue to lose their lives because of DWP failings
A ­disabled woman, who her family claims was traumatised by the daily demands of the universal credit system, took her life two months ago

We continually improve our services and have new teams to focus on our most vulnerable customers
The timeline, which is being published today in draft form before being launched officially later this year, is part of the Deaths by Welfare project headed by Dr China Mills and supported by Healing Justice Ldn (CORR), which works with marginalised and oppressed communities
Dr Mills has led the work on the timeline alongside John Pring, editor of Disability News Service, with key input from disabled activist Rick Burgess, disabled activist and author Ellen Clifford, welfare rights expert and researcher Nick Dilworth, and disabled artist-activist Dolly Sen
Dr Mills, Senior Lecturer in Public Health, said: We may never know the names of all of those who have died – the lives lived and lost
But we’re seeking people’s feedback, to remember those who have died and to reimagine welfare justice

But we’re seeking people’s feedback, to remember those who have died and to reimagine welfare justice

Indre Razutyte, from Pontefract, West Yorkshire, who was loved by everyone she met, was found dead in her garage on March 22, Wakefield Coroner's Court was told A mother who was loved by everyone she met took her own life at home, an inquest heard
Indre Razutyte, 31, was found unresponsive in her kitchen by her ex-partner on March 22
CPR was performed at the home in Pontefract, West Yorkshire, but Indre was declared dead
Suicide notes were found in the kitchen, Yorkshire Live reports
Indre leaves behind a two-year-old daughter
Wakefield Coroner's Court heard on Friday that Indre was much loved by her colleagues at small transport firm Centika Logistics
The mother was a transport manager there, and made such an impression on me immediately
Colleague Wayne Kearns, who joined the company in September last year, said: We're a small company, more like a family
Because of that I worked closely with Indre and we became good friends
She was like a little sister to me
She did used to sometimes talk about the issues she was facing, but it was such a shock to hear about her death and so heartbreaking
We'd spoken the day before when she was working from home
That day me and the manager had been messaging her because she hadn't come in
Losing Indre has felt like losing a member of the family
She was one of the nicest and kindest people I have ever met, she would help anybody
She was so nice, and I don't think she realised how lovely a person she was and how loved she was
I think she was worried about being left on her own
Indre's heartbroken family live in Lithuania, and are hoping to repatriate her home for a funeral there
Wayne and some of Indre's other colleagues have set up a GoFundMe page to help them pay for the costs of getting Indre home
As of April 8, the page is at £4,795
Any money left over from the fundraising will be put into a trust fund for Indre's two-year-old daughter
When we had drivers at the company who were having a bad day and would snap at anyone else, Indre was the only one who could calm them down
Customers would ask for her specifically
She could relate to anybody and I don't think she realised how great she was, Wayne added
She was really good at her job and just at talking to people
We always had a laugh in the office together
If she was feeling down I'd go to Morrisons and get us cake
Indre made such a big impact on me straight away
I wish I could've had the time to get to know her even better
The full inquest has been adjourned to a later date
Assistant coroner John Hobson did recount in brief the events that preceded Indre's death being recorded

We as a community grieve this loss
I do want to personally thank all who participated in the search efforts to include the fire departments and the many local residents who came to lend a hand
I want to express my sincere thanks to each and every one of you
I, as well as the community, extend our thoughts and prayers to the family for their loss
The Toga Volunteer Fire Department shared a link to a community prayer gathering being held in Landon's memory

It adds they also may try to escape overwhelming stimuli such as sights, sounds, surroundings, or activities of others

WARNING, DISTURBING CONTENT: Semina Halliwell took her own life after an interview with police and her distraught mum has raised concerns about how her daughter's rape allegation was handled A heartbroken mum who raised concerns about how police handled her daughter's rape allegation has shared a haunting final photo taken days before she took her own life
Semina Halliwell, 12, died after spending four nights in hospital days after a police interview where she was made to feel like an inconvenience
Her grieving mum Rachel wants everyone to see the harrowing last picture of her little girl taken just days before her death last year, the Liverpool Echo reports
The Year 7 pupil from Southport, Merseyside, told police she was raped by an older boy who she said had groomed her over Snapchat
Rachel has now released a photograph of Semina taken in hospital just days before she died, as she raised concerns over how the youngster was treated after coming forward
The parent said Merseyside Police officers investigating the alleged rape made Semina feel like an 'inconvenience' and has complained to the Independent Office for Police Conduct
Rachel reached out to police after Semina broke down and told her about the alleged rape following a severe incident of self-harm
She says she wants the image released today to act as a warning to others on the devastating impact bullying can have on others
Rachel said a detective started talking about all the forms he'd have to fill in and how long it would take him to fill those forms in
The mother's aunt Clare Halliwell says the detective then told Semina: It's your word against his and do you really want this hanging over your head for 18 months, because it wouldn't go to court for 18 months to two years
Rachel says she believes police failed her daughter
Merseyside Police today said it was not appropriate to comment on the issues raised ahead of a planned inquest into Semina's death
A spokesperson for the force said: The matter is currently being considered by the Sefton, Knowsley and St Helens coroner and as such it is not appropriate for Merseyside Police to comment on any of the substantive issues raised at this time, as we would not wish to prejudice the coronial investigation
However, we have, and are, co-operating fully with the coroner in this matter
A spokesperson for the coroners' office also said they were unable to comment on this or any case that is under investigation
The spokesperson added: The date of inquest will be published in due course
Semina's tragic case was raised at a parliamentary committee on June 23, 2021, when Labour MP Apsana Begum asked then-Education Secretary Gavin Williamson what more could be done to help protect children from sexual harassment and abuse
Ms Begum said: I wanted to highlight the case of Semina who was 12 years old who disclosed that she'd been raped, and has committed suicide last week
Following her death, Rachel feared Semina's bullies would gatecrash her funeral
Rachel had initially said everyone is invited to celebrate Semina's short life, but she later received some horrifying messages
Screenshots seen by the publication appeared to show someone who knew Semina telling Rachel they had been told they'd get battered at the funeral if they attended
The message continued: I'm scared to go

Police officers were in attendance at the funeral, which went ahead without incident
But less than three months later, Rachel was left devastated after the grave of her 12-year-old daughter was trashed by yobs
In September, a family friend found Semina's grave had been completely desecrated
Rachel told the ECHO: It was covered in bricks and rocks and there was dog mess all over it
It was clearly done on purpose
At the time, Community Inspector Graham Fisher said the force and the community shared the family's shock and revulsion over the desecration of Semina's grave
He said This is the final resting place of a beloved family member, and I can only imagine how upsetting it must have been for their loved ones to find that the grave had been treated in this way
While thankfully no permanent damage has been caused, it will have caused lasting distress to the family
Merseyside Police today confirmed no charges or arrests have been made in relation to the attack on Semina's grave

An inquest has heard how Bailey Reay, 13, sent a heartbreaking 'final goodbye' voice-note to his crush, before being found unresponsive at his grandmother's home A 13-year-old schoolboy sent a heartbreaking final 'last goodbye' message to a girl he fancied before his tragic death, an inquest has heard
Bailey Reay, from Sunderland, was found unresponsive at his grandmother's home where he lived on 19 December 2020
Emergency services were immediately called, but he was tragically pronounced dead - leaving his family and friends devastated, report Chronicle Live
An inquest - held at City Hall on Wednesday - heard how Bailey resided with his grandmother
On December 18, he was left in the care of his grandmother's aunt and they spent some time together eating pizza
It was also heard how Bailey also spent some time in his room playing on his PlayStation
But, by midday on December 19, Bailey was found unresponsive and the emergency services were called but he tragically passed away
The teenager was found in his room with an empty bottle of medication that was originally prescribed to his grandmother
A post-mortem was carried out and toxicology was taken and it was found that Bailey had alcohol and medication, which was eight times a large therapeutic dose, in his system
The pathologist found that Bailey died as a result of the effects of the medication and alcohol which it was heard can impact the central nervous system
The inquest heard there were a number of things that caused Bailey concern including difficult family dynamics and school though recent records suggested he had got back into school and that it seemed to be going well
Following Bailey's death, some concerns were raised over the issue of bullying and police seized his computer and mobile phone which was protected by a pin
However, the inquest heard that nothing specific was identified
However, they did find a voicemail that Bailey had left a girl who he had a crush on which said: I have had a crush on you for the longest time so I guess this is goodbye
Assistant coroner, Karin Welsh, said Bailey had admitted taking medication in the voicemail he left to his crush and recorded a verdict of suicide
She told his family: Why doesn't fall within the remit of an inquest
There were a number of factors in Bailey's life that must have been causing him concern

Child poverty charity The Childhood Trust today revealed how children have been impacted by the ongoing cost of living crisis - being left having self-harming and suicidal thoughts due to money worries Children are having suicidal thoughts because of the cost of living crisis, a report found
Britain is facing a ­humanitarian crisis on our doorsteps with children self-harming and unable to sleep because of money worries
Child poverty charity The Childhood Trust has today released a 33-page report into the effect the crisis is having on disadvantaged youngsters
They are warning millions of children are at breaking point
One little girl said she watches telly to try to forget her hunger
Laura, seven, of London, said: I ask my mother if we’ve any food and she’ll tell me if there’s enough money
If there isn’t then I just go in the cupboards and see if there’s something
If there’s a snack, I’ll eat it and try to go to bed
Tomorrow she might have more money
Another girl said: My mum was trying to pay for the electricity and we didn’t really have enough.  I felt really sad
It was really cold and I was really scared because the heater wasn’t working
The research by the Childhood Trust involved 1,468 parents, some to people aged over 18, with a third saying their children had been affected by the crisis
Of these 483 parents, nearly half said their kids are stressed, and a fifth said they smile less now
Nearly one in 10 reported children who have started self-harming while 8% said their kids have displayed suicidal tendencies
The Childhood Trust is aiming to raise £3
5million to help ­those in need
Chief executive Laurence ­Guinness said: It’s only thanks to donors and the thousands of ­charities supporting children that we aren’t facing a humanitarian crisis on our own doorsteps.  Donate at: championsforchildren. childhoodtrust. org

Why he ended up in the Devon seafront hotel where Agatha Christie spent her wedding night and why he apparently ended his life there has never been established A chilling death that was compared to an Agatha Christie novel remains unsolved twenty-five years later
The man was found dead in a seafront hotel room in Torquay, Devon - the same town where the thriller writer was born
Mr Patel was found dead at the Grand Hotel and, next to his naked body, there was a glass of Coke which contained the poison cyanide
It turned out the room had been booked under a false name, with Mr Patel giving a fake home address in London
Mr Patel checked into the landmark hotel in September 1997 after having stayed for three days in the modest Lee's Hotel and Cantonese Restaurant, reports DevonLive
The mystery guest, in his mid-thirties, ordered room service and ate a meal of roast lamb, washed down with a glass of Frascati, an Italian white wine
His body was found by a chambermaid the next day, on the 24
His black suit, white shirt and multi-coloured tie were neatly folded on his bed, and on the bedside table was £94
12 in cash and an empty wine glass
But when the authorities were called in and tried to identify him, the lines of inquiry carried out the investigators found a series of dead ends
It was only due to a coincidence that a tantalising clue emerged
Two marks were seen on his shoulder, a sign that he was a member of the Tamil Tigers, a rebel group in Sri Lanka, an island state in the Indian Ocean
But why he ended up in the Devon seafront hotel where Agatha Christie spent her wedding night, and why he apparently ended his life there, has never been established
What did your local area use to look like? Find out with InYourArea's tool which takes you on a trip down Memory Lane
When the body was removed to the mortuary, coroner’s officer Robin Little spotted the marks on Mr Patel’s shoulder
The then South Devon coroner Hamish Turner later recalled: We spent a year trying to find out who this chap was
We even photographed his face and sent that photo around the country hoping someone would recognise him, but had no luck
It was perhaps a grim thing to do – but we had nothing else to go on because he carried nothing to identify himself
It was a lucky coincidence that the local forensic pathologist, Dr Guyan Fernando, is from Sri Lanka
He was told of these marks in a chance conversation with Mr Little and was able to tell us that the dead man must be from his country because these marks were the tribal sign of the Tamil Tigers, a rebel group in Sri Lanka

The cyanide was another clue that the dead man was a Tamil Tiger because, Mr Fernando said, they always carried a cyanide pill with them in case they were caught
Then there was a courteous note, penned by Mr Patel
It read: I am very sorry for what I have done here but this is the place I had to carry out the deed
To the chef, the food was magnificent – fit for the gods – for a final meal.  Thank you
Mr Turner said: I could only remark at the inquest that his reference to this place might be because he had read some Agatha Christie story and knew of her connection with the Grand Hotel
The dead man’s clothing was examined for clues to his identity but there were no laundry tags or marks that might help
He had a rather nice Parker pen which might have suggested he was an educated man, Mr Turner added, but despite months of investigation by the police we never discovered his real name or what he was doing in Torquay
It was, he added, the most baffling case of his career, and he could only now surmise that the dead man must have been running away from someone he feared, which was why he chose to end his life when he did
As to exactly why he died, and whether he was a devotee of Agatha Christie, I suppose we will never know

But when the authorities were called in and tried to identify him, the lines of inquiry carried out the investigators found a series of dead ends
It was only due to a coincidence that a tantalising clue emerged
Two marks were seen on his shoulder, a sign that he was a member of the Tamil Tigers, a rebel group in Sri Lanka, an island state in the Indian Ocean
But why he ended up in the Devon seafront hotel where Agatha Christie spent her wedding night, and why he apparently ended his life there, has never been established

When the body was removed to the mortuary, coroner’s officer Robin Little spotted the marks on Mr Patel’s shoulder
The then South Devon coroner Hamish Turner later recalled: We spent a year trying to find out who this chap was
We even photographed his face and sent that photo around the country hoping someone would recognise him, but had no luck
It was perhaps a grim thing to do – but we had nothing else to go on because he carried nothing to identify himself
It was a lucky coincidence that the local forensic pathologist, Dr Guyan Fernando, is from Sri Lanka
He was told of these marks in a chance conversation with Mr Little and was able to tell us that the dead man must be from his country because these marks were the tribal sign of the Tamil Tigers, a rebel group in Sri Lanka

The cyanide was another clue that the dead man was a Tamil Tiger because, Mr Fernando said, they always carried a cyanide pill with them in case they were caught
Then there was a courteous note, penned by Mr Patel
It read: I am very sorry for what I have done here but this is the place I had to carry out the deed
To the chef, the food was magnificent – fit for the gods – for a final meal.  Thank you
Mr Turner said: I could only remark at the inquest that his reference to this place might be because he had read some Agatha Christie story and knew of her connection with the Grand Hotel
The dead man’s clothing was examined for clues to his identity but there were no laundry tags or marks that might help
He had a rather nice Parker pen which might have suggested he was an educated man, Mr Turner added, but despite months of investigation by the police we never discovered his real name or what he was doing in Torquay
It was, he added, the most baffling case of his career, and he could only now surmise that the dead man must have been running away from someone he feared, which was why he chose to end his life when he did
As to exactly why he died, and whether he was a devotee of Agatha Christie, I suppose we will never know

Violent Daniel Boulton is on trial accused of murdering former girlfriend Bethany Vincent and her nine-year-old autistic son, Darren Henson, before leading Lincolnshire Police on a 24-hour manhunt A violent ex-partner brutally stabbed a mum and her young autistic son to death before leading police on a 24-hour manhunt, a court has heard
Daniel Boulton is alleged to have knifed his former girlfriend Bethany Vincent and her nine-year-old son Darren Henson, also known as DJ, numerous times while the subject of a restraining order on May 31 last year
Boulton developed a hatred for Darren before the killings, Lincoln Crown Court was told
A nine-month-old child was seen crawling around the house when emergency services arrived at the property in High Holme Road in Louth, Lincolnshire, the court heard, with the defendant later leaving a note saying: I, Daniel Boulton, take full responsibility for 182
The relationship between Boulton and Ms Vincent had deteriorated by the end of March 2019 and he was eventually ordered not to contact his ex-partner, jurors were told
Boulton led Lincolnshire Police on a manhunt until the following day, when he allegedly stabbed an off-duty police officer in the leg in the Hubbards Hills area of Louth before being arrested on a nearby farm
Prosecutors said there was no dispute Boulton stabbed both victims, with him denying the alleged offences because his ability to exercise self-control had been impaired
Opening the case against Boulton on Thursday, prosecutor Katherine Goddard QC said: At around 8pm on the evening of May 31 last year, a young woman and her nine-year-old son were brutally stabbed to death in their own home in Louth
There is no dispute that the person who stabbed both victims was this defendant, Daniel Boulton
Mr Boulton's case will be that, although he physically carried out the stabbings of the two victims, he was, at the time, suffering from a recognised mental condition which substantially impaired his ability to form a rational judgement and exercise self-control
Addressing the history between Boulton and Ms Vincent, Ms Goddard said: The relationship between Bethany and the defendant began in about March 2019 and, like most relationships, at the start everything was good.  Everybody appeared happy
But, by the end of that year, it had deteriorated and was marked by, the prosecution say, increasing violence from Mr Boulton towards Bethany and, later, towards her parents
Bethany made a complaint to the police about Mr Boulton and the violence and behaviour towards her, and Mr Boulton was made the subject of a restraining order precluding him from contacting her
A further restraining order was made after yet another incident in February 2021 but, despite both those orders, Mr Boulton continued to contact Bethany - by telephone, by text message, by social media messages, and by unannounced and uninvited visits to her home
None of that contact was sought by Bethany and, in fact, only a few days after her and DJ were stabbed to death, they were due to move to a new house - to an address unknown to Mr Boulton
Ms Goddard continued: Social services became involved with Bethany and her family after her first complaint to the police of domestic violence in November 2020
Their concerns related only to the risk Mr Boulton presented to the family
He had, by then, expressed a hatred of DJ, a nine-year-old boy. .
who had been diagnosed with autism
He was seen running from an alleyway leading to the back of number 182
He seemed flushed, agitated, and called out to the witnesses to call an ambulance as someone had been stabbed inside
He then casually walked away, not waiting for the emergency services to arrive
Explaining what emergency services saw when they entered the house, Ms Goddard said: In the downstairs front room, they found Bethany lying on her side, half curled into a ball, clearly already dead
Upstairs, they found DJ, lying on his side alongside his bed, also clearly dead
Both appeared to have been stabbed numerous times and, in addition to obvious stab wounds, they had marks consistent with blunt force trauma - being hit by something
Ms Goddard said a nine-month-old child had also been found at the property, untouched and unharmed but clearly distressed and crawling through the house
After allegedly making his escape, Boulton was said to have broken into a bungalow
The following day he ran into a police officer who he allegedly stabbed in the leg after a short confrontation
He tried to flee but police flooded the area after the stabbed cop called them in
Boulton, of Alexandra Road, Skegness, denies murdering Ms Vincent and her son, assault with intent to resist arrest, and burglary.  The trial continues

Suzanne Drinkwater woke up in summer last year to find her boyfriend dead in the bed beside her and she decided to take her own life- the couple's bodies would eventually be found there A woman tragically killed herself after waking up to find her boyfriend dead in their bed beside her
Suzanne Drinkwater woke up one morning in the summer last year and was horrified when she found her boyfriend 35-year-old Gavin Massey, was dead next to her
The heartbroken 32-year-old from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, took her own life that morning in the very same bed
When the couple were finally found after police bashed down their front door, one of the bodies was decomposing
She had been receiving help for a number of psychiatric conditions at the time of her death, the inquest into their deaths heard
Coroner Tom Osborne, sitting at Milton Keynes, heard how Gavin likely died from cardiomegaly, an enlarged heart, and left ventricular hypertrophy, worsened by the steroids he had been taking
His death was also exacerbated by a mixture of alcohol and drugs found in his system
The alarm was raised after Suzanne’s sister had been unable to contact her from August 4, and on August 7, she raised her fears with police
One day after that, they discovered the couple dead after police were forced to break into their home
There was no criticism of the agencies which had been helping both patients, during the joint inquest

Charlie Bowe, 12, who is autistic, was finally offered a place at a special school but has no transport to get there, forcing his mum to give up her job to drive him A 12-year-old autistic boy who spent six months out of school is struggling to find transport to take him to his new special school, forcing his mum to quit her job to drive him
Charlie Bowe was forced to quit his mainstream secondary school, a few weeks after enrolling as a Year 7 student, because staff couldn't meet his needs
Whilst he technically remained on roll for several months afterwards, his final lesson was in October, and he had no work allocated to him at home
His mother, Samantha Bowe, aged 32, told Stoke on Trent Live that it was affecting his mental health and he was really upset
After lodging a special needs tribunal, she was relieved to be offered a place at Abbey Hill School in Meir, where Charlie started last week
She commented: It’s the best place for him
But Samantha has been forced to relinquish her job in order to drive Charlie from their home in Trentham every day, to the school four miles away
Stoke-on-Trent City Council have refused to provide school transport
Instead, officials gave the family a personal budget of £15
38 a day to arrange taxis themselves
Samantha said: I started ringing round taxi services and they were all saying they couldn’t take him
Either they didn’t do school runs, they were fully booked or they said he was too young to take without a chaperone
Even if they could have taken him, I was getting quotes off some of them of £50 a day
Samantha found another Abbey Hill pupil, who lives in the Staffordshire County Council area, and qualifies for a minibus to travel to school and through Trentham
However, this transport is arranged via a separate local authority and there was no spare seat
Samantha has to drop off seven-year-old son Mason at Ash Green Primary Academy, in Trentham, before taking Charlie to school
But's he's now regularly arriving late for lessons at Abbey Hill, with his mum adding: It’s taking me an hour on the school run in the morning and an hour in the afternoon
Samantha’s boss at a cookware shop even contacted the council on her behalf
She said: The local authority just said my boss needed to be a bit flexible
It made us laugh as you can’t be flexible in retail
We are only a small staff
Although the job is still available if she can sort out the school transport, Samantha is currently out of work
Whilst appealing the council's transport decision, she has had to turn down the personal budget, so is funding fuel costs herself
It is just the latest in a series of battles to ensure Charlie gets the support he needs
As well as autism, he has learning difficulties and has the reading age of a six-year-old
We waited three years for his autism assessment
He finally got it this year, said Samantha
She says it also took three attempts to get an education, health and care plan

Luna Munoz from Liverpool, Merseyside, said she was forced to go home, instead of flying to see her family for the first time in years, after the ordeal at Manchester Airport A distraught mum claims she was forced to cancel family holiday after autistic son suffered a panic attack while being searched by security at UK airport
Luna Muñoz and her son Eli, 15, were due to fly from Manchester to Boston, Massachusetts, to visit family they have not seen for three years
Eli had been given a sunflower lanyard to alert staff that he had special needs, but when he triggered the metal detector in security he had to be hand-searched
Speaking to Manchester Evening News, Luna claims Eli started to grimace and cry while being searched, before running away in distress and having a panic attack
She said: I had to excuse myself to the bathroom to just cry
I didn’t want Eli to see that
I thought, I don't think we’re going to be protected or safe beyond this point
It was a holiday they had been looking forward to for years, but Luna said she couldn’t face the possibility of further distress for Eli, and so cancelled the family's trip and returned home to Liverpool, Merseyside
Luna said: We haven’t seen family in three years now, and this was our chance
It has been a long, long time
It was a hard choice
But we talked about it as a family and thought no, it’s not worth it
The mum claims she made enquiries about special assistance for Eli before setting off on Wednesday (June 1)
She claims his special needs entitlement included giving Eli more time to process instructions, such as at security, and finding ways in which Eli would be comfortable to be searched
Luna said she tried to speak to security staff about carrying out the search in a way Eli would find manageable, but her son had already been touched on the back and shoulder
The mum added that this was intimate touching and claims Eli had already started to show distress
Luna said: I don’t even hug my child unless I have consent. .
and it’s been a while
I understand this person has to do their job
But touching someone on their shoulders or their back is intimate touching, that’s not touching to do their jobs
She added: They were trying to be reassuring, but for a person with special needs, that’s not reassuring
You don’t expect special treatment, but there is a way to do it
You do expect a little more in terms of time and patience
A spokesperson for Manchester Airport said they are satisfied that their staff did what they could to reassure Eli and Luna in this instance
Airport staff also maintain that Eli's visible lanyard was taken into consideration during the incident
A Manchester Airport spokesperson said: The security of our passengers and staff is of paramount importance and our security process must be applied consistently
In this case, the passenger activated a walk-through metal detector and so a hand search was necessary, in line with security regulations
Our security team explained to the passenger and his mother why this was necessary prior to conducting the search
Security colleagues are trained in how to engage with passengers who have hidden disabilities such as autism and we are satisfied that they did their best to reassure the passengers concerned in this instance
We are, however, sorry to hear they found the experience distressing and would welcome any feedback from Ms Munoz on how she feels the process could be improved

Laura Jordan, from Redditch, Worcs, said her son Zac has fallen behind during the seven months he has spent at home following his expulsion - and he still cannot read or even write his own name A five-year-old boy expelled for bad behaviour will have spent a year at home before he fully returns to school
Little Zac was just four-years-old when he was booted out of his school in October over behavioural issues
Mum Laura, 36, told the council her son had undiagnosed special educational needs and resisted attempts to send him to another mainstream school
The 36-year-old, from Redditch, Worcs, slammed Worcestershire County Council for failing to find Zac a place at a special needs school following his expulsion
She has even accused the council of breaking the law after Zac reached compulsory school age and was still stuck at home
However, Zac has now finally been offered a place at a new autism unit at Chaddesley Corbett school in Kidderminster
Laura told The Mirror: The council have now offered Zac a school place and we will start the slow process of reintegration after the next half term, with an aim to start full time in September
Although Laura is pleased that Zac is finally returning to the classroom, she voiced concerns that her son will have missed out on almost a year of full-time education
She said: September is a long time away.  He’s fallen behind
He can’t read or write at the moment
He should know how to write his name and he should be starting to read
His name is only three letters and he can’t write that.  It’s sad
It’s affecting his development massively
Socially he’s not where he should be at
He’s going to find it harder to socialise with children now
Laura previously said her son had spent so much time in the house that he was scared to go outside
Just days before receiving the news about Zac’s place, Laura told The Mirror that Worcestershire County Council had broken the law by missing the deadline to get her son back into school
She said: The law states that the term after their fifth birthday they should be in education
Jack turned five in February so on April 26 he should’ve been back in school as that’s when the kids went back after Easter.  It’s so frustrating
They have had since October to sort this out
Worcestershire County Council has broken the law now
If as a parent I didn’t send my son to school when they turned five I would be taken to court - or they would want to know why he wasn’t in school
Zac was expelled from Holly Hill Church School, in Rubery, Worcs, within five weeks of joining reception class
He was booted out over a number of behaviour problems, including attacks on other pupils and staff
Laura explained that her life has been on hold for the past seven months while looking after Zac at home
She has not been able to work because she does not have anyone around who is able to watch him
Although she has tried to teach him at home, Zac quickly loses interest
Laura is speaking out to raise awareness about the difficulties in accessing proper education for children with special needs
She said parents face a postcode lottery as councils have different policies for special educational needs
The mum claimed that while Birmingham City Council would have offered her son alternative education immediately after his expulsion, this was not an option in Worcestershire

Laura previously said she thought the UK's compulsory school age should be lowered to four-years-old to ensure children stay in education once they start school
Worcestershire councillor Marcus Hart, cabinet member for education, said: We are pleased to be able to confirm that a suitable place has been identified for Zac at Chaddesley Corbett Primary School
Zac will start school after the half term in June with an appropriate package of support to help him transition back into education
We acknowledge the delay in finding a suitable placement to meet Zac’s needs and apologise for the frustrations that this process has caused to both Zac and his family
We would like to wish him every success in his new school and his wider educational journey
Mr Hart previously acknowledged that the law required all children to start full-time education by the beginning of the term following their fifth birthday
In March, he told The Mirror that he hoped to have Zac ready to start school in April
A Department for Education spokesperson previously said: Suspensions and permanent exclusions should only be used as a last resort, but we back headteachers to suspend or exclude pupils where it is necessary and helps maintain calm classrooms
We are consulting on changes to behaviour and exclusions guidance to make sure this is used in a fair way, and the cross-government SEND Review will further consult on how children with special educational needs and disabilities are supported by the system, including in alternative provision
Get email updates with the day's biggest stories Laura Jordan, from Redditch, Worcs, said her son Zac has fallen behind during the seven months he has spent at home following his expulsion - and he still cannot read or even write his own name A five-year-old boy expelled for bad behaviour will have spent a year at home before he fully returns to school
Little Zac was just four-years-old when he was booted out of his school in October over behavioural issues
Mum Laura, 36, told the council her son had undiagnosed special educational needs and resisted attempts to send him to another mainstream school
The 36-year-old, from Redditch, Worcs, slammed Worcestershire County Council for failing to find Zac a place at a special needs school following his expulsion
She has even accused the council of breaking the law after Zac reached compulsory school age and was still stuck at home
However, Zac has now finally been offered a place at a new autism unit at Chaddesley Corbett school in Kidderminster
Laura told The Mirror: The council have now offered Zac a school place and we will start the slow process of reintegration after the next half term, with an aim to start full time in September
Although Laura is pleased that Zac is finally returning to the classroom, she voiced concerns that her son will have missed out on almost a year of full-time education
She said: September is a long time away.  He’s fallen behind
He can’t read or write at the moment
He should know how to write his name and he should be starting to read
His name is only three letters and he can’t write that.  It’s sad
It’s affecting his development massively
Socially he’s not where he should be at
He’s going to find it harder to socialise with children now
Laura previously said her son had spent so much time in the house that he was scared to go outside

Medic Abhijeet Tavare, who joined the world-famous McKinsey management company after graduating, was found by his friends who went looking for him on the middle of the night An Oxford University -trained doctor whose life was shattered when he caught long Covid took his own life because he could not cope with the illness anymore, an inquest heard on Wednesday
The high-flying medic, who joined the world-famous McKinsey management company after graduating, was found by his doctor friends who went looking for him on the middle of the night
A coroner heard that 27-year-old Abhijeet Tavare's mother had returned to their home on London Road, Bushey, Herts, after her usual morning walk, only to realise something was wrong
She went into her son's bedroom and found his suicide notes
In a statement from Abhijeet's GP which was read to the inquest, it was revealed that the son, known as Abhi to friends, had contracted Covid- in September 2020, which he initially recovered from, only for symptoms of long Covid to emerge
The inquest in Hertford was told that he reported he was suffering from palpitations, difficulty sleeping, extreme fatigue, as well as cognitive decline caused by brain fog
The latter meant he could no longer work for the international management consulting company and moved back home with his mother
He had already seen five different doctors and therapists for his physical and mental health issues, all to no avail
He was prescribed sleep medication by his GP and it was recorded in the inquest that no mention of self-harm or suicidal ideation was reported
A statement from police constable Holly Edwards, read: Police received a phone call from Abhijeet's sister-in-law, saying he wasn't in his room and had left notes, saying he could no longer live with his illness and didn't want to suffer anymore
His mum woke up and went for a walk
She got back and noticed he hadn't left his bedroom
She opened his door and he wasn't there
Then she found the letters and immediately called his sister-in-law, who then called police
Officers declared him a high-risk missing person and began a search after finding CCTV of where the car he was driving was last spotted
Meanwhile, his closest friends - all junior doctors - heard the news he was missing and formed a search party
Get the stories you want straight to your inbox
Sign up to one of the Mirror's newsletters The inquest was told that a combination of police investigations and reports, as well as the friends' use of iPhone tracking and bank transaction tracking, led them to an area where he was last believed to have been
His brother, Aniket Tavare said: He was my younger brother
He was a very happy and well-adjusted child
Our dad passed away when he was six years old
He was very sporty and he never let life get in his way
When Covid struck, he stayed with my mum and worked from home
He felt fine for a little bit, but then he started rapidly declining
He was extremely frustrated by this
When I last saw him he was very different - we couldn't really talk about anything as his life was on pause
There were no specific mental health concerns - we knew he was down, but that was more for his circumstances
I thought he would ride it out like every other challenge he faced in life
He will be missed by a lot of people
Concluding the inquest, assistant Hertfordshire coroner Jonathan Stevens said: Abhi Tavare was an extremely talented man
He had been to Oxford University and had excelled
He had a very tight-knit group of friends
He was due to be best man at one of their weddings in the following year
He was an exceptionally talented person
He contracted long Covid and that presented him with a dramatic change to his life
He had seen numerous consultants to no avail
Once he was declared missing, the response from his friends was quite overwhelming
He recorded the death as suicide

Residents living above Faith in Strangers in Margate, Kent, were unaware that the venue would eventually become a live music venue on weekend evenings, they claim The parents of a two-year-old autistic boy have claimed they have been forced to move out of their apartment due to the nightclub below blasting loud music into the early hours
Residents living above Faith in Strangers in Margate, Kent, were unaware that the venue, which was originally a creative co-working space that hosted poetry nights and academic talks, would eventually become a live music venue on weekend evenings
But after lockdown, residents of the block of 12 flats above the venue have claimed weekends have become a nightmare with bosses having revealed that it could become a live music venue on Fridays and Saturdays
And a mum-of-two, Rosie-Mae Deal, told how she has been brought to tears by the ridiculously loud music that was causing a huge amount of distress to her autistic son
One night I sat crying in my home knowing I can’t do anything about this ridiculously loud music thumping through my flat, waking my children up, upsetting my little boy, who has autism so is very sensitive to sounds, she said
He sleeps in my bed because he’s scared
He covers his ears, he cries, he screams under his covers
Rosie-Mae said the family should be able to feel safe and at peace in their own home
Another elderly resident, Ethelbert Crescent, has suggested the noise is bad due to it not having the correct soundproofing to manage the loud music
Ethelbert, who is in her 80s, explained that the blaring noise is affecting her health and had prompted her to avoid staying in her own home
When Georgina Powell and her partner moved into an apartment in the same block of flats, , they had been drawn to the idea of the arts hub that they could use on their doorstep
Georgina said that the concept of the space had sounded amazing
But now, she and her partner - whose flat is directly above the venue - have now been forced to move out, and are now paying rent on top of their mortgage
Georgina compared parties held in the flat to the noise held in Fabric nightclub, with the floor vibrating and the couple able to hear every word to Madonna
Various noise complaints were logged by the Thanet District Council last year, prompting an application to review the licence to be submitted
According to the council's environment and health team, the venue has not always adhered to their 11pm noise curfew

More measures were potentially necessary not to disturb the neighbours
However, 130 letters of support have reportedly been sent in favour of the venue, which some locals have called key to the community in the area
Representatives from eight of the 12 flats appealing to the council will appear in a council hearing due to take place on Thursday
Faith in Strangers has been unable to comment until a ruling is decided

Gaia Pope-Sutherland's was worried about the imminent release from prison of a man she had accused of raping her and her mental health was suffering, an inquest heard A missing teenager had feared she was pregnant days before her death, an inquest heard today
Gaia Pope-Sutherland, 19, was reported missing from her home in Swanage, Dorset on November 7, 2017
Her body was found 11 days later in the undergrowth
Dorset Coroner's Court heard that Gaia's mental health was suffering due to worries about the imminent release from prison of a man she had accused of raping her
She had also recently split up with her boyfriend and had been sent indecent images on social media, the inquest heard
Gaia, who suffered from severe epilepsy and post-traumatic stress disorder, had been experiencing ongoing manic episodes in the weeks before her disappearance, it was said
Forensic pathologist Dr Russell Delaney told the hearing her naked body was found in deep undergrowth and that she had died from hypothermia
Gaia's clothing was found scattered across a field as if she had been removing it as she walked
Dr Delaney said told the hearing at the time of her disappearance she had recently split from her boyfriend and had become convinced she was pregnant, even though a test was negative
He said there was no medical evidence she was pregnant at the time of her death
Gaia had been due to see the GP for an appointment at 5pm the day she vanished
Dr Delaney said the day she disappeared the teen left her aunt's home at about 3
40pm and went to a friend's where she was behaving irrationally and began undressing
Gaia redressed but left without her coat, and the last known sighting of her was a few minutes later
Dr Delaney said the post-mortem examination found no signs of trauma, but there was evidence of Wischnewski spots in the lining of her stomach - a sign of hypothermia
The pathologist said there were several possibilities why Gaia had undressed before her death
It is possible Gaia was suffering from paradoxical undressing - where she thought she was overheating and removed her clothing
Another possibility could have been her declining mental health
He said: It is possible she was undressed because of her deteriorating mental health and that has made her vulnerable to hypothermia
The deterioration of her mental health has led to her being outside, and cold and wet, and led to her becoming more confused with hypothermia
The undressing is typical of paradoxical undressing and hypothermia
She also had minor cuts to her feet and shins, consistent with walking through gorse and brambles while not wearing shoes or socks
Dr Delaney described a condition called hide and die where someone suffering from hypothermia burrows into a closed space
Gaia, who used cannabis and ecstasy, was prescribed medication to treat up to five seizures a day, but Dr Delaney could not be sure she had suffered one before her death
He said: I am certain that hypothermia has made a significant contribution to her death
It is significant to explain her death alone
It could have acted in concert with epilepsy
In the absence of anyone witnessing the seizure, there isn't a way of determining to a significant degree of certainty that someone has had a seizure immediately prior to death
Dr Delaney said he believed Gaia had died a number of days before her body was found but was unable to say exactly when
He said: I would always urge caution by trying to be too specific and narrow the time frame down too much
Research entomologist Martin Hall has previously told the inquest that having examined blowfly larvae recovered from the teenager's body he believed the latest she was alive was November 9

Luna Munoz from Liverpool, Merseyside, said she was forced to go home, instead of flying to see her family for the first time in years, after the ordeal at Manchester Airport A distraught mum claims she was forced to cancel family holiday after autistic son suffered a panic attack while being searched by security at UK airport
Luna Muñoz and her son Eli, 15, were due to fly from Manchester to Boston, Massachusetts, to visit family they have not seen for three years
Eli had been given a sunflower lanyard to alert staff that he had special needs, but when he triggered the metal detector in security he had to be hand-searched
Speaking to Manchester Evening News, Luna claims Eli started to grimace and cry while being searched, before running away in distress and having a panic attack
She said: I had to excuse myself to the bathroom to just cry
I didn’t want Eli to see that
I thought, I don't think we’re going to be protected or safe beyond this point
It was a holiday they had been looking forward to for years, but Luna said she couldn’t face the possibility of further distress for Eli, and so cancelled the family's trip and returned home to Liverpool, Merseyside
Luna said: We haven’t seen family in three years now, and this was our chance
It has been a long, long time
It was a hard choice
But we talked about it as a family and thought no, it’s not worth it
The mum claims she made enquiries about special assistance for Eli before setting off on Wednesday (June 1)
She claims his special needs entitlement included giving Eli more time to process instructions, such as at security, and finding ways in which Eli would be comfortable to be searched
Luna said she tried to speak to security staff about carrying out the search in a way Eli would find manageable, but her son had already been touched on the back and shoulder
The mum added that this was intimate touching and claims Eli had already started to show distress
Luna said: I don’t even hug my child unless I have consent. .
and it’s been a while
I understand this person has to do their job
But touching someone on their shoulders or their back is intimate touching, that’s not touching to do their jobs
She added: They were trying to be reassuring, but for a person with special needs, that’s not reassuring
You don’t expect special treatment, but there is a way to do it
You do expect a little more in terms of time and patience
A spokesperson for Manchester Airport said they are satisfied that their staff did what they could to reassure Eli and Luna in this instance
Airport staff also maintain that Eli's visible lanyard was taken into consideration during the incident
A Manchester Airport spokesperson said: The security of our passengers and staff is of paramount importance and our security process must be applied consistently
In this case, the passenger activated a walk-through metal detector and so a hand search was necessary, in line with security regulations
Our security team explained to the passenger and his mother why this was necessary prior to conducting the search
Security colleagues are trained in how to engage with passengers who have hidden disabilities such as autism and we are satisfied that they did their best to reassure the passengers concerned in this instance
We are, however, sorry to hear they found the experience distressing and would welcome any feedback from Ms Munoz on how she feels the process could be improved

Robert Needham, 42, killed his wife Kelly Fitzgibbons, 40, and his two daughters, Ava, four, Lexi, two, and their dog at their £600,000 home before taking his own life in March 2020 A distraught uncle has described his moment of terror when he found his niece and her daughters slaughtered by her husband
Robert Needham, 42, killed his wife Kelly Fitzgibbons, 40, and his two daughters, Ava, four, Lexi, two, and their dog at their £600,000 home before taking his own life
The tragedy happened in the quiet village of Woodmancote in West Sussex just a week into lockdown in March 2020
Kelly’s uncle, Ronald Peacock, told an inquest in Horsham, West Sussex, on Tuesday about the moment he found their bodies after climbing through an open window into the couple's bedroom
Mr Peacock added: I realised I could see Ava’s head on the bed, under the duvet
Both girls laying side by side in the bed
I could see Kelly on the floor, near the door
Rob was on the floor in the hallway
I climbed through the window
The TV was on and I could see blood on the pillows
I could tell they were both dead.  Kelly was dead
It was obvious from the position and the amount of blood there was nothing I could do for her
He also said he found Needham lying in the hallway with the shotgun pointed at his head.  He then called 999
The Sun reports he said: I could feel the cold on the back of my head
Kelly was cold, Ava was cold and Lexi too was cold
The inquest was also told Needham was a secret cocaine user and, in the days leading up to the tragedy, had tried to get hold of the drug from a supplier without success
The inquest heard toxicology tests also showed he had not taken any cocaine at the time of the tragedy, but a hair sample test showed he had been a cocaine user
It was also said that in the past he had been forced to see a doctor over the damage the drug had caused to his nose
It was also said Needham had been suffering financial problems in the run-up to the Covid lockdown in March 2020
The family had earlier moved into his family home to help care for his mother, Maureen, 77, after his father Rex, who suffered from Parkinson's disease, died in 2017
They lived upstairs rent-free while his mother lived in a granny flat downstairs
He was building an extension to the house but the family had run into financial problems and had stopped contributing to the bills
The builder had also been forced to take out a loan of £20,000 from his mother to cover his family's day-to-day living
When Covid struck, Needham found it difficult getting hold of building supplies and had to put the work extension on hold, it was said
In a statement to the hearing, Kelly's twin sister, Emma Ambler, said she did not believe the couple had any serious money worries
The inquest heard how Needham had a history of mental illness and an official caution for theft but omitted it when applying for a firearms licence in 2016
He was issued with a firearms licence despite admitting the lies to a police officer, a coroner was told
He then used the certificate to buy a semi-automatic shotgun shortly before killing his family
Needham declared on the application he had never had a criminal conviction and had no history of mental health problems
However, he had previously suffered at least two bouts of mental health problems in 2003 and 2013 and had been treated for depression, it was said
He had also previously been issued with a caution from police for stealing a bicycle going back many years
At the time of his application, a firearms enquiry officer from Hampshire Police questioned Needham at this home, the inquest heard
When Needham was told his GP would be contacted in relation to the application he then told the cop about his mental health problems and admitted having a criminal conviction
The hearing was told he told the officer he did not think they were relevant because they were a long time ago
Chief Inspector Nigel Lecointe of Hampshire said he would have expected greater scrutiny of the application
He said the omissions should have been a cause for concern and raised a red flag
Guidance for firearms licensing in 2016 stated: Whether the applicant is found to have made a false statement is of particular relevance
Deliberate failure to declare relevant convictions, medical conditions or medical history tends to show unfitness regardless of whether the certificate would have been refused if the appropriate declaration had been made
The firearms licence was approved by Sussex Police after Needham and the family moved to the county
The hearing was told Hampshire Police was minded to grant the firearms certificate but Mr Needham moved home and the decision to grant final approval was transferred to the Sussex force
Firearms licences are valid for five years
Mr Lecointe told the court: We should never be complacent about what we do
Our job is to try and do the right thing but we will make judgements with the best intentions
We won’t always get it right but we will try.  The inquest continues
