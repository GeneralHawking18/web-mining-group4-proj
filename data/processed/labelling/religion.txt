The Bible is clearly not the word of God
The Bible is a book that claims to be the word of God, much like the Torah and the Quran
It also claims to contain the sayings and teachings of the Son of this God, and the Teacher who paved the way to salvation
The problem is, this is simply not true
The Bible contains numerous contradictions, errors, barbarism, absurdities, and other embarrassing things, some of which will be listed below
Others will follow if necessary
I would like to do this kind of post in regards to other holy books, like the Quran or BoM, but that’s for another time
Contradictions: A really awkward one appears in Chronicles and Samuel
There’s a story where David has a census, and god gets ticked off
Then he makes a bunch of people in Israel get sick
It’s a fairly straightforward story, but there exists a serious contradiction
One account says that God rose up against Israel, but another said that it was Satan
Another one exists in the genealogy of Jesus (a minor one, but still)
They are wildly different, which obviously doesn’t bode well
Or perhaps you could consult Moses
He says he saw God in Genesis 32, but John 1:18 says that no one has seen god
Which is it? Is Moses lying? Is he wrong? On the subject of morals, the Bible clearly has none
In the OT, slavery, rape, and genocide are all condoned by god to various degrees
Numbers 31, deut 20, and 1 Samuel 15 are the best examples
God permits slavery in passages like Lev 20, Ex 20-21, and others
Deuteronomy 22 says that a raped woman must marry her rapist.  That’s messed up
Numbers 31:18 says that kidnapping young Midianite girls and taking them for sex slaves is fine
And on and on and on
For errors, the Bible has them in abundance
It repeatedly makes claims that are simply not true
It claims that there was a mass exodus from Egypt by Israel (I’ve also done a debate about this in this sub recently too) it claims that a senior citizen with no shipbuilding knowledge built a giant boat with all the animals.  That is plainly ridiculous
It also talks about a garden of Eden, which doesn’t exist
There are still more, and I wouldn’t just unload them all on the first post
My point is this: the Bible cannot be trusted in its moral, historical, or scientific claims
If none of these claims hold to basic scrutiny, how can it be the word of God The Bible is not divinely inspired.

There is no evidence from the NT that the gospels were authored by eyewitnesses: they are undeniably written anonymously and in the third person and contain no accidental or intentional references by the authors to suggest that they were present for the events or dialog related there
Furthermore, the consensus of academic scholars is that the earliest gospel (Mark) was written two generations after Jesus' death, the last (John) written three generations after
Furthermore, even by tradition, two of the gospels (Mark and Luke) were not authored by eyewitnesses, and Luke was a merely a companion of Paul, who himself was not an eyewitness
Furthermore, the Gospel of John contains text that suggests the author(s) were not eyewitnesses
Finally, the earliest reliable reference to the gospels we have under the names of the four evangelists comes about a century after the synoptics were written**, suggesting that the authors were an invention of much later Christians In other words, there are very good reasons to believe not only that the gospel were not authored by eyewitnesses -- let alone the ones whose names they bear in modern Bibles -- but that we literally have no idea who wrote them,  which is the consensus of academic scholars, which means we have no idea if they even got their information from eyewitnesses Despite this, most Christians insist that the traditio handed down by earlier Christians concerning  who wrote the gospels is unquestionably accurate**
This is what most Christians teach their children, it a common fact cited in Christian stories and sermons, and Christian apologetics frequently rely heavily on the assumption that the gospels were written by the named eyewitnesses (Matthew &amp; John) or their close companions (Mark &amp; Luke)
For instance, see The Case for Jesus Christ Rests on the Evidence of Eyewitnesses But it seems extremely odd that Christians feel the need to insist that this is true
After all, the gospels undeniably contain accounts of events and dialog that the named eyewitnesses could not have been (or were very unlikely to be) present to witness
Examples include events related to Jesus' birth and baptism, events related to Jesus' arrest and trial and execution, events on the day of the discovery of the empty tomb Many Christians believe that the gospel accounts of these events are completely accurate -- and for large numbers of Christians, that these events even literally happened as described -- despite the lack of eyewitness testimony
Why? Because both Protestant and Catholic Christians generally believe that the NT was authored by God, who used the Holy Spirit to divinely inspire the authors of the gospels to write only what God wanted written and to write it completely accurately
For instance, here's what the  Catechism of the Catholic church say  God is the author of Sacred Scripture because he inspired its human authors; he acts in them and by means of them
He thus gives assurance that their writings teach without error his saving truth And here's what the Southern Baptist North American Mission Boar has to say God breathed out His Word by using godly men to write down exactly what He wanted them to write.  . .
The Bible is inspired: God is its ultimate author
The Bible is inerrant: God used human authors to write exactly what He wanted without error
The Bible is infallible: It is incapable of error and will accomplish exactly what God wants But here's the problem: if Christians really believ this, why does it matter who wrote the gospels, why does it matter that the authors of the gospels were eyewitnesses? Anyone could have written the gospels inerrantly if in fact it was ultimately God who was telling them exactly what to write and was ensuring that what they wrote was without error I propose that the only reasonable explanation is that -- lip service aside -- these Christians who insist the gospels had to be written by eyewitnesses no longer actuall have faith that the NT was divinely authored by God via the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, which is understandable, because it's frankly hard to reconcile such a belief with the numerous discrepancies (and other problems) that are obviously present in the gospels (as we see presented on virtually a daily basis in this sub)
In other words, they lack faith that these texts were actually divinely inspired, and so hope to bolster the reliability of the gospels by claiming they are eyewitness testimony, something that should be completely unnecessary if they were divinely inspired As an aside, let me also explain why I think this is unethical / dangerous It's a common tactic for religious cults to hide their dirty laundry from their children and new recruits, to lead them along with simple and easy stories and beliefs until they are safely in the fold, only for them to later discover that the reality is not what they were taught
As one of many examples, we know Scientologists hid information about Xenu from the rank and file for decades, only exposing it to a select few
Obviously, such behavior is deceptive and unethical It's also extremely brittle
Just like it's very easy these days for Scientologists to learn about Xenu, it's very easy these days for Christians to get exposed to the academic consensus concerning the authorship of the gospels -- a consensus that's generally pretty easy to validate on your own by reading the relevant portions of the NT and 2nd-century references -- which means that this alone can act as a wedge that starts Christians questioning the truth of what they have been taught In my opinion, this is one of several serious clefts in Christian belief that is adding to the exodus of Christians from the faith
Christians need to decide whether the NT is accurate because it's divinely inspired -- in which case they need to come up with a reasonable explanation for how it can be so problematic -- or that it is accurate because it was written by eyewitnesses or people relying on the direct testimony of eyewitnesses -- which is going to be a tough sell for the reasons described above -- or some other TBD explanation [** The one well-known exception I should address is Papias, who later church fathers quote as claiming that there were writings attributed to Matthew and Mark in the very early second century
The well-established problem is that the description of these writings does not match the gospels attributed to those evangelists in the NT
Specifically, Papias states that Matthew's writings were in Hebrew, whereas the scholarly consensus is that the Gospel of Matthew was originall written in Greek, and also suggests these consist just of logi , or divine sayings, especially one spoken by Jesus
Likewise, he says that Mark made it his one concern not to omit anything he had heard, which is hard to believe applies to the Gospel of Mark, since that gospel lacks things like the Lord's Prayer or any stories about Jesus appearing after his resurrection
As a result, Papias is not only not a reliable attribution concerning who wrote the gospels, he demonstrates why it's reasonable to question the accuracy of the tradition handed down by the earliest Christians
The insistence by most Christians that the gospels were authored by eyewitnesses shows they lack faith that the Holy Spirit divinely inspired these texts
Modern day Muslims cannot make claims to absolute morality
The evidence for this is that Mohammad, the individual who invented Islam, took a child bride when he was in his 50's
According to writings, he both married her and years later consummated the marriage before his wife's age could be counted in double digits
This is not an attack or an insult
This is a fact one can google
Aisha was married at 6 and then slept with her when she was 9
Today, I would hope that modern day Muslims condemn the practice of child brides.  I believe most do
Muslims are not awful people and by and large are quite peaceful
There's a lot that's good about them and even about their religion
However, I do not understand the mental gymnastics Muslims go through to reconcile condemning children brides versus the actions of their prophet
I do not understand how Muslims can claim morality is objective if something so clearly abhorrent was right for one person AND wrong for everyone else at the same time
Do have it wrong? Do Muslims claim that morality is subjective Modern day Muslims cannot make claims to absolute morality.
Definition: -- Pantheism: the belief that the universe itself is the divine -- ∈ : means is a member of (e
g 5 ∈ The set of all prime numbers) For completeness, the argument from contingency goes as follows Everything is either contingent or non-contingent If everything was contingent, there'd be an infinite regress of contingency (absurd) Thus, there must be something that is non-contingent Thesis: The argument of contingency points to Pantheism The argument goes as follows Let A be the set of all contingent things (e. g
our universe, potentially multiverses and whatnot) If A is contingent, then A ∈ A -----(since A would contain anything contingent, including itself) If ∈ , then is contingent on ------(the same way an atom is contingent on its subatomic constituents) We can chain the relation A ∈ A to get an infinite descending sequence: . .
∈ A ∈ A ∈ A Parsing the infinite sequence of (4) in the language of (3) gives: A is contingent on A, which is contingent on A, which is again contingent on A, . .
ad infinitum This is an infinite regress of contingency hence absurd Since A being contingent leads to absurdity, A must be non-contingent Recall that A is tentatively the set that would contain our universe (and potentially other universes etc)
No There could only be one non-contingent thin (which is given the title God But A and God are both non-contingen They must be the same thing Thus, God is simply a label given to the set of all contingent things like our universe and so on, ie
Pantheism Potential objection The language of contingency doesn't apply to set  ----- A set is just a label we give to a particular group of things
Just like how universe is the label given to spacetime, matter, energy, quantum fields, etc etc
If you talked about the contingency of the universe, then you have already used the language of contingency on set Theists who use The Argument from Contingency undermine the idea of a creator.
According to this articl (or this much shorter summar if you prefer), metaphysical naturalism (and therefore atheism) is false for the following reasons • Consciousness: there is more to consciousness than just scientific law
As Thomas Henry Huxley put it; how it is that any thing so remarkable as a state of consciousness comes about as the result of irritating nervous tissue, is just as unaccountable as the appearance of the Djin when Aladdin rubbed his lamp
• Free will: many atheists dismiss free will, believing that the universe is deterministic in nature
This presents a problem, as Dr
Angus Menuge puts it; before we can talk of being responsible for our decisions, we need an account of why those decisions belong to us
But the trouble is, on a naturalistic view, there is no entity that can plausibly own any mental states, there is simply a plurality of parallel, impersonal processes in the brain
• Purpose: the fact that we feel in us an intrinsic purpose contradicts the nihilism inherent in naturalism • Reason (math, science, etc
): reason requires the existence of immaterial things, as C.  S
Lewis puts it: If minds are wholly dependent on brains, and brains on biochemistry, and biochemistry (in the long run) on the meaningless flux of the atoms, I cannot understand how the thought of those minds should have any more significance than the sound of the wind in the trees
• Objective moral facts: what justification is there that obviously bad things are bad? As Stuart Goetz and Charles Taliafero put it, it is not clear how one can establish normative values on the basis of processes that are ultimately thoroughly unconscious, nonnormative, and contingent in nature
In conclusion, there are variety of immaterial things that naturalism cannot explain, so it is therefore impossible for it to be true Arguments against naturalism.
The idea of voluntary necessity is that an action is a necessity because it is predestined to occur, but it is also voluntarily done by the human being who does the action because they undertook the action without coercion
Theologians have said that this makes the human being capable of being held responsible for their actions If an action is predestined to occur voluntarily, it must be that human being who will voluntarily carry out that action is predestined to exist at just that time and place God predestined the action in question, but also predestined every other action in history that led to the creation of human being that would voluntarily carry out the action Therefore, the human being is not responsible for the action being voluntary Therefore, the human being is not responsible for the action God is responsible Edit: another way to put it Action 'A' is predestined to occur In order for 'A' to occur voluntarily human 'H' with preferences 'P' must exist Therefore 'P' must be predestined as well is not responsible for is not responsible for Voluntary necessity does not confer responsibility

The argument is this P1If God is essentially all knowing then he will depend upon the objects of his knowledge in order to posses his essential propert 02 God is essentially all-knowin God depends upon the objects of his knowledge in order to possess his essential property The reasoning is this If God knows all things including how many revolutions the sun will make around the Earth at the time that Christopher Columbus is sailing across the ocean to discover America Well if Columbus never set sail then God would not possess knowledge of the above that because the above fact is not actually fact So in order for God to know the number of revolutions of the Sun at the time of Columbus's voyage Columbus must make his voyage and there must also be sun Thus God has to create in order to possess his essential property of knowing because without creating you'll end up being wrong and therefore not have knowledg God's knowledge makes him contingent on non-god thonhs
CAN PROVE atheism has monopoly on moral realism God= ultimate essentially omniscient all powerful intelligenc Moral realism= the proposition that there are prescriptive proposition's like you ought to kill murders p1 propositions must exist logically prior to knower who knows the p2 God knows proposition The existence of propositions is logically prior to the existence of Go Since God is ultimate he has no contingency so if god explains propositions then his essential knowledge makes him contingent, which is contradictio Since there are only to options for ultimate, god and not god defeating god makes atheism the only remaining candidat Thus the only ultimate worldview compatible with propositions (including moral ones) is atheis Atheists have a monopoly on moral realism
Perhaps that understanding was inspired by God The above line was in a different topic, but one I have seen countless times
I'd love to know what this common phrase actually mean I've been inspired by several different events/situations/people in my life to then produce some artistic representation, be it a song, a poem, a photograph, a picture, a machinima, whatever
(all, I have to say, to a very amateur standard!), but the outcome of each of them was produced from my own mind and my own highly personal and subjective interpretation One of the things we love about all forms of art including literature, is the subjective and personal spin on common human feelings, emotions and experiences When claims are made the bible is divinely inspired, does this mean what I have described above? Or is god inspiring to a point he is actually making sure that what is written is what he wante written Does it just mean the writer was inspired by the ide of god, or inspired by previous writers Did god actually send an angel to tell Abraham to go and slaughter his son or did he whisper into someone's ear to write a story about it, or was the writer 'inspired' by the idea of a deity doing something along those lines To claim that an understanding was inspired by god, implies that this understanding is correct, without any discussion of how this took place, what personal spin was put on the inspiration by the writer, it comes across as 'have your cake and eat it' writ large, any errors or sections that (a few thousand years later) are shown to be unpalatable to us are written off as 'yeah, human error, god only inspire it, he didn't write it, but the rest is true, trust me bro' If 'inspiring' is the process by which the bible was written, it is wors than letting us just figure shit out for ourselves
It places stamp of authority and veracity over works that have been tainted by highly personal subjectivity, published work where the editor, the publisher, the proof-reader and the procurer wash their hands of all responsibility of error, fully happy to claim ownership of anything within that meets approval, and anything else becomes 'nuffin to do wiv me guv' Divine inspiration is terrible process to publish ideas that are important to humanity Divine inspiration is a terrible process to publish ideas that are important to humanity
There is no divine Allah present in heavens, and Muhammad had to make Islamic laws on his own
Since Muhammad was only a human, and he was also not well-educated, thus He made huge 'Mathematical Mistakes' while distributing the inheritance
Moreover, your human intellect will also guide you clearly that these Islamic Rulings are Ridiculous and devoid of any Wisdom And as expected, these are ONLY Women who have to suffer due to these ridiculous rulings
(1) When SHARES make less than the Estate (An 'Asbah عصب Case For example, If a person dies and the heir is one daughter, his parents, and his wife, then The share of the daughter is 1/2 of the estate, based on the verse: . .
and if there is only one daughter, then she shall have half the inheritance
[Qura 4:1 And the share of the parents is 1/6 + 1/6 = 1/3 of the estate, based on the verse: . .
For parents, a sixth share of inheritance to each if the deceased left children [Qura 4:1 And the wife’s share = 1/8 of the estate, based on the verse: …they get an eighth of that which you leave [Qura 4:1 The total number of shares is 1/2 for the daughter + 1/3 for the parents + 1/8 for the wife = 0
96 … In other words, if the deceased left behind 1000 USD, the qaadi (judge) would need only 960 USD to distribute to them according to the Qur’an
And 40 USD are still left behind
When Muhammad was confronted with this mistake, then it was impossible for him to correct it mathematically
Thus, he solved this problem by telling to give the rest of estate to the next nearest Male relative (Source: Sahih Muslim, 1615 )
This is known as 'Asbah عصب Although this rest amount of 40 USD in this case, seems to be a small amount for the next male relative, but little did Muhammad know, that it will prove to be a fatal mistake
It led to Islamic Rulings which are ridiculous, illogical and injustice towards women
Let us first present some examples, and your human intellect will automatically guide you that these inheritance laws are unjust and devoid of any wisdom There are many online Islamic Inheritance Calculators present online
For example Calculator Calculator Please use any online calculator to verify the following examples
1st Example: Old Widow will get 25%, while a MALE relative (even a distant one like cousin, or his son, or his grandson) will get 75% If the deceased person has no children, but only a wife, and only a distant male relative, then they will get shares as under Relativ Share Fractio Share Percentag Wif 1/ 25 Any distant Male relative (like cousin or even his descendents 3/ 75 A wife stays with her husband the whole of her life
But when she is old and becomes a widow, then she will get only 25% of inheritance
While the 75% inheritance goes to any distant male relative, like cousin (or any of his descendent), whom the deceased person might not have seen in his entire life
Does this make any sense to you Do you see any Divine Wisdom in this Islamic law Do you think Muhammad/Allah has done justice with women here But the opposite is not valid, ie
if a woman dies then the Husband will inherit all her property, despite the presence of her distant relatives
2nd Example: Mother will get 33
33%, while distant relatives (like cousins, or his son, or his grandson) will get 66
67 Similarly, if a deceased person has only an old mother and a distant male relative, then they will get their share as under Relativ Share Fractio Share Percentag Mothe 1/ 33
33 Any distant Male relative (like cousin or even his descendents 2/ 66
67 So, the old mother will get only 33
33%, while a cousin (or his descendents, whom the deceased person might not have seen in his entire life) will get 66
67% Why Do you see any divine WISDOM here 3rd Example: Sister will get much more share in inheritance than the mother and the wif Even if the sister is married, still she will get more share in inheritance than mother
Relativ Share Fractio Share Percentag Mothe 2/ 40 Siste 3/ 60 Mother is more closely related to her son, then brother/sister relationship
But the illogical division of shares by Quran made it happen that a sister gets more than mother in inheritance (even if the sister is married)
Moreover, a widow will get even less than the mother, and the sister's share will become even bigger
Relativ Share Fractio Share Percentag Wif 1/ 25 Siste 3/ 75 Moreover, even if a deceased person has a daughter, still half of the property will go to the sister (even if she is married)
Relativ Share Fractio Share Percentag Daughte 1/ 50 Any distant Male relative (like cousin or even his descendents 1/ 50 All these unjust and ridiculous shares are a product of illogical Islamic laws of inheritance, which are devoid of any divine wisdom
(2) When SHARES make MORE than the Estate (An 'Awl عو Case For example, If a person dies and the heirs are three daughters, his parents, and his wife, then The share of the three daughter is 2/3 of the estate, based on the verse: . .
If (the heirs of the deceased are) more than two daughters, they shall have two-thirds of the inheritance [Qura 4:1 And the share of the parents is 1/6 + 1/6 = 1/3 of the estate, based on the verse: . .
For parents, a sixth share of inheritance to each if the deceased left children [Qura 4:1 And the wife’s share = 1/8 of the estate, based on the verse: …they get an eighth of that which you leave [Qura 4:1 The total number of shares is 2/3 for the daughter + 1/3 for the parents + 1/8 for the wife = 1
12 In other words, if the deceased left behind 1000 dinars, the qaadi (judge) would need 1125 dinars to distribute to them according to the Qur’an, which he doesn't have Muhammad died without telling any solution to this mathematical mistake in the Quran or Hadith
Later, a similar case came to 'Umar Ibn Khattab, and he also didn't know how what to do
Nevertheless, someone suggested him to reduce the share of all heirs proportionally, and 'Umar followed this self-fabricated solution in order to solve this mathematical mistake of the Quran lin )
Nevertheless, Ibn Abbas didn't agree with him, and Shia Muslims also don't agree with 'Umar
They came up with another self-fabricated solution lin )
In Islam, the Creator o Two Trillion Galaxie can’t add fractions, and thus Islamic Sharia has one Quranic Mathematical Error and 2 self-fabricated solutions (3) Linguistic Mistake in the Qura Quran 4:1 فَإِن كُنَّ نِسَآءً فَوْقَ ٱثْنَتَيْنِ فَلَهُنَّ ثُلُثَا مَا تَرَكَ If (the heirs of the deceased are) more than two daughter , they shall have two-thirds of the inheritanc Allah is incorrectly using the phrase more than two daughter  when He actually wanted to say two or more daughter  It is a clear linguistic mistake, and it happened while no Allah is present in heavens, and Muhammad was making the revelation on his own.  ** Taken from https://atheism-vs-islam. com

God's plans are perfect The entire universe runs according to God's plan The universe God planned contains rape To suppose universe without rape would be better is to declare one's own imagined universe superior to God's real one To suppose oneself superior to God is the sin of Satan If you wish rape didn't exist you are as bad as Satan (so suggests certain Christian theology...)
We are born with blank mind so it’s up to our parents to teach us right from wrong, but the thing is all of our parents have sinned, which means they never truly knew right from wrong, and they passed their flawed teaching to us which obviously made us all sin in return! How can prove this? I’ve sinned but don’t remember committing my first sin, nor do remember it being sin, therefore i’m being judged for something wasn’t even aware of which sucks extraordinarily! The point is god gave us two sinners for parents to teach us right from wrong and will judge us accordingly, that make no sense! Jesus’s parents were wise and firm and he turned out sinless and perfect yet get trailer park redneck mom who is an alcoholic that hooks up for fix and beat her childrens and gotta try to find the lord all while fight her drug addict lover and try to save my siblings from being murdered, at this point realized why millions of people suicide, not everyone is fit to live yet are forced to live by god for his glory which left me amazed considering he is just random cosmic entity that we’ve never even met! Anyway what do yall think? god gave us sinner parents
I believe that confirmation bias underscores the problems with assessing reality and coming to the conclusion of a deity
If we critically examine our givens -- the pieces of information we are taking for granted or assuming a prior -- we will find that a lot of the arguments about religion are based on assumptions that are unsound
I believe the best example of this is the brute fact of existence The question has famously been asked, Why is there anything at all  or Why is there something rather than nothing? There can't be a causal answer to this question, nothing can cause existence, because the cause must have existed
If we pull this string far enough, we are forced to accept the Brute Fact of Existence
Something simply was, and we cannot pull the string any farther The brute fact of existence has devastating consequences for the ideological framework that underscores religious arguments and demonstrates how that framework is infected by biased thinking and assumptions
The idea that something simply exists is intuitively offensive to mankind
The lack of an explanation is an assault on the senses, and our pattern recognition immediately seeks one
God is a prophylactic for this problem
The mysterious, reverent, and all-powerful nature of such a thing is easier to accept in the circumstances, however, to accept it is to not critical examine our givens We must accept that something simply exists
How we extrapolate this fact is extremely perilous
Every single religious argument does so by refusing to critical examine their givens
I will go through the main arguments and demonstrate this Argument from Contingency The argument from contingency claims that some things are contingent and other things are necessary and that contingent things depend on necessary things to exist
It could be said, for example, that an atom depends on protons, neutrons, and electrons to exist, and in that way it is contingent
However, this does not let us arrive at deity, as science knows that there are fundamental particles that are not composed of other things, which satisfy this specific rendition of necessary vs contingent
There are other renditions, but they fail to withstand scrutiny
For example, it has been proposed that the fact that particles move within spacetime and can be moved by other particles suggests that they are contingent, but this is clearly dissimilar to the compositional contingency referred to earlier, and shouldn't be conflated
We have gone from composed of other things vs not composed of other things to unchangeable/immoveable vs changeable/movable
This does not withstand scrutiny, as there is no basis for supposing that non-compositional objects must also be immoveable
It's merely a semantic sleight-of-hand to compile both attributes into this framework called contingency
Remember that we are scrutinizing our givens
Why do we assume that the brute fact of existence constitutes an immoveable/unchangeable object? After all, location and existence are not identical concepts, and it cannot be said that a particle stops existing once it moves elsewhere First Caus The above argument flows quite neatly into the first cause argument, which supposes that the causal chain of reality must hit a stopping point, which is therefore God
This approach also fails to critical examine one's givens For an object to exist, it must have properties
We know that there is something rather than nothing
This something has properties Given that something simply exists, we must ask -- what reason do we have to dictate the properties of this initial something as being conscious or divine? There cannot be a causal mechanism for the initial state of affairs, definitionally, and given the brute fact of existence, we have to accept that this state simply was
Therefore, what reason do we have to assume that it is something resembling a divine personal conscious deity, rather than a Big Bang scenario, like the one we actually know existed This is, of course, assuming that there was an initial state at all rather than a perpetual state of change, which is another poorly scrutinized given
Physicists do not regard the finitism of the universe as a foregone conclusion, it's still very much an open question Some shift this to say that it's not about the universe or it's finitism, but rather, suggesting there is a different causal axis that God would be on, that must exist for the universe to have it's causal chain
Again, we must scrutinize our assumptions
If this were true, we would be accepting that a deity simply exists and set our universe into motion
Why would we assume that rather than the possibility that the universe necessarily had the function of being in motion, or being poised to set into motion in it's initial state An argument that relies on assigning properties to an eternal necessary being is indefensible, as those properties can quite easily apply to the natural universe Fine Tuning Argumen Fine Tuning makes a similar error in it's failure to examine it's givens
We do not know if there was an initial state of existence or if the universe is infinite
Or at least, physicists don't know and I am not arrogant enough to place myself above them The argument goes that certain conditions within the universe allowed for life which, if altered, would not allow life
It's circularly obvious that if conditions allow for life, there are conceivable conditions which do not allow for life Sometimes the compelling portion of this argument relies on the claim that small changes would render life moot, so the universe must be fine-tuned for us to exist at all
However, this presupposes that there cannot be other forms of life which would've arisen in these other conditions
This argument merely represents our inability to know what we don't know
This model can more or less be represented in every major religious argument -- lack of scrutiny applied to prior assumptions, and confirmation bias The Brute Fact of Existence &amp; Confirmation Bias - a fatal flaw in every religious argument
An interesting contradiction in contemporary Baha’i ideology is the religions purported commitment to the liberalistic ideals of a society without prejudice and its attitude towards homosexuality
In this post my aim is to demonstrate the issues with Baha’i attempts to reconcile the two
To organize my thoughts, my ‘opening statement’ if you will is this; Modern Baha’i apologia emphasizes two points in order to make its stance on homosexuality palatable to liberal sensibilities
The first is that the Faith hates the sin not the sinner and one is free to be a homosexual Baha’i so long as they remain ‘publicly’ celibate
The second is to argue that the Faith does not impose its stances on non-Baha’is I feel that these two points are legitimately believed by most Baha’is, however I believe both are fundamentally incompatible with the philosophy outlined by the authoritative figures of the Faith for two reasons The first is that the Faith does not recognize homosexuality as a legitimate identity, instead viewing it as an aberration which can and should be cured
While in terms of administrative sanction the Faith does not advocate for actively seeking out ‘celibate’ homosexuals for reprimand or intervention philosophically this is exactly what the Faith actually advocates and is what the teachings expect of homosexuals joining the community The second is that the Faith’s explicit aim is to assume governance of society and it explicitly rejects the idea that the Faith will not impose Baha’i laws on society at some point in the future Before supporting my arguments as some background, I should note that while in most religious traditions it is entirely incorrect to make blanket statements about what a religious is or what it believes based on administrative communications, however the structure of the Baha’i Faith is such that its entire belief system is defined by its administrative communications with disagreement and reformation not really being possible
In the Will and Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Baha the following open mandate is given to the two bodies which I will draw most of my quotations from The sacred and youthful branch, the Guardian of the Cause of God, as well as the Universal House of Justice, to be universally elected and established, are both under the care and protection of the Abhá Beauty, under the shelter and unerring guidance of the Exalted One (may my life be offered up for them both)
Whatsoever they decide is of God
Whoso obeyeth him not, neither obeyeth them, hath not obeyed God; whoso rebelleth against him and against them hath rebelled against God; whoso opposeth him hath opposed God; whoso contendeth with them hath contended with God; whoso disputeth with him hath disputed with God; whoso denieth him hath denied God; whoso disbelieveth in him hath disbelieved in God; whoso deviateth, separateth himself and turneth aside from him hath in truth deviated, separated himself and turned aside from God
May the wrath, the fierce indignation, the vengeance of God rest upon him! https://www. bahai
org/library/authoritative-texts/abdul-baha/will-testament-abdul-baha/2#18913781 So the above demonstrates that the Faith as it defines itself deems disagreeing with a statement of the Guardian or the Universal House of Justice to be disagreeing with God and being an action worthy of incurring his vengeance
Actively disagreeing with the philosophy of these bodies is punishable by excommunication and shunning, as such I feel I am justified in defining the views of the ‘Baha’i Faith’ solely by the quotes below With that preamble out of the way, here is a quote from a 1987 letter of the UHJ I feel debunks the argument that a homosexual can be a Baha’i, they are merely asked to be celibate . .
the Faith does not recognize homosexuality as a natural or permanent phenomenon
Rather, it sees this as an aberration subject to treatment, however intractable exclusive homosexuality may now seem to be
To the question of alteration of homosexual bents, much study must be given, and doubtless in the future clear principles of prevention and treatment will emerge
As for those now afflicted, a homosexual does not decide to be a problem human, but he does, as you rightly state, have decision in choosing his way of life, ie.  abstaining from homosexual acts.  https://bahai-library
com/compilation_homosexuality_bwc#s This I feel establishes that the idea that homosexual Baha’is are fully accepted, they are just asked not to act on their desires, is an untenable position to hold without disagreeing with the UHJ
Here they explicitly say that it is an aberration which must be treated and authoritatively pronounce that homosexuality does not have a natural cause
They also advocate for research into conversion therapy, and the argument of Baha’is that homosexuals are only expected to be celibate is shown to be temporary
The UHJ says that for those now afflicted, I emphasize the word NOW Once these principles of prevention and treatment have hypothetically emerged is the stance of the Baha’i Faith that homosexuals will have the choice of whether to maintain their aberration while being celibate? I believe this 1993 letter of the UHJ provides an answer in the negative  In consideration of the questions raised by Mrs.  .
, we summarize below some of the fundamental points made in the attached extracts Homosexuality is strongly condemned by Bahá'u'lláh (Extract ) The Bahá'í Writings do not point to the causes of homosexuality (Extract 1 1 1 ), although they do state tha Homosexuality is an aberration, and is against nature (Extract 1 1 ) Homosexuality can be overcome (Extract 1 1 1 1 1 ), an The individual is expected to make an effort to overcome the affliction (Extract 1 1 1 1 1 ).  https://bahai-library
com/uhj_homosexuality_biolog So this quote shows that it is the authoritative view that homosexuals who become Baha’is are expected to overcome their affliction
If we read this quote with the context that the UHJ has stated that principles for preventing and treating/curing homosexuality will be developed I do not believe it is a stretch to say that the UHJ is saying that homosexuals who become Baha’is will be expected to undertake whatever methods they devise to cure homosexuality in the future
The 1987 quote clearly states that homosexuality is an aberration which is to be treated, then makes a distinction between homosexuality and homosexual acts in order to state that while homosexuality can not currently be treated abstaining from homosexual acts is the only course of action to be taken
Clearly the objection in the 1987 letter is in fact to homosexuality as a state of being, and not merely with acting on homosexual impulses With that out of the way, I would like to address the second Baha’i point, that Baha’i law will only apply to Baha’is
I will state in advance I feel there is more room to disagree with my argument on why this is invalid The crux of my view that the Baha’i Faith explicitly aims to impose its laws is a 1995 letter in which the UHJ explicitly states that the Baha’i Faith does not believe in separation of church and state (apologies for wall of text, but feel a shorter excerpt would remove too much context) You also ask how these statements could be reconciled with Shoghi Effendi’s comment on page 149 of Bahá’í Administration, which appears to anticipate a future that is sure to witness the formal and complete separation of Church and State, and with the following words in his letter of 21 March 1932 addressed to the Bahá’ís of the United States and Canada Theirs is not the purpose, while endeavoring to conduct and perfect the administrative affairs of their Faith, to violate, under any circumstances, the provisions of their country’s constitution, much less to allow the machinery of their administration to supersede the government of their respective countries A careful reading of the letter dated 6 December 1928 in which the Guardian’s comment about the separation of Church and State occurs would suggest that, rather than enunciating a general principle, Shoghi Effendi is simply reviewing the quickening forces of internal reform that had recently transpired throughout the Near and Middle East, and enumerating a number of factors that impinge on the development of the Faith in those parts of the world As for the statement made by Shoghi Effendi in his letter of 21 March 1932, the well-established principles of the Faith concerning the relationship of the Bahá’í institutions to those of the country in which the Bahá’ís reside make it unthinkable that they would ever purpose to violate a country’s constitution or so to meddle in its political machinery as to attempt to take over the powers of government
This is an integral element of the Bahá’í principle of abstention from involvement in politics
However, this does not by any means imply that the country itself may not, by constitutional means, decide to adopt Bahá’í laws and practices and modify its constitution or method of government accordingly
The relationship between the principle of abstention from involvement in politics and the emergence of the Bahá’í State is commented on later in this letter
In the meantime we can quote the following extracts from letters written on behalf of the Guardian in response to queries from individual believers, which indicate that the relationship is an evolving one: - &gt https://www. bahai
org/library/authoritative-texts/the-universal-house-of-justice/messages/19950427_001/1#26774195 While the Faith does not seek to impose its views through partisan politics (and thankfully for homosexuals is likely never going to achieve the scenario outlined above) it does want to see a future in which constitutions are rewritten to adopt Baha’i laws and principles
This is a positive in regards to rights of women and resolving racial prejudice, but I believe I have demonstrated above that due to the UHJ’s official philosophy this scenario would also lead to state sponsored conversion therapy being imposed Now the one objection which could hold water is that one could argue that while the UHJ condemns homosexuality as an aberration which must be suppressed temporarily until methods of eradicating it are developed, this could be classified as advice rather than a law
I believe the following quote from Shoghi Effendi debunks this reasoning as it establishes that the Baha’i Faith essentially considers homosexuality to be a crime as it is defined as a sanctionable offense Regarding the question you asked him about one of the believers who seems to be flagrantly homosexual -- although to a certain extent we must be forbearing in the matter of people's moral conduct because of the terrible deterioration in society in general, this does not mean that we can put up indefinitely with conduct which is disgracing the Cause
The person should have it brought to his attention that such acts are condemned by Bahá'u'lláh, and that he must mend his ways, if necessary consult doctors, and make every effort to overcome this affliction, which is corruptive for him and bad for the Cause
If after a period of probation you do not see an improvement, he should have his voting rights taken away
The Guardian does not think, however, that a Bahá'í body should take it upon itself to denounce him to the Authorities unless his conduct borders on insanity.  https://bahai-library
com/compilation_homosexuality_bwc#s And while one may downplay removal of voting rights as a benign punishment Shoghi Effendi himself defined it as a harsh penalty (the harshest possible defined in Baha'i administrative guidance, with the exception of excommunication which is only for specifically challenging the structure of divine authority within the religion) The general basis for the deprivation of voting rights is of course gross immorality and open opposition to the administrative functions of the Faith, and disregard for the laws of personal status; and even then it is the duty of the National Assembly, before exercising this sanction, to confer with the individuals involved in a loving manner to help them overcome the problem; second, to warn them that they must desist; third, to issue further warnings if the original warnings are not followed; and finally, if there seems no other way to handle the matter, then a person may be deprived of voting rights The Guardian however, wishes the National Assemblies to be very cautious in using this sanction, because it might be abused, and then lose its efficacy
It should be used only when there seems no other way to solve the problem.  https://bahai
works/Lights_of_Guidance/Administrative_Rights,_Sanctions,_Dissimulatio In conclusion, while I think contemporary Baha’is wholeheartedly believe in their convictions of abolishing all prejudice and their arguments that the Baha’i Faith is not homophobic are made in good faith, their reasoning is based on ignorance of what the authoritative philosophy of the Baha’i administration is Based on the above I feel the Baha'i community as a whole is rather disingenuous (largely unintentionally) on the issue of sexuality, and it strikes me that individual Baha'is discussing sexuality put a huge amount of effort into being sensitive and empathic towards homosexuals while attempting to grapple with what their religion teaches, whereas the idealized 'infallible' figures of the Faith just made incredibly blunt statements about corruption and afflictions
It is an interesting phenomenon that a religious community feels the need to routinely alter the textual rhetoric of figures it considers to speak directly for God while also not feeling in any way that they are disagreeing with those figures
This is a particularly curious phenomenon  with respect to the Faith
The very centralized nature of its theological framework (with no views having any weight except the Central Figures, Guardian, and UHJ) generally Baha'is dedicate themselves to utilizing meticulous direct quotation in making arguments, with perhaps the sole exception being discussions on homosexuality in which they will instead paraphrase and avoid direct quotations The Baha'i Faith: A rebuttal to attempts to reconcile the Baha'i Faith and homophobia present in its philosophy
Thesis: God is unnecessarily torturou Premise 1 God created human Premise 2 God knew ahead of time some humans would 'choose' eternal suffering (a necessity for 'free will' Premise 3 God can eradicate humans that reject him but instead fate them to an eternal existence* (see caveat #1 below) to be tortured Ergo God is unnecessarily torturous, granting infinite punishment for finite sins Context Say you have God's powers to create humanit Can you explain a scenario where you would create humans knowing that some of them would choose eternal torment? If it were me, and having some of my creation be eternally damned for everlasting suffering, I would not create humanity If you are a parent, imagine this with 2 of your kids
If you have pets, think of 2 dogs or two cats;  or imagine you can create two friends Would you birth two children, knowing that one will suffer eternally? Would you adopt two pets, knowing one will forever be tortured? Would you create two friends, knowing the fate of one is eternal agony I know the answer to all of these if asked of me; it doesn't even take 1 second to answer
I ask the reader what they think of a person that goes ahead anyway? Me? I would not hold that person in high esteem; in fact, selfish is the word that comes to mind It would appear that this goes out the window with Christians and Muslims when it applies to their God Caveats The question only applies to the eternal Fire and Brimstone concept of hell Please, God works in mysterious ways, as in I don't know, but God must have a good reason, does not qualify to me as a very convincing response Many thanks for taking the time to respond EDIT 12/2/2022 Based on some conversations, I've found that I can remove both caveats and still have a sound argument Caveat #1 for annihilationists
Some humans have had an undeniable life of suffering, and are destroyed (no hell) take children in holocaust concentration camp, and people point out my caveat #2 is non-sequitur For Universalists, we'll what does any of this matter, I'll see you all soon regardless how live right God is unnecessarily torturous
Click to see spoiler If you can't choose not to sin all of the time, you don't have free will.
So, the Angel Gabriel told Mary that she would become pregrate and give birth in Luke 1:30-38 But, the Angel simply told Mary what God would do
God never asks for Mary's consent
God simply takes control and causes Mary to become pregnate This is called RAPE
God RAPED Mary because God didn't ask Mary for her consent I don't understand how modern Christians can completely ignore this story
This story is the worst story about rape that I have ever read References Luke 1:30-38 30 And the angel said to her, Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God
31 And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus
32 He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High
And the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David, 33 and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end
34 And Mary said to the angel, How will this be, since I am a virgin? 35 And the angel answered her, The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born[d] will be called holy—the Son of God
36 And behold, your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son, and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren
37 For nothing will be impossible with God
38 And Mary said, Behold, I am the servant[e] of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word
And the angel departed from her The Bible teaches that God impregnated Mary without her consent
That is rape
Earlier I posted about the double standard whereby religions and religious people promote extermination of LGTBQ+ people and consider it to be a disagreement, whereas when queer people verbally criticize homophobic religious violence it is considered to be bashing and attacking
Likewise, whenever and wherever LGBTQ+ people visibly exist, no matter what we do, we are accused of grooming, but particularly in schools and places where children are taught Meanwhile these same people who are obsessed with convincing everyone that LGBTQ+ people are all groomer pedophiles have seemingly no issues with children being taught about Mary, a young child who was impregnated by a deity without her consent, and then groomed to accept it, and this is considered to be one of the greatest miracles of all time according to Christians Same with conservative Muslims
In Dearborn they're freaking out about the LGBTQ books that are allegedly grooming children, but have no issue with Aisha being groomed to be Mohammad's bride, or the offer of virgins in heaven
Apparently that's not grooming either, according to them And in Buddhism homosexuality is considered to be misconduct and conflated with various forms of sexual abuse that are also in theory disallowed among clerg
And yet when Buddhist teachers and clergy have turned out to be sexual predators and child rapists, higher ups have recommended that their abused students continue to treat the teachers with the same filial piety as always ***correction: As it turns out, it is not just clergy for whom gay sex is considered misconduct in Buddhism
Rather, the rule is considered to apply to all Buddhists, so it was worse than I thought
Sorry for misinforming *So in summation, to be clear, since religious people report having an interest in stopping abuse and violence (and since I and many others would certainly prefer that religious people not lie and slander LGBTQ+ people as groomers and perverts and advocate that we be executed) religions and religious people should therefore stop slandering us as groomers and advocating that we be executed and instead begin trying to mitigate the untold damage and abuse on a mass scale caused by institutions they affiliate with, abuses which include thousands and thousands of actua cases of violence and grooming, which were covered up and denied and ignored for as long as possible . . . . .
Maybe deal with that instead of, like, showing up with armed thugs to threaten people for imaginary reasons at the school board meeting or the library during story time, if preventing actual abuse is indeed something that is of concern to you More double standards between religions and the LGBTQ+ community
An imaginary creature, even one whose traits solve some unknown in the real world, is still purely fictional &amp; imaginary without evidence
Pointing to the real world phenomenon and restating the claim in absolutely no way constitutes evidence Your lost keys do not prove key gnomes Lightning proves neither Zeus nor Thor The fact that people die does not prove any death gods It's the same way for religions
Insisting that you've defined your god as being able to start the universe is in absolutely no way evidence that your god started the universe
No more so than my keys not being here proves they were taken by key gnomes
The reason theists don't agree with this is part of being a theist is adopting one set of logic that you use for most everything and a second set of bad logical rules, excuses, and exceptions that are only employed for a theist's chosen religion
This is why, for example, modern day Christians would laugh at the idea of Thor being responsible for thunder (or any non-Christian religious claim) yet insist that Yahweh is the exception for which this bad logic works
It doesn't So when people talk about the Kalam cosmological argument, first causes, etc, they are talking about fictional things who exist purely in the realm of fairy tales (like Voldemort or Pokemon creatures)
To instantiate them outside of fiction, there has to be evidence
But my fictional thing solves a real world unknown isn't evidence
It's just another claim that requires evidence An imaginary creature, even one whose traits solve some unknown in the real world, is still purely fictional &amp; imaginary without evidence

What I am proposing is quite simple
There are many religions that exist
Many of those religions contradict each other
They ALL cannot be correct
While belief by blind faith is enough for Theists, that is not a logical reason for anyone to believe anything
Evidence is required Science has given us theories about the origin of our universe that we can debate over forever Why isn't the default position for every person simply, I don't know
We don't know how or why the universe came about
In fact, there are so many unknowns that anyone taking any one single position seems unreasonable
don't know can only be the one correct answer It is true that over time and as technology advances we are able to make new discoveries that answers some of those unknowns, but is it truly possible that we can ever answer the most important of these questions am not suggesting that everyone should take an agnostic approach (I consider myself an Atheist), but am curious to see what other people have to say about this The Default I don't know
Hey guys, This might be a controversial topic
However, after studying Spanish, Portuguese, French and Dutch Colonialism, I came to see that there Colonialism was different
And let's not get started with America
But it seems America unlike Dutch started to implement laws against race mixing
Catholics(regardless of nationality) race mixed with other ethnic groups in the New World, meanwhile it seems most Protestants(regardless of Nationality) didn't, why did that happened
Also why does it seem without Scientific racism some Protestants have a notion of Purity.
So, we probably know the free will argument here
For clarity's sake The suffering in the world is caused by human free wil it is vitally important to preserve human free will Ergo, a benevolent god would allow some sufferin Yes, I'm aware this is very simplified, but as I said, most of you know it
I'll be addressing two counterarguments I've not seen before As a quick clarification, I am here assuming that God is a being that can be judged morally (and is judged as a good being) If he isn' - if god could make literally the opposite decision in every choice he's ever had and be morally identical- then I have to concede defeat
An amoral god doesn't need defending, but as such a being couldn't be omnibenevolent by simple logic, it's a mutual loss By the same token, if the argument is that God is not a bein then again, I concede that what is essentially the operating system of the universe has no obligation to end suffering
However, I would also question under what grounds a mindless being entity doesn't do or think anything constitutes a God in any meaningful sense Now, assuming we have a god that is a moral agent (that is, he intentionally acts and his actions can be moral or immoral), three arguments  that an omnibenevolent being couldn't create a world with suffering even granting all acts of evil are caused by humans The Argument From Shared Guil God has extreme influence over our actions (even if we grant free will If a being you have extreme influence over the actions of commits an immoral act, you share (at least partially) their guil Humans commit immoral act Therefore, god is not all-good (as he shares guilt in a number of immoral acts God obviously has a huge amount of control over our actions- he created us, he created our brain chemistry, he created our environments, he created everything
He has a strong- maybe total- amount of influence over what we chose
Now, maybe you're a compatiablist and think that doesn't affect free will
I actually agree! But, even granting that the wicked among us do evil things of their own free will, god's influence makes him culpable too Let's take a mass shooter
The mass shooter is responsible for his evil acts, obviously
But most mass shooters are incels, so what about those people who promoted that ideology to him? What of demagogues who talked to him about how all women are whores and deserved violent revenge, what of the forum-goers who egged him on? Most would agree that they share the guilt, to some extent As influence gets stronger, so too does shared guilt
For example, we generally consider Hitler completely responsible for all the evil acts of Nazi Germany
It all acted under his orders, in a system he designed, so he holds the blame for the actions of those actors (who, again, are still morally culpable for their part)
Note this even includes the actions he was not directly responsble- there were plenty of people killed by the Nazis without any orders from above, but Hitler's control over Germany was such he can still be held responsible
But even the most oppressive tyrant has only a fraction of the control over their minions that God has over us With his extreme control over what we choose, God holds significant moral blame for the actions of evil people regardles of whether the evil people do too*
* At best, the Moral Argument shows that humanity and God share equal blame for the state of the world
But of course, we're not claiming to be all good
God is As any evil acts humans do god shares at the very least a significant amount of responsibility for, this world is a moral indictment upon its creator
Ergo, an tri-omni god doesn't exist The Argument From Immoral Bystander If you have the power to stop an act of evil and don't, you have done an immoral thin God has the power to stop acts of evil and doesn't Ergo, an all-good god can't exis This is simple
Let us suppose I see a child being beaten to death
Now, this is not my fault
I'm not responsible for the child's attack in any way, I have no blame here
This brutal murder is entirely outside of my responsibility
But surely, even granting this, is it not still immoral for me to sit back and watch Even granting that God is not responsible for the acts of evil in the world, this doesn't discharge the responsibility to d something about them
Even if we have pure, libertarian free will and say the mass shooter acted purely uncausedly? Even if we grant a form of omniscience where God didn't know the mass shooter would act until they started shooting? This doesn't change the fact there is still an obligation to stop the mass shooter
You are not only obligated to stop evil you personally caused As the universe has a huge amount of suffering that God could stop but doesn't, there is still a moral implausibility here
Even if God is not responsible for the creation of evil we can still raise the question as to why he didn't destroy it once it came into being, bringing the problem of suffering back into focus The Argument From Robotic The Free Will defense depends on a being having free will being an overwhelming good However, we have good reason to think that granting a being free will can be evil Ergo, the free will defense doesn't work I kind of want to just quote Unravelled here- What kind of sicko creates a sapient crash test dummy? But I'll expand Lets take a bomb disposal robot
Admittedly, we can't make a sentient bomb disposal robot.  But suppose we could
AI was advanced enough we could make robots that were as capable of feeling fear and pain as humans
Would it be moral to make the bomb disposal robot sapient Well- no, right? You're creating a mind purely to put it in continuous situations of mortal terror
To give a being a genuine mind rather then a robotic algorithm in a situation where a sapient mind would be undergoing extreme distress is wrong
You can come up with other examples- Sapient video game enemies, say, or the aforementioned sapient crash test dummies
Even if possible, there are situations where its unethical to create a sapient free willed being over a mindless automaton Is existence one of those cases Well- lots of it are
Lots of people do experience extreme terror, despair and pain for most or all of those life
Surely, the same standard by which the sapient crash test dummy is monstrous applies here- for such people, you should create a robot
Creating a mind directly into a situation where it will experience extreme suffering is wrong- it is more ethical to make a mindless robot If nothing else, it seems there is no reason for anima life to be more then automata in a world so allegedly anthropocentric
Yet, as far as we can tell animals have fully functional minds But in this case, free will is not a counter to the problem of suffering
It is possible for granting a being free will to be an act of evil in and of itself, and it seems like a lot of cases of free willed entities we see are such cases Ergo, our world is still a world its immoral to make, and thus an omnibenevolent being doesn't exis TL;D Even granting free will, god still holds moral responsibility for the acts of humans, still holds moral responsibility for not stopping the results of human free will, and still holds moral responsibility for the act of creating conscious self-willed life at all
As these are serious moral charges, free will doesn't resolve the problem of suffering Free Will is not a valid defense of an Omnibenevolent God: arguments from shared guilt, the immorality of bystanders and robotics.
Insisting that evidence of an unsupported claim is possible/might exist/could be out there is not interchangeable with actual evidence
I have noticed this trend in discussions here where, when confronted to supply evidence, debates turn towards, Well there COULD be evidence.  Sure.  That's great
I have no argument with the statement save that it's incomplete What it SHOULD mean is There could be evidence but without that evidence this claim is HIGHLY unlikely to be true / as good as false Too often what it's implied to mean is, There could be evidence and that should give some credence to this claim
It's a sort of scam; a way to try to make evidence be interchangeable with possible evidence This is not how reality works I can draw a square circle does not become any less false if I word it, There could be evidence I can draw a square circle
If I say, You (complete stranger reading this reddit post) owe me $50
00 do you feel any need to pay up if I word the claim as, It's possible you owe me $50. 00.  Like sure.  It's possible
But without empirical evidence it's not something you need to take seriously
And if lean on that possibility like it counts as evidence then I'm just being troll It's the exact same way for religious claims Insisting that this or that is possible when evidence is sorely needed is just dishonest tactic to muddy the waters The possibility of evidence versus actual evidence
I am no longer Christian but with all that's going on they are going to be persecuted not because of God but because of all the bigots and fascists  are going to become the outward face and they do nothing. .
Yet they have one of the simplest religions because here is the thing: According to Christianity Jesus died for everyone's sins correct? And by accepting him and God you are saved correct? Then talking of sin and hell is of the devil because all it does is push people away from God
Instead of speaking of that Christians should do what Jesus told them was the two greatest commandments above the others: Love God and Love Thy Neighbor
EVERYTHING else in the Bible is irrelevant Jesus already took all of your sins
Oh that woman got an abortion? She is saved anyway.  Jesus got her
Oh those men are gay and in a relationship? Again even if a sin by the Bible Jesus already died for them too
They just have to accept it guarantee if this was how the large part of Christianity that is shown was and they denounced all the hate groups pretending to be Christians it would be much better religion Christianity needs to stop taliing about hell and sin because it is pointless.
There is plenty of debate around God's supposed benevolence - it is axiomatic in Abrahamic theology that God is Good
You should worship God because he is Good
But is that really why you worship God? I posit that that isn't at all why people worship God, because it doesn't really matter if God is Good
It doesn't really matter if God is Evil Atheists and skeptics will push back and cast doubt on the idea that God is Good
There is the Problem of Evil, which posits 'how can a Good God allow Evil to exist? Either there is no God or God is Not-Good
' Then there are the actions of Bible God himself, which - by the standards of modern society - are a bit lacking in the morality department There was the time God killed a man for an honest mistake 1 Corinthians 1 When they came to the threshing floor of Kidon, Uzzah reached out his hand to steady the ark, because the oxen stumbled 1 The Lord’s anger burned against Uzzah, and he struck him down because he had put his hand on the ark
So he died there before God Having a temper tantrum and killing a guy because he touched your special box while trying to keep it from tumbling does fall outside most people's definition of 'Good' There was the time Moses got angry with his officers because he was unsatisfied with the amount of genocide his army had committed and wanted MOR genocide Numbers 3 And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand of every tribe, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the holy instruments, and the trumpets to blow in his hand And they warred against the Midianites, as the Lord commanded Moses; and they slew all the males And they slew the kings of Midian, beside the rest of them that were slain; namely, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword And the children of Israel took all the women of Midian captives, and their little one , and took the spoil of all their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods 1 And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt, and all their goodly castles, with fire 1 And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of men and of beasts 1 And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, unto Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and unto the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by Jordan near Jericho 1 And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the congregation, went forth to meet them without the camp 1 And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, with the captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, which came from the battle 1 And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive 1 Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the Lord in the matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation of the Lord 1 Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him 1 But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves Why did the soldiers kill all the boy children but keep the little girl children alive 'for themselves'? What could medieval soldiers want with a bunch of virgin girls? Mysterious
But I digress; letting your chief prophet commit mass murder of childre is perhaps straying a bit into Not Good territory And then there was the time God fucked up Job's entire life over a bet with Satan and then reprimanded Job when Job had the gall to complain about it Abrahamic theists are quick to come up with apologia to explain why these examples of God acting Not Good are actually somehow God acting Good
And the point of this thread is - don't bother
Because it doesn't really matter if God isn't Good
It doesn't really matter if God is Evil
Here is what matters God is the omnipotent, all-powerful, Most High creator of the entire Cosmos It is impossible to oppose or defeat God God demands obedience and worship The punishment for failing to obey and worship God is damnation to Hell where you will suffer for all of eternity in unending torment The reward for compliance is eternal bliss in unending paradise And whether God is Good or Evil, right or wrong, Father or tyrant doesn't factor at all into this
If humans knew God existed but also knew God was Evil, they would still worship and obey him because the consequences for not doing so are unacceptable This is even touched on in the Bible when God finally confronts Job about Job's constant whining over his dead family Job 38 Then the Lord spoke to Job out of the storm
He said Who is this that obscures my plan with words without knowledge Brace yourself like a man I will question you and you shall answer me Where were you when I laid the earth’s foundation Tell me, if you understand Who marked off its dimensions? Surely you know Who stretched a measuring line across it On what were its footings set or who laid its cornerstone while the morning stars sang togethe and all the angels shouted for joy Who shut up the sea behind door when it burst forth from the womb when I made the clouds its garmen and wrapped it in thick darkness 1 when I fixed limits for i and set its doors and bars in place 1 when I said, ‘This far you may come and no farther here is where your proud waves halt’ Notice God's utter lack of pity for Job's horrific situation
God does not attempt to justify his actions as Good
God only reminds Job that God is Go , rambling and boasting about how powerful he is and that's why Job should shut up
God doesn't bother to explain why God is Good or why God isn't Evil - because it doesn't matter
All that matters is God can do whatever he wants and Job just has to accept the reality of that Was Lucifer only trying to overthrow an ancient, eldritch tyrant to end his evil, cosmological reign? Well, then Lucifer is still the Bad Guy not because what he was trying to do was wrong, because wrong doesn't matter, but because what he was trying to do was hopeless and doomed to fail So it's not necessary to explain why God is Good in the face of overwhelming evidence that he isn't, because even if God is Evil, your options remain subservience or Hellfire It doesn't really matter if God is Evil
When discussing the idea of whether morality exists objectively or subjectively, people will sometimes insist that God-given morality is not objective morality, that the only way morality could be objective is if not even God Himself could change it
But by that definition of objectivity, most things that exist would be subjective
God could change the universal coefficient of gravity, so gravity is subjective
I think it should be considered from the other way around: rather than objective being considered existing outside of the influence of an mind, it should be considered as existing outside of the influence of you mind
For instance, Critic says Movie is an 8/10
That is a subjective rating; Critic could change their mind and say Movie is a 10/10 and it would be no less true than their first review
But at the same time, that subjective rating objectivel exists; yo cannot change you mind about what Critic believes and have it be equally true to what they actually, objectivel believe So from that conception of objectivity, if God exists, then even though He could change morality, even though it is subjective to Hi , it is objective to u
Because it doesn't matter if you disagree with God, you don't change that reality by changing the state of you mind
Laws are subjective to the whims of the current government, but good luck arguing in any court that that means they don't objectively exist Everything that exists, exists objectively
The two greatest puzzles of Christianity are the Trinity and the crucifixion
The Trinity is apparently an awkward merging of two contradictory doctrines, and the crucifixion is apparently an awkward attempt to explain the death of a cult leader to his followers, but we should give Christianity the benefit of the doubt and ponder how the crucifixion might make sense if we assume that Christianity is really true and that Jesus was more than a merely human cult leader
Here are some things that American Tora has to say about the crucifixion Something has to cover (atone) our sins before we can approach God
A precise understanding of how atonement works is probably beyond our comprehension, but I think of it like neutralizing a bad odor
God can’t stomach our stench, so he sent Yeshua whose blood covers and removes it
His good odor becomes ours in God’s nostrils, hence the repeated description of sacrifices as a pleasing aroma to God Obviously this is meant as some sort of metaphor, but a metaphor for what? It seems to be ridiculous to think that an omniscient omnipresent God is not fully aware of everything at all times, so the notion of hiding anything from God is silly
God's omnipotence should allow God to hide things from himself if he so chooses, but that should be a simple act of his all-powerful will
If God does not want to see our sins, then God can simply not look at them, so this cannot explain the crucifixion Among other things, the Crucifixion satisfied the requirement of the Law for the death of the sinner, and the Resurrection established Yeshua’s permanent mastery of death Yet surely it must be God who makes the law, since God is omnipotent
Why would God make a law that would require someone's torturous death? And what could be the purpose of establishing Yeshua's mastery of death? These questions are courtesies in respect for the slim chance that someone might have an answer, because otherwise it is quite obvious that an all-loving and good God would no make a law that requires anyone to suffer a torturous death The crucifixion is not a reasonable expectation based upon Christian theology
It seems the crucifixion is only a part of Christian theology because the Romans crucified Jesus, and Jesus's followers had no choice but to try to make sense of that event
It had nothing to do with God, and Christians have never been able to give a good explanation for it, and so it has become one of the most obvious clues that Christianity is false
It is nothing more than religion that grew out of the cult that Jesus originally started The Crucifixion makes no sense if Christianity is true.
I begin by defining a contrary opinion, before I will explain my broader argument
A contrary opinion is a doctrine believed by Christians even though the Christians' scriptures teach the contrary For example, most Christians assert that their god YHWH does not cause bad things to happen, and the Westboro Baptist Church, which teaches the opposite (urging people to thank YHWH for, among other things, school shootings), is condemned by most Christian sects But the Christians' scriptures assert that YHWH creates bad things in various places and ways YHWH is said to create badness/misfortune/woe/evil (Isaiah 45:7; cf, GJohn 1:3) YHWH makes people deaf or mute or blind (Exodus 4:11) An evil spirit from YHWH torments a man (1 Samuel 16:14-16, 23) YHWH is said to receive advice from a lying spirit to deceive a person, and YHWH allows the lying spirit to go forth and spread lies in order to fulfill YHWH's plans against Ahab (1 Kings 22) YHWH is said to deceive prophets into giving false prophecies (Ezekiel 14:9) YHWH is said to order a king to sin in order to justify punishing the king's subjects (2 Samuel 24) YHWH is said to send people to perform real miracles and real prophecies in order to lead people away from worshipping YHWH (Deuteronomy 13:1-5) YHWH sometimes creates people with congenital disabilities even though the people born with congenital disabilities have not sinned, nor their parents (GJohn 9:1-3) YHWH is said to plan to conceal the true message about salvation from people so that they may be damned (2 Thessalonians 2:11-12) All of the preceding questionable actions by YHWH in the past can be assumed, based upon the Christians' scriptures, to be still happening because of Malachi 3:6 and James 1:17 within the Christians' scriptures, which jointly present YHWH as unchanging Having defined contrary opinion, I next describe why Christians should not be surprised when non-Christians expect Christians' beliefs to be guided by the Christians' scriptures rather than by contrary opinions 2 Timothy 3:16 says that YHWH is the author of all of the Christians' scriptures
Titus 1:2 and Hebrews 6:18 assert that YHWH cannot lie
Romans 3:4 encourages Christians to regard YHWH's words as true even if all people must be regarded as liars Stringing these claims into a coherent picture, we get the following claim easily enough: because the Christians' scriptures were written by an always truthful entity, Christians should believe the Christians' scriptures rather than any human claims which contradict the Christians' scriptures Nor should this be regarded as an empty hypothetical
Christians exist who are willing to be guided by their scriptures in rejecting, among other things, evolution, deep time, the world's sphericity, and even the germ theory of disease, the role of mental health services in dealing with mental illness, and the role of medicine in treating disease
The Westboro Baptists have even accepted as true the controversial doctrine that YHWH causes bad things in the world (which is supported by the Christians' scriptures, as I have shown), rejecting claims by Christian theologians that YHWH does not cause bad things in the world Therefore, Christians should not be surprised when non-Christians expect Christians' beliefs to be guided by the Christians' scriptures rather than by contrary opinions Any Christian who accuses my argument of taking verses out of context indirectly condemns the Christians' scriptures This is because the Christian scriptures include Christian interpretation of the Hebrew Scriptures, in which authors in the Christian scriptures will take single phrases or verses completely out of context in order to claim, falsely, that they support Christian theology
For example, GMatthew 2:14-15 explicitly cites Hosea's statement about YHWH's calling his son out of Egypt as evidence that Jesus's trip to and from Egypt was in fulfilment of a prophecy - completely ignoring that in the context of Hosea's writings, the son called from Egypt is clearly a personified Israel, with the journey from Egypt's being already fulfilled in Hosea's time by the Exodus (Hosea 11:1) Similarly, GMatthew 2:16-18 presents Herod's actions against infants as a fulfilment of Jeremiah 31:15
But Jeremiah 31:15 is part of a longer prophecy about the Jews' return from exile (Jeremiah 31, especially 31:15-17) that the Bible presents as having been fulfilled by Cyrus, not a prophecy about a future massacre of children As a final example, consider Paul's claim in Romans 3:12 that there is none that doeth good, no, not one as part of his argument about how we all need YHWH's salvation through Jesus
Paul says in Romans 3:10, however, that he is quoting what is written, presumably within the Hebrew Scriptures
Psalms 14 and 53 both contain (at 14:3 and 53:3) the phrase there is none that doeth good, no, not one
However, since Psalms 14 and 53 both open (at 14:1 and 53:1) with condemnation of all atheists as corrupt and wicked fools, it is easy to understand Psalms 14 and 53 (at 14:3 and 53:3), with their phrase there is none that doeth good, no, not one, as condemning atheists rather than all people
Certainly, this narrower view is supported by GJohn 5:29, Corinthians 5:10, and John 11, all of which talk about people doing good Because of what the Christians' scriptures say about themselves and their author, Christians should not be surprised when non-Christians expect Christians' beliefs to be guided by the Christians' scriptures rather than by contrary opinions.
Every miracle claim (including that an intelligent god exists) is a failed scientific claim without evidence
Theists (and even many non-theists) are used to giving miracles claims a highly disingenuous status: They attempt to insist that they're real or literally occurred, but. .  Provide no evidence
It's a matter of faith (pretending to know things I don't really know)
Demand the listener re-define what constitutes evidence Invokes some other logical fallacy (The bible claims it AND proves it!) or flawed reasoning (What's the evidence? Well because god did it that's the evidence!) such as changing the context (Well you CAN walk on water. .
when its frozen!) Literally every miracle claim is an example of this
It's just a matter of understanding what's being claimed Jesus walked on water! is actually the scientific claim Everything you know about Physics and Chemistry is wrong, but just for my claim for which the only 'evidence' I have is a demand you accept more claims that I can't support (like that Jesus had god powers)
An intelligent being known as god created the universe! For this one just taking the intelligent aspect
All the evidence we have so far shows that intelligence comes either A) from a creator (like a computer A. I
) or B) after an incredibly long and complex process
Neither of these are compatible with beginning everything
So for us to take the claim god is intelligent seriously we would need Evidence of what made god o Evidence of the gradual process that created god o Evidence of some other way that god could be intelligent that isn't simple yet another unsupported claim (He's intelligent because he's DEFINED as intelligent! It's the same way with any miracle claim
It's all just science claims that have terrible support Every miracle claim (including that an intelligent god exists) is a failed scientific claim without evidence
The Bible is clearly not the word of God
The Bible is a book that claims to be the word of God, much like the Torah and the Quran
It also claims to contain the sayings and teachings of the Son of this God, and the Teacher who paved the way to salvation
The problem is, this is simply not true
The Bible contains numerous contradictions, errors, barbarism, absurdities, and other embarrassing things, some of which will be listed below
Others will follow if necessary
I would like to do this kind of post in regards to other holy books, like the Quran or BoM, but that’s for another time
Contradictions: A really awkward one appears in Chronicles and Samuel
There’s a story where David has a census, and god gets ticked off
Then he makes a bunch of people in Israel get sick
It’s a fairly straightforward story, but there exists a serious contradiction
One account says that God rose up against Israel, but another said that it was Satan
Another one exists in the genealogy of Jesus (a minor one, but still)
They are wildly different, which obviously doesn’t bode well
Or perhaps you could consult Moses
He says he saw God in Genesis 32, but John 1:18 says that no one has seen god
Which is it? Is Moses lying? Is he wrong? On the subject of morals, the Bible clearly has none
In the OT, slavery, rape, and genocide are all condoned by god to various degrees
Numbers 31, deut 20, and 1 Samuel 15 are the best examples
God permits slavery in passages like Lev 20, Ex 20-21, and others
Deuteronomy 22 says that a raped woman must marry her rapist.  That’s messed up
Numbers 31:18 says that kidnapping young Midianite girls and taking them for sex slaves is fine
And on and on and on
For errors, the Bible has them in abundance
It repeatedly makes claims that are simply not true
It claims that there was a mass exodus from Egypt by Israel (I’ve also done a debate about this in this sub recently too) it claims that a senior citizen with no shipbuilding knowledge built a giant boat with all the animals.  That is plainly ridiculous
It also talks about a garden of Eden, which doesn’t exist
There are still more, and I wouldn’t just unload them all on the first post
My point is this: the Bible cannot be trusted in its moral, historical, or scientific claims
If none of these claims hold to basic scrutiny, how can it be the word of God The Bible is not divinely inspired.
Often, when Genesis is called out on its bullshit or how Noah's flood never happened or other areas where the Bible says something that very clearly didn't happen
Lots of people say things like the Bible isn't a science textbook or its a metaphor or similar
The problem with that is why isn' the Bible a science textbook? Why did God not start the book with an accurate and detailed account of the start of our universe? Why didn't he write a few books outlining basic physics chemistry and biology? Probably would be more helpful than anything in the back half of the Old Testament
If God really wanted what was best for us, he probably should've written down how diseases spread and how to build proper sanitation systems and vaccines
Jews (and I presume some Christians, but I have only ever heard Jews say this) love to brag about how the Torah demands we wash our hands before we eat as if that is proof of divine inspiration, but it would've been a lot more helpful if God expalined wh to do that
We went through 1000s of years of thinking illness was demonic possession, it would have helped countless people if we could've skipped that and go straight to modern medicine or beyond If the point of the Bible is to help people, why does it not include any actually useful information
It's not like the Bible is worried about brevity
If the Bible was actually divinely inspired and it was concerned with helping people, it would be, at least in part, science textbook The Bible should be a science textbook
Let me make it clear I’m not religious
However, I’ve heard many atheists say it would be unfair of God to send anyone to hell if he gave us free will and we are just exercising that gift
Free will is not an argument against consequences
If a cop tells you that he will give you a ticket if you speed, you still have the free will to speed, but you may have to suffer the consequence of a ticket Like I said, I’m not religious but I think that argument isn’t necessarily good
Just my opinion Saying God gave us free will is not a good argument against hell.
Hey everyone, My  emphasis is on Some
I'm not saying every Protestant group has this  issue
However, it seems that Some of them do
What do I mean by  'extreme modesty I mean Modesty in many areas of life where it seems  modesty would not be required or to be excessive
Nietzsche said that  Christians suffer from extreme piety but in my opinion it seems that  Some Protestants suffer from extreme modesty
Bare  in mind, you can be Culturally Protestant or Culturally from X  religion despite not being attending Church nor having a religious  belief
Just by virtue of being from that city or state
Some of these  examples might apply more to American culture by I have also seen a bit  of these modesty culture in Germany and the UK *My  argument is the following: It seems Catholic or former Catholic  countries have a concept of Sensuality this has to do with  expression and expressing yourself and feelings meanwhile it seems  in Protestants countries there seems to be modesty plus a concept of  embarassment *verlegenheit
Of  course, some people might say my examples are not strong enough but I  think they are a microcosm of a large structural culture which is  somewhat invisible unless you studying  in more depth: Calvinism,  Lutheranism and Evangelism Example #1(Concrete Example Say  you buy a nice shirt for yourself
It seems that some Protestants  will find it Pretentious
This could also be a English thing, like an  England vs France reason
But I have this type of talk in German as  well Example #2(Real example:Music There  was a Mexican Girl(Culturally Catholic) who gave Drake Bell a hug/kiss  and their English speaking audience, was shocked
They said, Where are  your morals
Or Why is she so shameless
Example # 3(Real Example:Television I  have been watching a lot of Italian television and noticed that the  character will say something
Then regret it and apologize
But they are  much more expressive of emotion
I heard the English Speaking  audience say they are Drama Queens Example #4(Real Example: Soccer The  American Soccer Coach wears a plain t-shirt
While many of the Soccer  Coaches in Europe wear suits
Now some people say that its his personal  choice
However, I believe he is Culturally Protestant since in a  previous thread some of you said Protestants shun upon wearing  ostentatious clothes since its draws your attention away from God Example #5(Celebrity Culture Emma  Watson and many other celebrities are always trying to be modest, even  to the point where it sounds unrealistic
Some people said that audience  will dislike them if they started giving more honest answers Example #6(Conversations Closely  related to #5, I noticed that in France and Italy people talk more  about Intellectual topics and you can name dropped thinkers
While in  the Protestant countries this would be unfriendly and pretentious
I  am still studying German Culture in more depth hence, I can't guarantee  it happens there as well but I have see it in the English Speaking  Countries Conclusion :  There are just a few examples, I could go on and on
But you guys get  the idea
wonder if there's someone who has written about this topic in depth It seem Some Protestants suffer from extreme modesty
Requirement to be a Muslim: Recite the shahada What is the shahada: Allah is the only God and Muhammad is his Prophet (obviously the original shahada is in Arabic Muhammad did a lot of things we consider immoral by modern Western standards
I will list them out below for clarity Things that are okay according to Muhammad, but not okay according to modern Western values: marrying a child or anyone more than 30 years younger than you (since ofc there will be Muslims here citing the unbacked sources of Aisha being 17, as if that's perfectly okay by modern western values when Muhammad was minimum 50 at the time), killing people for leaving Islam, not allowing people to be involved with politics/ decision making if they are not Muslim, having multiple wives (but not multiple husbands), having slaves The Quran doesn't have a time limit
It doesn't say after 500 years, use the modern cultural values
It doesn't say if Muhammad and your culture don't align, then make sure to use your own culture, because Muhammad may have lived a long time ago
Instead, it says Muhammad is the FINAL prophet, and his message is the FINAL message of God
If you choose western values over Muhammad's message, you are not a Muslim
Only the extremists are real Muslims, because only they truly follow the shahada
Reject Muhammad as Prophet = not a Muslim, by any definition of the word Also, notice that none of this is addressing what is actually right in an objective sense
The moral relativist trolls can hold their horses
I am not saying if it is good or bad to be Muslim or not, just that Islam is fundamentally incompatible with modern western values, and if you are prioritizing modern western values over Muhammad, then you cannot be a Muslim
Whether that is good or bad, or if the western values are wrong, is up to you [As an aside, the Persians and Byzantines that were Muhammad's contemporaries punished pedophiles
Pedophilia being gross is not new
Saying pedophilia was okay 1300 years ago because Muhammad did it is like saying slavery is okay today because Qatar is doing it
Islam had outdate morals from its very inception, but that's not directly relevant to my main thesis
I just felt like I had to include it
You cannot be a Muslim if you say that it is unfair to judge Mohammed by modern standards
Everything the Bible deems as sinful or wicked is simply biological, neurological, chemical and physiological processes deeply coded in our DNA and biomass, and the spectrum of humanity is too vast and complex to put people in one of two boxes, damned or saved
(This also applies to Abrahamic religion in general, and most worldwide religions) Tribalism is a prominent reason why what the Bible regards as evil and bad is simply just nonsensical defamation of the human being
As humans, we collaborate and cooperate, but also challenge each other and compete against one another
There is nothing in the entirety of human history dating back to the origin of human existence that suggests we were ever anything different, or that we are destined to become one with an external, supernatural being that has the ability to collect our souls and transfer us into another realm entirely, on the condition that we pledged our utmost unquestioning and unadulterated obedience and submission to that supreme entity The reality of human nature is slandered by the Bible and Christianity itself as a way to exercise control and power over the common population, where critical thinking was underdeveloped, education was scarce, and superstition and ignorance was at the forefront of the majority of people in Biblical times, especially regarding the history and culture of the stories depicted Lying, stealing, cheating, hating, murdering (and don't forget mass fucking and orgies) . .
other animals, namely mammals (which human beings would be categorized as if we were put in the same box under the same labels as the animal kingdom) are capable of doing all of those things, and there is no evidence to suggest otherwise Animals are also capable of altruism, self-sacrifice and teamwork, something which humans would highly regard and value as honorable and noble
What a human being would consider as having integrity and honesty, is really just in the grand scheme of things a survival mechanism Human beings work better together, than against each other, and that's that
There is also no proof nor evidence to suggest that the god depicted in the Abrahamic religions, namely Christianity, is anything more than an abstract concept formulated as an extension of mankind that showcases their narcissism, entitlement and desire to exercise power and control with others
The idea that Christianity is somehow different and is relationship with God instead of just any mere religion is also just mere delusion and coping mechanism that assists believers with getting through life TL;DR Human beings are painted as terrible beings in the Bible and Christianity even though it makes no sense to put them down as such because they are no different than the other living beings on the planet The reality of human nature is slandered by Christianity and the Bible itself
A thoughtful theist asked me, a scientist: If you don't believe in God, then how do you think all this got here? And without God, how can we know how to behave? While I don't claim to have all the answers, and I know that others have given better answers that I, the question was asked of me, so I felt compelled to try to give a thoughtful response, based on first principles
My goal is not to demean or to change anyone's mind, but to help a thoughtful theist come to understand and respect a scientific perspective
Here is what came to mind. .  Part 1
Where did we come from Where did we come from? First, let’s admit that nobody knows
How do we come to know anything? Oftentimes, it’s by reasoning about observations
So, let’s start with one of the simplest observations
It appears that there is something rather than nothing
Planets, trees, paperclips, and we ourselves appear to be here
Most of us agree with this observation, and if we didn’t, there’d be nothing to explain, so for sake of conversation, let’s assume for now that we do in fact exist Supposing stuff does exist, it seems reasonable to ask how it got here - where did it come from? The fact that we think an explanation is needed here implies that we all share a certain idea of what counts as a good explanation
Oil and vinegar is a good explanation for salad dressing; eating soap is a good explanation for getting sick; and the idea that the world is round is a good explanation for how a traveler moving in any straight line will eventually arrive where she started But it’s easy to imagine how things could have been different
Salad dressing could have been made from other ingredients; the kid who ate soap might have already been sick from a stomach flu; and the world could have been more ovular in shape
So the fact that we think explanations are needed implies that certain things do demand explanation
And the fact that some explanations are better than others implies that we all have certain standards for what counts as a good explanation Let’s explore some possible explanations for all this stuff in our world
First, it could be that it all came from nothing
But this seems like a pretty unsatisfying explanation because it doesn’t actually explain anything
How exactly could something come from nothing? In ordinary life, we have no single example of anything ever having come from nothing, and if it did, we’d have no natural explanation for how it did that, or how we could make it happen again
Even on the quantum scale, where photons appear to come from nowhere, we have no current explanation for how this happens
If we conclude that it happens as the result of supernatural forces, we haven’t explained anything
We’ve just put a label on a mystery
But just because we don’t know the explanation doesn’t mean it can’t be explained one day according to natural laws
There are innumerable examples in history of solving mysteries in this way If we were to conclude that something came from nothing, then our definition of nothing must be wrong because if something came from it, then it wasn’t really nothing to begin with
That’s just true by definition
Since, to our best knowledge, something can’t literally come from absolutely nothing, maybe the stuff of this world has always only ever come from other stuff
Something can surely come from something else
Of course, this explanation might not be immediately satisfying because it implies an infinite regress of causes - a cosmic passing of the buck
We have an intuition that there must be a first cause - the original stuff
The problem is that if there is a first cause, we’re right back at square one, looking for an explanation for that stuff It’s in situations like these that we should reflect on our assumptions and whether they could be wrong
For one, maybe there are mysteries that our minds can’t solve
Maybe the world is here because of supernatural forces, and maybe we can call that God, and we’ll take it on faith that God is the first cause
Ok, but if we think this, we’ve drastically lowered our bar for what counts as a good explanation
By lowering the bar to that degree, we’re forced to contend with innumerable other explanations for existence, like that the universe was born from Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, or the flying spaghetti monste , or on the back of a turtl , as some religions teach
Taking things on faith unfortunately opens us up to believe all kinds of fictions and falsehoods, making it impossible to tell truth from fiction
This is fine only if you think the search for truth is completely meaningless So, if we stand by the premise that something can’t ultimately come from nothing, then maybe there’s a flaw in our assumption that there must be a first cause
If something always comes from something else, why does that strike us as a bad explanation? I suspect the answer has to do with the great difficulty human minds have trying to understand the meaning of the concepts nothing and the infinite
All along we’ve been assuming that nothing means there is objectively nothing present, and infinity refers to something that is objectively endless
We think of them as polar opposites
But how can we be sure these characterizations are true? No scientist has ever successfully observed absolute nothingness or absolute infinity
In fact, scientists who have attempted to take measurements of nothing (that is, a vacuum) have found quite the opposite of nothing: their measurements reveal that vacuums have energetic state
So nothing and infinity have something interesting in common
When we try to describe them at the elemental level, we can describe them both as energetic states
Nothing and infinity are also both believed to be homogenous states, meaning that each one can be understood in some sense as uniform
There’s an adage that fish will be the last to discover water
This is an apt analogy here because it shows how one and the same substance can be perceived as both vast and absent, depending on one’s point of view
Fish might not notice water because it uniformly permeates everything in their world, much like humans once believed that the air in our atmosphere is empty space; to a bird, of course, there is nothing empty about air In daily life, we think of nothing in an absolute sense because it appears to be empty, static, and uniform relative to our lived experience
But to mistake this state for truly nothing in an absolute sense just reveals our own bias - much like we conceive of the earth as being motionless
From a broader perspective, it can only be described as motionless relative to us This relational property of the universe means that nothing and infinity might not be polar opposites
Imagine a person who believes that the earth is flat and can’t conceive of it being any other way
If this person were to travel in a perfectly straight line, say, Eastward, along the equator, eventually they would return to their origin point
The flat earther would be astonished
In their mind, East and West are polar opposites
So, they might think they had traveled through a wormhole hole
Of course, we know that East and West are not strict opposites, and the traveler’s reappearing act can be easily explained by assuming the earth is spherical
But to achieve that understanding, we had to think in three dimensions instead of two
Likewise, the seemingly mysterious properties of nothingness and infinity could be an indication that they are not the polar opposites that they appear to be in our three-dimensional perspective, but are closely related properties of a higher-dimensional phenomenon The lesson here is that nothing and infinity could conceivably be, not absolute states, but relational states, two manifestations of a single fundamental entity
If emptiness and infinity are ultimately manifestations of the same thing, then it’s meaningless to ask what caused stuff to come into being because, at the most fundamental level that we can comprehend, something has always been there
It’s the changes in that cosmic stuff, the temporary perturbations that, like waves on the ocean’s surface, form the relational states that we know as life It’s a bewildering thought
And I'm the first to admit that I have no idea what lies beyond our three-dimensional existence
But should our bewilderment serve as evidence that the universe must have been created by God? I don’t think so because, as discussed above, attributing creation to God is no more explanatory than attributing it to a spaghetti monster, and more importantly, because there might be no first cause as we understand it
So whether God exists or not, the explanation for our universe remains mysterious, at least for the foreseeable future
In the meantime, we have a choice: we can take that mystery on faith, or we can study it, measure it, test it, challenge and revise our own assumptions until we achieve, however slightly, a richer understanding of this amazing world we live in Part 2
How should we behave Holding aside questions about the nature of the universe, there remains a more practical question
If God doesn’t exist,  how can we all get along? How would we agree on what is good? To whom would we hold ourselves accountable These are difficult questions, and I won’t pretend to have all the right answers
But there’s reason to believe that it’s not a lost cause
Denying the belief in God does not necessitate a world of chaos, selfishness, violence, and debauchery
The challenge is this: to develop systems of cooperation that sustain themselves on the basis of rules that are likely to be honored by individuals with competing interests
One way to approach this challenge is to study, scientifically, what sorts of systems of cooperation work better than others But first, why should we cooperate in the first place? If God doesn’t exist, what would motivate us to play nice? One motivation could be that it feels good to be nice
But that’s a hard sell because sometimes it also feels good to be selfish, so this makes it hard to know when to follow which motivation
Another motivation could be that it’s ultimately in our best interest to make sacrifices now for greater gains later
For example, forgoing a paycheck now to finish a high-school education could help a graduate cultivate the skills and resources they need to earn a larger paycheck later and serve both themselves and their community in a more effective way
Giving up drinking now could help someone be a better parent, which in turn will tend to help to raise a healthier, more virtuous child, and thus a healthier future relationship that benefits both parties much more than the instant gratification that alcohol could bring
But for such a motivation to be adopted, people really need to believe it, and to really believe it, it needs to usually prove itself true
So a good system of rules is one that delivers on its promises Many religious traditions would claim to meet this definition
They are systems of rules that purport that good things will come to those who follow their rules
This is essentially what the Golden Rule is all about, which is foundational to so many religions and non-religious traditions
But does the Golden Rule always deliver on its promises? Of course not
It’s just a rule of thumb
So how do we get people to follow the rule when it doesn’t deliver? Many religions try to do that through faith; Others through authority; Others through ritual
Many of these great efforts to get people to follow the rules have won the hearts of particular individuals
But none of them have won the hearts of all mankind
I think this is because, for some people to be adequately motivated, they require stronger evidence that the rules will tend to deliver on their promises
For many people, that means discovering a set of rules that generate payoffs in this lifetime So, how can we discover such a set of rules? The scientific method suggests that we should be able to discover such rules through the systematic observation of our own world—that’s the only place we can observe after all
One starting point might be to observe the people for whom the rules are clearly not working: the downtrodden, who have labored hard each day simply for a roof over their head and a meal in their belly, and still have nothing to show for it
The sinners, who abuse others for personal gratification
Maybe instead of promising them reward or punishment in the afterlife and expecting them to take it on faith, it behooves us to help them identify the future payoffs of good behavior in this life
To do that, we need to study what’s failing them
Is it a systemic, economic problem, like the lack of mechanisms for upward mobility? Is it the lack of mental health resources necessary to persist in the face of these obstacles? A combination? There may be hundreds, or thousands, of barriers to thriving, and the prevalence of these societal problems is evidence that much more work is needed to be done to identify the changes to the rulebook that are needed to promote thriving
Instead of expecting the faithless to take it on faith, we could try to find a way to give them something they have reason to believe in
So, what should motivate us to play nice without God? A constructed system of rules that can consistently prove its own worth to ordinary people Even if there are good reasons to play nice without God, how can we go about doing it? If one person thinks it’s good to steal and another does not, how can we decide who’s right without appealing to a higher authority? Again, this is a hard question, and we don’t have all the answers yet
But a partial answer is that stealing is wrong to the extent that we can consistently demonstrate situations in which individuals who forgo stealing from one another both do better in the long run
What counts as doing better is largely self-evident and already agreed on by theists and non-theists alike, like having consistent access to food, shelter, social support, etc.
In this framework, studying the social rules and mechanisms that best facilitate such outcomes is a rational act of service If we don’t know whether God exists, wouldn’t it be more rational to assume he does exist and be wrong than to assume he does not exist and be wrong? In this view, if he does exist, the faithless will suffer eternal damnation, whereas if he doesn’t, the faithful will have forgone only some minor inconveniences in this life
This idea is known as Pascal’s Wager, named after the 17th-Century French theologian who made a rational argument for believing in God
It would be a compelling argument if we had absolute uncertainty about whether God exists or not
If we had absolutely no idea either way—that is, if our odds of being wrong were 50/50—then eternal damnation surely does seem the one to avoid
But here’s the catch: our uncertainty about God’s existence is not 50/50
We have vast libraries of scientific knowledge about how matter behaves and the rules of what can cause what
So far, virtually all of it has been explained without positing the existence of God - all except for the first cause - but as we discussed above, positing that God exists does not actually help to explain that
So given that the existence of God defies probability, it turns out that believing he does not exist is not a very big risk after all.  Consider driving a car.  Driving has inherent risks
The cost of getting in a serious car accident while driving to the grocery store on a given day is certainly worse than the cost of not driving to the store that day
And if the odds of getting into an accident were 50/50, it would indeed be rational to stay home and order your groceries online, even if that’s more expensive in the short term
But the odds of getting into a car accident on a given day are not 50/50, and we know this from hard data
The risk is not zero, but it’s small enough that we could justifiably conclude that driving to the grocery store is worth the risk
The same is true for the belief in God
Does this rational case for denying the existence of God mean we should abandon all social rules governing human behavior? Only if you have no other reason for being good
But as we have discussed, we have other good reasons for being good Most of us are seekers of truth, but we vary in our standards of proof for deciding what’s true
Those who adopt a scientific perspective are not ready to give up on natural explanations because, over the long term, their approach has an unsurpassed track record
This is because they commit themselves to an extremely high standard of proof
Their approach is not a quick fix - it’s a slow and laborious process
But even if they fail to answer the biggest questions in the end, their efforts will not be in vain because their journey can only bring us closer
Anyone who cares about truth should find comfort in this Postscript: I'm happy to concede that I could be wrong about all of this
If, one day, God appears to me to invalidate my views, I'm willing to stand corrected
That’s the beauty of the scientific perspective - it’s amenable to revision and improvement
But he'd have his work cut out for him because, to persuade a scientist of an extraordinary claim, one must have extraordinary evidence
Mere voices and miracles are not enough since those can likely be explained as hallucinations or illusions
Instead, God would have to prove his existence to us using scientific standards or else prove why our standards are wrong
Since the only way to verify the truth of a proposition is through a combination of observation and reason, then I have to expect God, like any meaningful phenomenon, to be observable and reasonable, and if he is not, I cannot be expected to find truth in God
So I have no worries about eternal damnation
If God is the all-good, all-knowing, all-powerful figure some think he is, then when my time of reckoning comes, he will not damn me for this stance on life
If anything, he may reward me for it because defending a high standard of truth in a world full of doubt is a greater act of service than mere faith alone
If he meets these high standards or proves to me why they are wrong, only then will I believe in him
That’s a risk I’m willing to take I don't expect all readers to agree with me about all this
And I still think individuals can lead a good life without enlisting in the scientific worldview
Not everyone needs to be guided by that view, just like not everyone needs to be a plumber
But it's a good thing that we have plumbers
And for those of us who are not, it behooves us to learn a thing or two about how a toilet works
After all, it could save our ass someday The universe is a clogged toilet, science is the plumber, and God is MIA.
Before I explain that Christians cannot agree about what their scriptures are, I will explain why their failure to agree is devastating to Christian authority
Christian authority is based upon its scriptures
Christianity, as defined by its scriptures, claims that its scriptures were written by YHWH and are suitable guidance for Christians (2 Timothy 3:16)
Christians refer to their scriptures as the word of god and similar terms
If the Christians' scriptures were truly written by YHWH and Christians were guided by YHWH, then they would be easily able to distinguish YHWH's scriptures from lesser writings
After all, YHWH, according to the Christians' scriptures, cannot lie (Titus 1:2, Hebrews 6:18)
But Christians cannot agree about what constitutes their scriptures, which in turn suggests that YHWH's alleged wisdom and writing cannot easily be distinguished from human writings - in turn undermining the justification for trusting the Christians' scriptures as special and worthy of trust by Christians because they were written by YHWH The Roman Catholics add to the scriptures used by Protestants the following texts: Tobit, Judith, portions of Esther, 1 Maccabees, 2 Maccabees, Wisdom of Solomon, Ecclesiasticus (also known as Sirach), Baruch, Letter of Jeremiah, The Prayer of Azariah and Song of the Three Holy Children to the Book of Daniel, the story of Susanna to the Book of Daniel, and the story of Bel and the Dragon to the Book of Daniel The Eastern Orthodox churches have added the following texts in addition to what the Roman Catholics have added: 3 Maccabees, 4 Maccabees (Georgian church only), 1 Esdras, 2 Esdras (Georgian church only), Odes, Psalm 151, Psalms 152-155 (Syriac Peshitta only), Baruch 2 (Syriac Peshitta only), and the Prayer of Manasseh The Ethiopian Orthodox add the following texts in addition to the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Texts: Books of Enoch, Book of Jubilees, Rest of the Words of Baruch (aka Paralipomena of Baruch), 1 Meqabyan, 2 Meqabyan, 3 Meqabyan And in the past, Christians have had even stranger conflicts about which texts should be regarded as scripture
For example, a text claiming to be Paul's Epistle to the Laodiceans was included in some early Latin texts of the New Testament, and was cited by Pope Gregory the Great and included in John Wycliffe's translation, but Jerome and many others believed it to be a forgery - which modern Christianity agrees with even as it agrees about little else
Yet a Pope thought otherwise The Christian, noting my flair, may assert that Buddhism is no better with its Mahayana and Tantric scriptures, to say nothing of its treasure texts - which are and have been condemned by Buddhists from various sects as forgeries
But such a claim would not address my argument in this post Edited in order to add: My argument in this thread is not about when texts were added or removed, but rather about how different Christian denominations have different scriptures
used the Protestant Christian scriptures and the concept of other denominations adding to their scriptures not because was claiming that other sects literally added to Protestant scriptures but in order to more effectively convey how Protestant Christian Scriptures, far from being universally accepted among Christians as complete, are base to which other Christian sects have added texts The fact that Christians could not and cannot agree about what works belong within their scriptures is devastating to claims for Christian authority.
Introduction Greetings, Religion Debate Reddit
It has been quite some time since my last pos on here
Today, I briefly return with some reflections on a few relatively recent theodicies, I've come across that I think are difficult to respond to
What is a theodicy? To understand this, we will first need an understanding of the problem of evil The problem of evil is an argument for the non-existence of God which starts with some facts or observations, of evil, or suffering we see in the world
Be it the occurrence of evil and suffering generally, or more concrete horrific examples of evil or suffering such as a Fawn burning to death in a forest fire
There is taken to be two kinds of problem of evil
An evidentia , and a logica version
A logical problem of evil, argues that theism and the occurrence of evil are jointly inconsistent
The basic form of such an argument would be as follows If evil exists, then it's not the case that God exist Evil exist Therefore it's not the case that God exist An evidential problem of evil on the other hand, argues that the occurrence of the evil we see (Usually, in particular, horrendous, seemingly gratuitous suffering) is highly unlikely on theism
That is, that given the truth of theism, antecedently, it would be very surprising if it turned out there were evils of the sort we observe in this world
There are many ways to formulate such an argument that atheist philosophers have come up with, there are inductive formulations, intuition-based formulations, Bayesian formulations etc
Here is a basic evidential argument from evil If God exists, then gratuitous evil does not exis Probably, gratuitous evil exist Therefore, probably, God does not exis Gratuitous evil being evil with no morally justifying reason for it's existence There are two ways theists tend to respond to the problem of evil
One would be a defense, another would be a theodicy
A defense is a response to a logical problem of evil, it is a story one can tell, which, when conjoined with theism, makes theism and the existence of evil compossible
The most famous example is Alvin Plantinga's free will defens
It's important to note that, a defense, does not need to be remotely likely, or plausible, it only needs to be true for all one knows and not entail a logical contradiction A theodicy, on the other hand, is a response to the evidential problem of evil
It is a story which is taken to be both plausible given the truth of theism, and when added to theism, makes the occurrence of the evils we see unsurprising from a probabilistic standpoint
Unlike a defense, a theodicy must be a story which is plausibly actually true, not just true for all one knows
To be a successful theodicy, much more is needed then mere logical coherence since what needs to be shown is not merely that theism is consistent with evil, but that there is no significant evidential tension between theism and observations of evil
A standard example of a theodicy is John Hick's soul-making theodic
We will not be discussing the soul-making theodicy today
Instead, I will be addressing more obscure, non-traditional theodicies, that have been discussed on the philosophically sophisticated theist side of YouTube
It is to this, that I now turn The Non-Identity Theodic The first theodicy I will examine is the non-identity theodicy
Before reading this section, I highly recommend watching Apologetic Squared's short 7 minute vide on this theodicy or reading the original pape on it
I will just give a brief sketch of it The basic idea is this; what makes me, me, and you, you, is our essential properties
And, the story goes, our essential properties include (and are possibly exhausted by) facts about our origins, indeed very specific facts about our origins, including the total causal history which has resulted in ones coming-to-be, our ancestral history, and evolutionary history
But this history includes a lot of suffering
So, God permits this suffering to bring about you, and me, that is you and me in particular
If God did not allow such suffering, then you wouldn't exist, rather someone else would, with some other set of essential properties
God's intention is to bring about us in particular, you, me, Jim and Bob across the street, etc
He views bringing about us in particular, as a valuable end in itself, such that the means he uses to achieve such an end, which includes vast amounts of horrific suffering, makes it all worthwhile!  We will now turn our attention to the objections Objection 1 The non-identity theodicy requires the truth of origin essentialism
This seems reasonably plausible on it's own
It seems like, at least partly, what would make me numerically distinct from an identical clone of myself would be my origins
Perhaps my clone was created in a test-tube using my DNA, whereas I was created through regular human reproduction etc
So my origins are an essential property of me, if those weren't my origins, I wouldn't be me
The problem is, the theodicy is more radical, it requires that the entire causal history prior to my coming-to-be, including facts about suffering that do not seem to have any relevant causal connection to my origins, are essential to me
This strikes me as unintuitive in the extreme
While an object like you are me, could not have a entirely different origin, it seems like we could have a slightly different origin
That is, it seems like some degree of modal tolerance is permissable
Suppose I didn't believe my great grandfather fought in the first world war, but then my father tells me he did
It doesn't seem, in the slightest, that I'm learning about who I am, that is, learning about my essential characteristics
Or that, if it later turned out my grandfather did not fight in WW1, I would be finding out that I'm a different person than I previously thought I was, that seems utterly bizarre
On the other hand, if I found out that I am a brain in a vat, or a clone created in a test-tube, it seems like I would indeed be shocked to find out that I am not who I thought I was! But then, if not every fact about our origins is essential, what facts are and aren't? On reflection, one answer with some plausibility, is the essential part of my origin is the event of my father's sperm fertilizing my mother's egg, and the set of pre-natal embryonic states which followed etc
That is, what is relevent to an object or persons origins, is the causal history of the material out of which it was originally constituted
What makes the desk on which I am typing, *this* desk, is the history of the wood and nails which constitutes it
A view such as this is often used in tandum with Kripke's causal theory of reference
For a technical paper on this see her But suppose we even grant (as I would not) that every state of affairs which forms part of the causal chain ultimately leading to my birth, stretching back even to specific facts related to our evolutionary history, are an essential part of my origins as the argument needs
There is now a further question
Why then, couldn't the events which feature creaturely suffering, have radically different psychophysical connections? Were there a God, He could have easily set it up so that basically all the physical events in the causal chain leading up to my and your creation are the same as they are in this world, but the sensations of pain experienced internally by the creatures and persons were not horrifically agonizing, or at least greatly less so
So your origin and my origin is surely the same or same enough, our existence/essential properties would be preserved
Yet, the extremely undesirable experiences felt by persons and sentient non-persons leading up to us, would be greatly diminished
Surely God could have, indeed, would have, actualized that world, and as far as this theodicy goes, it appears to be left a mystery as to why He did not The theodicist might conceivably respond, that actually if God were to change the psychophysical laws, He would have to change the physical events, since those phenomenal states, necessarily supervene on those physical states
But, for one this is highly implausible on the theists own view, since presumably God has phenomenal states prior to the creation of any physical states, and for those who maintain an afterlife, humans as well can have phenomenal states despite no longer having a physical body
So, it would seem phenomenal content does not necessarily depend on certain physical states, you can have different phenomenal contents despite changes in physical states
Further, it seems like, in principle, an omnipotent God should be understood as having complete control over the causal laws factive to His creation
Finally, even if a change in the specific phenomenal contents like pain, entails a change in physical states, it seems like only minor changes, utterly irrelevant to our material origins are required
The theist would need to motivate the prima facie implausible claim that changes relevant to our material origins are required, that isn't just an ad hoc move to save the theodicy Scott Hill has a pape on the non-identity theodicy, where he attempts to motivate a radical origin essentialism
I will address this in turn Scott characterizes the origin essentialism he accepts as follows Assembly Origin Essentialism: If the materials from which a creature originated were assembled by a process that was too different, then that creature would not have existed
At first blush, there doesn't seem to be an issue
But, it is left ambiguous what is precisely meant by too different
Scott and I, are going to disagree on the threshold
Be that as it is, Scott gives 3 justifications for why an Assembly Origin Essentialism should be strong enough to motivate the non-identity theodicy My first argument is that intervening in the world in the ways described in Waiting and Painless Evolution constitutes changes that are too big
At most a proponent of Assembly Origin Essentialism should allow a few minor changes to the process by which the materials  from which I arose are assembled such as the one in Forbes' example
On the other hand,  the miracles required in Waiting and Painless Evolution require big changes to the process
So my origin is not preserved in such cases
What Scott seems to be imagining here is God constantly making significant interventions, and performing miracles
This, however, is not a requirement
As discussed above, God does not have to make significant interventions, indeed, it doesn't seem like God has to intervene at all, He could have set it up so, prior to the initiation of the given causal chain, the events in the causal chain qua creaturely suffering, are linked up with less horrifically painful phenomenal states, or there are different psychophysical laws of nature
Otherwise, God could make small adjustments, so that the history of the materials leading to me, or you, are the same or similar enough, but there isn't such a frequency, intensity, and distribution, of horrific suffering among persons and non-persons
Afterall, it doesn't seem like a T-Rex mauling a Brochosaurus alive, or even my mother's pre-birth agony, is absolutely necessary for me, or Bob's, or anybody elses origins
The material out of which we originated could have an identical, or, intuitively, an identical enough history, such that I am still me and you are still you, sans such horrors
But even if we grant that God needs to make really major changes or interventions, it just needs to be logically actualizable that, in light of such major changes which are minimally sufficient to prevent horrific suffering, the history of our material origins could still be similar enough so that we would still exist
This seems logically possible, and since it seems logically possible, it seems like a state of affairs which God can actualize
So there are further burden-shifting grounds to reject Scott's claim My second argument is that accepting such a strong variant of origin essentialism yields a gain in explanatory power. .
adopting a version of origin essentialism that rules out Waiting and Painless Evolution forms part of a theodicy that explains why God allows evil
That is a significant gain in explanatory power for the theist
I just have a couple points here
For one, it's debatable whether the non-identity theodicy does have such explanatory power, I've already offered a couple reasons to think it does not, and I will provide more reasons
For two, even if adopting such a view does explain the occurrence of evils under the truth of theism, as a non-theist, I do not grant that this is a gain in explanatory power tout court My third argument is that adopting such a strong version of origin essentialism eliminates vagueness. .
There seems to be no principled way to say when an origin becomes so different that it fails to preserve the existence of an organism other than never or always
And if we are antecedently attracted to Assembly Origin Essentialism, it isn’t plausible to hold that a change in origin never yields a different organism
So we should say that any change at all in the process by which the materials of my origin were assembled yields a different mere duplicate of me rather than me
This argument has more bite than the other two, but I think it is defeasible
I agree that if you hold that any change whatsoever in the causal history of ones origins is a change in the essential properties of some object or organism then that does indeed eliminate vagueness and arbitrariness, and, prima facie, this does seem to be a problem for views which are restrictive
But, so too would positing that having any strands of hair, constitutes non-baldness, or positing that any collection of 2 or more grains of sand constitutes a pile
We have an intuitive, conventional understanding of what a pile is, and what non-baldness is, and these views, while having the virtue of eliminating vagueness, simply do not track our concepts
This is analogous to radical origin essentialism, it simply doesn't track my, and I think our shared intuitive understanding of what makes us, us, and I take myself to have illustrated why this is so, above
If vagueness is a cost of maintaining such a view, then it's one I gladly pay, with the hopes that one day we do discover a restrictive criterion for essentiality of origins, which avoids issues of vague predicates Objection 2 Suppose we forgo the first objection, and agree that a very radical kind of origin essentialism is true
Even so, I believe the plausibility of the theodicy is parasitic upon a subtle sort of equivocation
It rests on the intuition that the existence of you, and you in particular, your mother and father, your best friends and the love of your life, and those people in the actual world who satisfy those descriptions in particular are valuable in themselves, for their own sake
But suppose I asked you what makes them valuable, or at least, why you value them so dearly
Plausibly, you'd list out the set of things they've done for you, the bad times they were there to help you get through, the virtues and other admirable qualities they embody, possibly some physical features if you know what I mean
Among other things in that ballpark
It would be very odd for you to list off a specific set of essential properties related to their origins like that a great ape was eaten alive by an alligator billions of years ago
In fact, if you were to do that, I'd probably try to contact a mental health clinician
What this tells me is, while it can be granted that there are essential properties related to my origins that make me, me, rather than someone else
These essential features are, in fact, accidental if we zoom out and ask what stands in the right sort of making-relation in terms of my value properties
If God, in creating, was aiming towards some highly specific set of essential characteristics and in doing so actualizing states of affairs that are technically necessary to make us who we are, rather than the second order goods that plausibly make us valuable, then it seems like God's intentions are not contrastively, aimed at the right sort of end A proponent of the theodicy might be tempted to argue, that actually, there is nothing further that makes me valuable, it is irreducible
I'm not valuable in virtue of exemplifying certain goods, I'm just valuable as such
Even this, however, won't do
If the value is irreducible, then God could have actualized such irreducible value properties without actualizing my origins
What's needed, is that there are irreducible value properties which somehow necessarily supervene on states of affairs related to my origins
So what makes me valuable, is my essential properties qua my origins
This again, just doesn't appear plausible on reflection and would need to be motivated But even if it is motivated, there is of course an issue of whether the value of contrastively actualizing me, rather than a qualitatively identical counterpart with a different origin that doesn't involve as much horrific suffering, is so great that it outweighs the aforementioned horrific suffering which was permitted
This, of course, is even more implausible
Granted, Vince Vitale, and Scott Hill, for this reason seem to grant that this theodicy doesn't do the work on it's own, but rather only when supplemented with the fact that creaturely evils will be defeated in an afterlife
More on this later Objection 3 The last objection I will present will be an undercutting one, from Kantian (or other deontological) duties
The theodicy seems to be motivated by a kind of deontology, wherein God is permitting creaturely suffering for the sake of creating me, and you, whom are ends in themselves, in the Kantian sense
In actuality though, this theodicy is the furthest thing from an endorsement of Kantian ethics, and is in fact radically consequentialist
What God is doing, according to the non-identity theodicy, is permitting the agonizing suffering, death, violation of autonomy and destruction of faculties, of billions of rational agents, and non-rational sentient agents, as a mere means to a heteronomous end
That is, he treats rational agents as a mere means to bring about other rational agents with certain essential traits, He fails to treat rational agents as ends in themselves
No contemporary Kantian in the known universe would find such actions tolerable, and Kant himself would most likely be rolling in his grave
As a related point, even  the vast majority of consequentialists would find the kind of normative framework this theodicy requires implausible in the extreme
It's not like God is maximizing pleasure, or happiness, or any metric of utility consequentialists would find plausible, rather he permits horrors just to bring about specific persons with specific essential characteristics In light of these objections, while this theodicy is an interesting and unique piece of philosophy, I cannot find it plausible, as even a partial justification of the evil we see The Participation Theodic The next theodicy I will be examining is one created by a catholic self-proclaimed twitter apologist John Buc
Do not get the wrong impression though, he is not a pushover like his description implies and his participation theodicy is a clever one
Here is a pape he wrote on the theodicy, and here is a recent discussio he had on it with an atheist Youtuber To briefly summarize, atheists will often present the problem of evil by arguing that God would create a perfect, one might say heavenly world, and we are not in such a world
The participation theodicy starts by granting that the best thing God can do is actualize an ideal world
But, it would be better for God, to use Alvin Plantinga's jargon, not to strongly actualize such a world, that is actualize it with His own power, from the get-go
But to weakly actualize it, by allowing that free creatures participate in the actualization of an ideal world
The catch being, for free creatures to participate in the creation of the ideal world, the world must start out non-ideal, indeed it might start out in the very notably far from ideal situation we find ourselves, with great amounts of creaturely suffering
But God is justified in permitting such suffering, because it is an all-things-considered good that an ideal world is brought about, by virtue of the creative participation of free agents, rather than an act of God's will alone Before we start with objections a few things are worth noting regarding the theodicy
The first is that it avoids a lot of the pitfalls of most other responses to the problem of evil, such as moral paralysis, the existence of apparently gratuitous evils, explanations for natural evils or animal suffering,  why a better state of affairs was not actualized etc
It is not without issues, but it is I think a quite impressive feature that it is able to sidestep many of the traditional problems that other theodicies run afoul of
The next is that, the theodicy has a lot in common with free will theodicies
While, it's admittedly better than any free will theodicy I've encountered, and doesn't suffer from some of the same issues, I think it does inherit some of it's follies
The last is, while it doesn't suffer from many of the same issues of other theodicies, it does suffer from a common issue that I call the issue of counterbalancing evils
The participation theodicy requires the intuition that God letting creatures actualize an ideal world is a greater good than God actualizing it Himself from the get-go, this intuition is not widely held
But even if you do share the intuition, it's surely not so strong that God's contrastively actualizing the world where creatures participate in the creation of the ideal world rather than God Himself creating the ideal world, is enough to outweigh the horrors we see
This is especially clear when we reflect on particularly horrific evils like a baby's being born with butterfly disease to live a short earthly life of nothing but pure agony
The intuition pump John uses, to motivate the theodicy, wrt a husband allowing his children to participate in making the wifes breakfast (See his pape for more details) simply does not work for horrendous suffering
However, it may still be that the participation theodicy can be a partial justification and form part of a cumulative case against the problem of evil in conjunction with other partial justifications
My objections will attempt to undermine the participation theodicy as a partial justification Objection 1 The first objection I will present is I think probably the most common sense one, and one that Buck is familiar with
In order for the theodicy to be successful, it must be true, or at least plausible, that the actions of free creatures are tending toward the actualization of an ideal world
The problem being, this just doesn't seem to be plausible based on the evidence we have
In some ways, we have made substantive moral progress, technological progress, medical progress etc
but in many other ways things seem to be getting worse
Shootings in the US as of late are at an all-time high, global starvation is (almost) as bad as it's ever been, as is the horrors of factory farming and global predation, a certain party in the US is increasingly more deranged, we have the invasion of Ukraine, and the Isreali-Palestine conflict neither of which seem to be generally improving etc
We don't seem to be seeing a general trajectory towards an ideal state of affairs . _1W1pLIfaIb8rYU6YeTdAk6{margin-right:6px}. _1H6Meh6ZAemKxOJDOEasfK{border-radius:50%;box-sizing:border-box;height:20px;margin-left:-8px;width:20px}. _1H6Meh6ZAemKxOJDOEasfK:first-child{margin-left:0}. _30vlMmCcnqKnXP1t-fzm0e{display:inline-block;margin-left:-8px;position:relative}
This is a simple argument against Messianic Judaism showing that it is entirely Christian and not a form of Judaism
Theologicall : Christian, not Jewish
Messianic institutions advocate for Trinitarianism
Trinitarianism is a Christian invention not supported by Jewish tradition or the Tanakh
The Christian ideas of the Incarnation and hypostatic union are similarly not supported by Judaism
Judaism teaches that God is one and not a man
Judaism also teaches that the messiah will be a man, not an incarnation of God
Worshipping a man or the Trinity is considered idolatry (avodah zarah) in Judaism
Messianic acceptance of these doctrines places them outside the acceptable boundaries of Judaism
Messianic appeals to the Tanakh on these points are irrelevant, which is explained in the next section Scripturall : Christian, not Jewish
In addition to accepting the Christian new testament, Messianics also adhere to the Protestant doctrine of Sola Scriptura: the idea that the Christian Bible is the sole and infallible source of authority for faith and practice
There are problems with both of these facts
First, the new testament is fundamentally opposed to Judaism and deeply antisemitic
For example, it teaches that the Torah is a curse, advocates disregard for Torah observance, and refers to Jews as children of the devil (and much more)
No movement that accepts the new testament can be considered legitimately Jewish for these reasons More importantly, the reliance on Sola Scriptura demonstrates the Protestant nature of this movement
Neither Judaism nor Catholicism accept this idea, instead understanding that scripture is in need of interpretation through a legitimate chain of authority
For a Christian example of the need for interpretation, take the theology of communion
At the Last Supper, Jesus states This is my body. .
This is my blood in reference to the bread and wine
Catholics claim this somewhat literally and hold the theology of transubstantiation, ie
that they are truly his body and blood at the Mass, while most Protestants take a more symbolic approach
The text is not clear one way or the other which theory is correct, and therefore needs an authoritative interpretation, which is provided by the churches
The same principle holds true for Judaism and the interpretation of the Torah Sola scriptura was a major innovation of the Protestant Revolution and is an entirely Christian idea
(In point of fact, sola scriptura is self-contradictory because Christian scriptures don't teach it
It is therefore a doctrine dependent on the authority of the church rather than scripture and ironically constitutes a Protestant version of an oral interpretive tradition
) In Judaism, the chain of authority is traced from the rabbis to Moses at Sinai and is referred to as the Oral Torah
The Oral Torah became the Mishnah and with its commentary the Gemarah is known as the Talmud
There is no Judaism without the Talmud
Messianics overwhelmingly reject the authority of the Talmud, halakha, and rabbis generally
Jewish interpretive tradition (Talmud and rabbis) is therefore replaced with the Protestant interpretive tradition (Christian-Bible-Alone Theory)
Messianic appeals to Christian interpretations of the Tanakh are therefore irrelevant for the support of their theological claims as a form of Judaism Rituall : Christian, not Jewish, but deceptively made to look Jewish
Jewish rituals and ritual items are symbolic expressions of the teachings of Judaism
Because Judaism and Christianity are theologically mutually exclusive, the meanings of these rituals and items must be altered by Messianics to express Christian doctrines
A prime example is the Passover Seder, which Messianics change to make about Jesus's last supper, death, and resurrection rather than the Exodus
In changing the meanings (and often the forms/practice) of these rituals and items, Messianics both disrespect and degrade them
Therefore, when Christians copy Jewish rituals or use ritual items, they become essentially non-Jewish because they have been ripped from their original context and altered It is also hypocritical of Messianics to adopt Jewish rituals and ritual items
Most of these things were either created or given form by the rabbis of the Talmud after the fall of the Temple, which of course happened after Jesus died
For example, the Passover Seder in its current form did not exist in the time of Jesus
Using these rituals and items that are based on rabbinic interpretation while selectively rejecting the authority of the rabbis on other things, e. g.  theology, is hypocritical
If they were consistent, they would rely on the teachings of the Bible alone, which would lead to some interesting, and probably laughable, results
However, the reason they do as they do is not because of a desire for consistent theology, but because of their mission to convert Jews
They know if they stray too far from the illusion of standard Jewish ritual, their form of Christianity would not appeal to Jews in the slightest
So, they adopt these rituals for the sake of proselytizing alone and making it appear as though one can convert to Christianity while maintaining a connection to Judaism Sociologicall : Christian, not Jewish
Many, if not most, members of Messianic churches are gentiles who never converted to Judaism
Of those few members who are ethnically Jewish (either totally or through one parent), they have ceased to practice Judaism, if they did to begin with, because of their conversion to Christianity
According to Jewish law, they are no longer part of the Jewish community and are treated as gentiles with regard to any religious issue
Food they prepare is not considered kosher, for example, and they cannot lead prayer in a synagogue, receive an aliyah, or even be counted in a minyan
They are effectively non-Jewish unless and until they repent and renounce Christianity
The only privilege they retain from their Jewish identity is that they are not required to undergo a conversion upon their return Messianics will often argue that this treatment is hypocritical because Jewish Buddhists and atheists, for example, are not treated the same way
Technically speaking, the same restrictions should apply in these situations, however, if the community is more lenient in these cases, it is for two specific reasons
1) Jewish Buddhists and atheists are not trying to convert Jews away from Judaism, and 2) they are not trying to dishonestly portray Buddhism or atheism as a fulfilled, completed, or more authentic form of Judaism
Furthermore, interest in and adoption of these worldviews are organic phenomena in the Jewish community, whereas Messianics are an intrusive, predatory, outside proselytizing phenomenon created by gentiles Messianics will also sometimes claim that if Judaism is a civilization or culture, as taught by Mordecai Kaplan, then their appropriation should be seen as legitimate
This is a misunderstanding of Kaplan
The transvaluation of sancta in Kaplan's theory must be based in the values and traditions of the Jewish community
Kaplan's understanding of God, for example, was a new theological position, but it was fundamentally grounded in the Jewish concept of God
Messianics, however, hold to evangelical theology in toto
It is not rooted in Judaism or Jewish culture, but is an entirely gentile Protestant creation
It therefore is not an example of the organic evolution of Jewish civilization, but is very obviously an imposition and attempt to convert Jews away from Judaism The claim that Christianity began as a Jewish sect is irrelevant to this issue
Christianity became a gentile religion almost immediately after the death of Jesus
By the time of Paul's letters, 20-30 years after Jesus, Christianity was overwhelmingly majority gentile
Christian theology regarding the Trinity and incarnation was a gentile creation, and much of their scriptures (e. g
the gospels and many of the epistles) were obviously written by gentiles unfamiliar with and/or hostile to Judaism
Christianity spent it's most formative first centuries defining itself against Judaism, and it's most influential theologians were not Jews (e. g.  Augustine, Origen, Tertullian, etc)
Christianity's development over the last two thousand years has been almost entirely in a gentile context, including the Protestant Revolution, which is the most important development for Messianics since their theology is entirely Evangelical Protestant in nature
Christianity is a gentile, not a Jewish creation, and therefore cannot be considered part of Kaplan's theory of Jewish civilization In Su : Messianics are Christians, not Jews in any relevant sense, and their religion is not Judaism
Theologically and scripturally, they are entirely Evangelical
Ritually, despite their appropriation of Jewish ceremonies and ritual items, they are Christian because of their alterations and reasons for doing them
Sociologically, they are mostly gentile Christians, and those who are ethnically Jewish have effectively become non-Jewish according to Jewish law because of their embrace of Christianity
Furthermore, because they are Christian proselytizing creation, they are not legitimate outgrowth of Jewish civilization, la Kaplan, and therefore are not given the same leniency as Jewish apostates The Messianic Phenomenon is Entirely Christian and Is Not a Form of Judaism.
If you believe in a tri-omni (all knowing, all powerful, all loving), or even a deistic god, the meaning of life is still completely unknown with regard to the attribute of omnipotence of god
My argument is as follows: P1: god exists with omnipotenc P2: god has no deficiencies, shortcomings or inadequacies, in other words god 'needs' nothin P3: desire ultimately stems from deficiencies, shortcomings or inadequacie P4: the creation of humans cannot fulfil any need or satisfy any desire that god ha C: god created human beings with ultimately no purpos I feel that I must elaborate on the 2nd and 3rd premise as it the most dubious
P2 god has no deficiencies is derived from the fact that an infinite being could theoretically have anything, so a specific desire can't possibly have a purpose
For example, if someone theoretically had an infinite amount of money to spend, they cannot possibly desire more money, fundamentally they could but why? There would ultimately be no purpose of having more money if you already have an infinite amount to spend
P3 just means that the reason for desire is really just from a lack of things
An example of this is, the desire for food
Why would someone want food? Because of their caloric requirements and their deficiency of requiring food for nutrients
This analogy is hard to relate to god, but you get the point I would like to formally thank anyone who read this far, and for taking the time to respond to my arguments
I'll do my best to respond to the counterarguments god cannot be invoked to answer the meaning of life
Assuming that God created  our physical reality, then all of creation is an act of God
If the teachings or scripture of a religion doesn't align with observable facts, then those teachings or scriptures are actually in disagreement with God
One could make the argument that our methods of observing and interacting with reality are subject to limitations and therefore fallible, but we rely on our ability to observe, make judgments, and react to our environment to stay alive everyday
If you are alive to read this, these abilities and skills have been successful so far So unless God is deliberately trying to trick you into disbelief, why not rely on the objective reality that God created to judge the scriptures and teachings that have come from fallible humans The Teachings of Any True Religion Must Align With Objective Facts and Science.
Eternal oblivion seems to be the logical conclusion to physicalist theories of the mind
Dead brain = dead consciousness
You will no longer continue to have experience for as long as time continues to churn
I do feel as though a lot of us non-theists take eternal oblivion for granted, and the most basic assumption for the question what happens after we die, I do believe there are small holes to this theory A lot of this mainly comes from the anecdotes (unfortunately) of hundreds of people who have had near-death experiences
For the sake of the argument, let's ignore cases that could potentially be explained hypoxia DMT. . . etc
Mainly cases that do conveniently seem like hallucinations of otherworldly dimensions, of heaven, of hell. .
etc Instead, veridical near death experiences, in which the experiencer is highly unlikely to have conscious awareness of anything, is able to have awareness of events that can be corroborated
'Peak in Darien' experiences are also interesting as they involve cases in which the experiencer has visions of people that, unbeknownst to them, were dead
Brain activity is thought to cease 10-20 seconds after cardiac arrest
Brain damage from hypoxia/cardiac arrest is thought to ensue in 9-10 minutes
In many of these cases, flat EEGs were observed, and the experience is thought to have occurred during the time frame of minuscule brain activity Under a purely physical conception of the mind (my views still align mainly with physicalism), it seems intuitively impossible for such an experience to occur
Yet, in both NDE types, the experience seems to pick up on information they shouldn't have picked up on The most well-known case seems to be that of Pam Reynolds In 1991, aged 35, Reynolds experienced symptoms of dizziness, loss of speech and difficulty moving her body
A CT scan revealed a giant aneurysm at the base of her brain
The neurologist to whom she was referred predicted little or no chance of survival; because of its size and location, regular neurosurgical techniques to excise it would not work
She was then referred to Dr Robert Spetzler in Phoenix, Arizona, who had pioneered a surgical procedure, hypothermic cardiac arrest, that would make the aneurysm operable
This involved cooling the patient’s body to sixty degrees Fahrenheit, stopping the heartbeat and breathing, and draining all blood from the brain More than twenty doctors, nurses and technicians took part
The operation required Reynolds’s vital signs and body temperature to be very closely monitored by multiple instruments placed in various locations on and within her body
Molded speakers were placed in her ears, producing clicks at regular intervals, so that other instruments could detect her brain’s reactions to them Reynolds was awake when she was brought into the operating room at 7:15 am
She felt a ‘loss of time’ and blanked out as the general anaesthesia took effect
Then she became aware of a musical tone that seemed to pull her out of the top of her head The further out of my body I got, the more clear the tone became
I had the impression it was like a road, a frequency that you go on … I remember seeing several things in the operating room when I was looking down
It was the most aware that I think that I have ever been in my entire life … It was brighter and more focused and clearer than normal vision … There was so much in the operating room that I didn’t recognize, and so many people She recalled being surprised that the team had only partially shaved her head
She also recalled seeing the bone-saw Spetzler used to excise a section of her skull The saw thing … looked like an electric toothbrush and it had a dent in it, a groove at the top where the saw appeared to go into the handle, but it didn’t … And the saw had interchangeable blades, too, but these blades were in what looked like a socket wrench case … I heard the saw crank up She found this sound unpleasant
‘Someone said something about my veins and arteries being very small,’ Reynolds recalled, adding that it was a female voice
At this stage in the operation, a female cardiac surgeon, having determined that the arteries in Reynolds’s right leg were too small to handle the degree of blood flow required by the heart-lung machine, opened the left leg as well Spetzler assessed the aneurysm and ordered hypothermic cardiac arrest to be performed
Commencing at 10:50 am, blood was removed via tubes from the femoral arteries and veins, chilled in reservoir cylinders and returned to her body
As Reynolds’s core temperature fell, her heartbeat changed to fibrillation, then stopped entirely
Her brainwaves flattened, then, as her core temperature reached sixty, the brainstem shut down
By standard definitions she was clinically dead At 11:25 the heart-lung machine was turned off, the operating table was tilted and blood was drained from her body
The sac of the aneurysm, now empty, was easily excised
The heart-lung machine was then reactivated and warmed blood reinfused into Reynolds’s circulatory system
The brainstem slowly began showing activity again, then her higher brain also, as the warming process continued
At noon it became apparent that her heart would not resume beating by warming alone; electrical jolts from a defibrillator were used to shock it into starting
Having been clinically dead for about an hour, Reynolds was returned to the recovery room in a stable condition at 2:10 pm As cited by Sabom, Reynolds’s next recollections fall between the mention of her arteries being too small, and the time Spetzler’s younger assistants were closing her incisions There was a sensation like being pulled, but not against your will
I was going on my own accord because I wanted to go
I have different metaphors to try to explain this
It was like the Wizard of Oz – being taken up in a tornado vortex, only you’re not spinning around like you’ve got vertigo
You’re very focused and you have a place to go
The feeling was like going up in an elevator real fast
And there was a sensation, but it wasn’t a bodily, physical sensation
It was like a tunnel but it wasn’t a tunnel
At some point very early in the tunnel vortex I became aware of my grandmother calling me
But I didn’t hear her call me with my ears … It was a clearer hearing than with my ears
I trust that sense more than I trust my own ears
The feeling was that she wanted me to come to her, so I continued with no fear down the shaft
It’s a dark shaft that I went through, and at the very end there was this very little tiny pinpoint of light that kept getting bigger and bigger and bigger
The light was incredibly bright, like sitting in the middle of a lightbulb
It was so bright that I put my hands in front of my face fully expecting to see them and I could not
But I knew they were there
Not from a sense of touch
Again, it’s terribly hard to explain, but I knew they were there … I noticed that as I began to discern different figures in the light – and they were all covered with light, they were light, and had light permeating all around them – they began to form shapes I could recognize and understand
I could see that one of them was my grandmother
I don’t know if it was reality or projection, but I would know my grandmother, the sound of her, anytime, anywhere
Everyone I saw, looking back on it, fit perfectly into my understanding of what that person looked like at their best during their lives
I recognized a lot of people
My uncle Gene was there
So was my great-great-Aunt Maggie, who was really a cousin
On Papa’s side of the family, my grandfather was there … They were specifically taking care of me, looking after me
They would not permit me to go further … It was communicated to me – that’s the best way I know how to say it, because they didn’t speak like I’m speaking – that if I went all the way into the light something would happen to me physically
They would be unable to put this me back into the body me, like I had gone too far and they couldn’t reconnect
So they wouldn’t let me go anywhere or do anything
Then they were feeding me
They were not doing this through my mouth, like with food, but they were nourishing me with something
The only way I know how to put it is something sparkly
Sparkles is the image that I get
I definitely recall the sensation of being nurtured and being fed and being made strong
I know it sounds funny, because obviously it wasn’t a physical thing, but inside the experience I felt physically strong, ready for whatever
My grandmother didn’t take me back through the tunnel, or even send me back or ask me to go
She just looked up at me
I expected to go with her, but it was communicated to me that she just didn’t think she would do that
My uncle said he would do it
He’s the one who took me back through the end of the tunnel.  Everything was fine
I did want to go
But then I got to the end of it and saw the thing, my body
I didn’t want to get into it … It looked terrible, like a train wreck
It looked like what it was: dead
I believe it was covered
It scared me and I didn’t want to look at it
It was communicated to me that it was like jumping into a swimming pool
No problem, just jump right into the swimming pool
I didn’t want to, but I guess I was late or something because he [the uncle] pushed me
I felt a definite repelling and at the same time a pulling from the body
The body was pulling and the tunnel was pushing … It was like diving into a pool of ice water … It hurt . _1W1pLIfaIb8rYU6YeTdAk6{margin-right:6px}. _1H6Meh6ZAemKxOJDOEasfK{border-radius:50%;box-sizing:border-box;height:20px;margin-left:-8px;width:20px}. _1H6Meh6ZAemKxOJDOEasfK:first-child{margin-left:0}. _30vlMmCcnqKnXP1t-fzm0e{display:inline-block;margin-left:-8px;position:relative}
A common argument against the Christian God runs as follows.  Slavery Argument (SA) P1
Permitting slavery is immoral P2.  God permitted slavery C
Therefore, God is immoral For argument’s sake, let us assume that slavery is where the master owns the slave against their will, not something like indentured servitude, and something that the Christian God allowed in the Old Testament This leaves a logically valid argument, P2 as true, and P1 as the only premise to attack, so let us object to P1 P1 Refutation An action’s moral status depends on the moral agent’s knowledge of the action’s consequences For example, if one goes up to somebody walking on the train tracks and pushes them down for no reason, then they have obviously acted immorally
The person pushed risks getting hurt for no reason However, if the pusher has knowledge of an oncoming train and knows the consequences of pushing the person will save their life, then they have acted morally So, it seems clear that an action’s morality is at least somewhat determined by their knowledge of consequences This serves as a dual objection to SA since it has implications for 1) the person making the argument and 2) if God can morally allow seemingly immoral actions First, just like our friends knowledge of the oncoming train justified them pushing the person off the tracks, God’s foreknowledge could justify Him in allowing slavery (or you can swap out any seemingly immoral deed)
You’ll notice in the OT passages God never comes out and says Hey, it’s a great idea to allow slavery; the concept of one of you owning the other and treating them badly is a great thing for everyone, etc
It’s more like He tolerates and sets rules around it given the situations Second, even if God did act immorally by allowing slavery, the one making the argument SA is in no position to know this
God could have a good reason for allowing it, like our friend had a good reason to push someone off the tracks
So even if the argument is sound, the one making it is just guessing and got lucky
They didn’t actually make a good argument (ie, one based on knowledge) In sum, SA’s proponent should reflect that if P1 is true, it is either necessarily true or possibly true
If SA’s proponent wants to say that P1 is necessarily true, then they need to show that God cannot have a justification for allowing it (an impossible task)
If SA’s proponent wants to say that P1 is only possibly true, then the argument falls apart: the conclusion is then, weakly, that God is only possibly immoral (just like I possibly don’t exist) SA’s proponent should also realize that my refutation’s form extends to any case where the arguer simply lacks the knowledge required to make the argument: hell is immoral, etc Lastly, we should recognize that my refutation is not simply restating that God works in mysterious ways, we don’t know why He allowed slavery
The refutation’s form completely neutralizes SA: at best, SA shows that God was possibly immoral (so what when possibilities come cheap?) At worst, SA does nothing (if SA’s proponent wants to take the road of saying that God couldn’t possibly have good reason, which would require knowledge of the relevant consequences, which SA’s proponent can never have) The Slavery Problem: an Epistemic Solution
What if God has a bet with angels or some other being that he could convince humans to worship him but the bet has some conditions
He can't make it too easy for the humans to believe in him
He cannot do a miracle or directly intervene or reveal something in his book that only a god would know
That's the the reason can think of now for being vague, and not intervening or doing any miracles and only asking us to believe in him or he will punish uIs it possible that God has a bet that he could make us believe in him without miracles
Sure, I get that Jesus and the early Christians saw themselves as a world religion, but certainly, a lot of Jews would think that Christianity was appropriating their cultural heritage
And Constantine was fully aware of his act of spreading the culture of an oppressed minority without giving much in return to them
Now, I'm not promoting the cultish abuses of Scientology, but could we at least encourage the somewhat independent and culturally regional development of a religious movement? I say this, considering that aliens and UFOs are a staple of American culture, even if British culture and others influenced early science fiction Naturally, I'm aware that my arguments fail if one considers the theological claims of Christianity to be true
Of course, a Christian would consider the spreading of Christianity as the higher good
But could we leave that aside for second and say something substantial about the cultural factors surrounding the development of religions, so that we can encourage new beliefs to be only theologically wrong instead of being both theologically an culturally wrong Christianity did cultural appropriation
We should promote Scientology because at least UFO's are an American cultural heritage.
I see amongst this subreddit and just in general, a lack of basic understanding of the major religions and more specifically Islam
So to educate this subreddit I'll just make a few points on the differences that make Islam unique
Islam does not claim to be a 'new' religion
It's a continuation of previous messengers of Allah that all carried the same message; 'There is One God, He is Unique, He is Uncreated, We are his Creation and we must worship him alone, and no other deity or creation
' Messengers have appeared from the inception of humankind, Adam being the first and Mohammed being the last
In between, there have been over 100,000 messengers sent to mankind to each specific nation according to Islam Islam is the only one to claim it's the last message of Allah and it's sent for all of Mankind and Mohammed (peace be upon him) is the last messenger The Quran is the only text that can be verified and traced back to the time of its inception (When it was revealed to Mohammed)
This point is extremely important, as to base your worldview upon something, you must be sure it's the true authentic message and not corrupted The Quran is free from Contradiction and there are claims inside the Quran to prove its validity
The main ones are, 'The promise of Allah to preserve the message until the end of time', 'To not contain any contradictions' (as this would negate it being from an all Knowledgable creator), 'A challenge to create a verse like it'
If any of these are broken, the validity of the Quran will be false There are others, but I feel like these are important to point out as generally, people talk of Islam while making basic errors
If there are any misconceptions anyone has, I'd be happy to clear them up
All ask is that you present it in respectful way and be sincere in your discourse and conduct Why Islam is unique amongst all other major religions
18 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth
1 For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them
2 For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, ] in the things that have been made
So they are without excuse - Romans 1:18-2 The heart is deceitful above all things and desperately sick who can understand it - Jeremiah 17: The Bible Claims that men are corrupt beings
Their very minds are deceitful
Their ways and thoughts are different to God, and unless illuminated by the Spirit they cannot discern spiritual things Yet Paul claims men have no excuse for not believing in God - specifically, the God of Israel - because he claims our intuition naturally points to God So which is it - do we trust our intuition or not? Do our hearts naturally perceive reality or don't they? Are our minds instinctively oriented to truth or deception It seems that when it comes to human instincts, the Bible wants to have its cake and eat it too
when our instincts point toward concepts that support the Bible, we can trust them
When they don't, we can't
That's a terrible argument that can be used to support anything You know UFOs are real because you instinctively fee there must be intelligent life out there / you know UFOs are false because you instinctively fee humans can trick themselves into seeing things in the sky that aren't real
Because the Bible makes it clear the human heart is naturally deceitful, Paul's Romans 1 argument that men inherently perceive God's existence holds no weight
You can't choose what you believe, God would know this, and would also know what evidence he would need to convince them
Yet he chooses not to give them that evidence
Therefore, it is impossible for certain atheists to believe in God, yet they are sentenced to eternal suffering anyway
Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him
John 3:36 I'm still looking for an exact source on whether or not Non-muslims go to hell
If you have one, please can you leave it in the comments If God exists then he doesn't want athiests to believe in him

You might think this is going to be some long winded thing about god not having any right to dictate our lives but no
The simple fact is this: god has no right to judge any of us as he isn't fit to
A judge has no right to judge if they won't even follow their own rules and laws
God says not to murder (And he is right with this one.  Murder is entirely immoral
Self defense is one thing but murder is not right) but then turns around and kills numerous people
One can argue the instances of him ordering followers to kill others as self-defense (Though that is wrong because they murdered babies and children in cold blood NOT self-defense) but when god directly kills or causes deaths? He sins
As nothing poses a threat to him so it cannot be self-defense thus it is cold blooded  murder no matter how you try to justify it Then there is god's love which again is a lie
god has no love and thus is nothin What does the Bible itself say 1 Corinthians 13: 1-1 If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing If I give all I possess to the poor and surrender my body to the flames, but have not love, I gain nothing Love is patient, love is kind
It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres Love never fails
But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away For we know in part and we prophesy in part, but when perfection comes, the imperfect disappears When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child
When I became a man, I put childish ways behind me Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face
Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known And now these three remain: faith, hope and love
But the greatest of these is love god however is jealous.  god gets angered easily
god does keep track of your wrong doings and only forgets them with conditions you must meet In all honesty god being afraid of us makes what Jesus said make more sense
Jesus came to divide us
To set us upon one another
Father against son, mother against daughter And really that is all that needs to be said
Just this things bars him from having any right to judge us
And proves that the god of the christian bible is either nothing, the Bible is entirely wrong, or that the bible is made up
And writing this I had an epiphany: What if that is the point of the Bible? To show that absolutely no one has the right to judge someone else not even god? And let me guess. .
if god is scared of us then he has the right to kill us in self-defense.  No
Killing to stay in power is also sinful and wrong
These things are in the Bible itself so you as christians CANNOT deny them
That would mean you are denying your bibles
Or perhaps the Gnostic faith is right and Jesus was a double agent chosen by the real God to give us the answer on how to deal with the fake god EDIT: What if. .
what if the Bible is mirror? What you see and are angered by is reflection of the self? And the message is God will not judge you ever because he is said to be love thus if God won't judge you becuse he is love what right do you have to judge others? What right do you have to not love others The Christian God is not fit to judge anyone and is scared of us because he is nothing.
I’ve see a lot of discussion lately regarding infinite regress or the impossibility thereof
From what I’ve seen, it’s simply asserted, that EVERY eternal model of the universe would somehow always end in impossible infinite regress
Even it’s most prominent supporter, WLC, states he believes an infinite regress to be a metaphysical possibility, which is certainly up for debate and not something regarded as certain at all However, there’s plenty of mathematically consistent and empirically adequate eternal cosmological models
And there doesn’t seem to be an inherent or logical contradictions with actual infinites in math or physics Here’s two great videos on the kalam which spend a good amount of time on infinites (the first especially so Leading mathematicians, physicists, and philosophers discuss the kalam https://youtu. be/pGKe6YzHiM https://youtu
be/femxJFszbo Problems with infinite regress
All the religions seem to be extremely earth based, which is strange considering the mind boggling size of space ie the univers
A sand grain size piece of universe , holds thousands of Galaxies, containing thousands of planets Unless we believe the scriptures to be not complete or your God of choice deliberately withholding information from mankind, it makes zero sense why God doesn't talk about alien life (did the Zorgons get a visit by Jesus?) on other places than earth or potential for life expanding beyond earth The most logical conclusion would God doesn't know about it ie  the prophet was a regular human being who wrote the book and was limited by the knowledge of the times Let's assume that all the space IS empty
There's only human beings out in the infinite void on a small dust ball
Still, you'd think God would talk about something as monumental as humans moving out of their original home of Earth (even the moon landing!) and settling in the stars but nope, he drops no wisdom on it
The maximum distance he talks about getting stuff done in by mankind is the four corners of the earth So here is my point, God in religion is man made because God it creates is limited by the knowledge of men than
What are your views on this Personally, why does no religion's God talk about alien life or human life becoming multiplanetary seems to be because he is human construct The lack of God talking about life on other planets or humans colonising space seems like a case for him being a human construct
One of, if not the most common argument I hear from theists is the issue of something coming from nothing, but this argument is completely incoherent
As I see it, there are a few possibilities Things that exist can simply be eternal, which would mean that the universe or some fundamental part of it could be eternal
This possibility allows the universe to exist without a god Things that exist cannot be eternal, but do need a cause to begin existing
If this is true, there is no evidence to suggest that this cause would have to be a god, but even if it did, it also means that something else had to cause god to exist, and something had to cause that to exist which obviously leads to an infinite regression
So for the theist, either, infinite regression is a problem and god suffers from it just as much as anything else, or infinite regression is not a problem and god doesnt have to exist anywhere in the chain
It simply cannot be had both ways Things can simply begin to exist without cause, this eliminates the problem of infinite regression, but also pretty obviously allows the universe to exist without god would also posit that any possible objection in favor of god necessarily relies on special pleading fallacy, and can be rejected The Problem of Something Coming From Nothing is a Terrible Argument for God
The Bible contains many stories which are, from a historical standpoint, completely baseless
For example, (and this will be my prime example) the story of the Exodus is completely without foundation
No authentic record of Egyptian antiquity ever records anything like the Exodus, and the Egyptian records that Christians point to as support of the Exodus either blatantly contradict the Bible, or they refer to something else that should be viewed in its own context
The point is,the Bible claims that extremely extravagant events happened in history, despite the fact that there is no evidence to support such an assertion
How can one believe that the Bible is god inspired, when it contains such blatant myths? The Bible is historically inaccurate and therefore not the word of God.
I want to start with an important point: I am sure theists or non-theist alike can agree that humans are fully capable or fabricating systems of belief that are simply that, purely fabrication
With that consideration in mind that throughout time there have been systems of belief created that were deemed religions at some point or another There reason I wish to start with this point is that I want to introduce the notion that it is possible for humans to fabricate systems of belief, more specifically religions Throughout the history of religion, a point that was always problematic to me, was that many of them seemed to heavily rely on humans to relay the central truth of that given religion
Usually this is through prophets or similar in the whole person in authority who communes with God to then relay given messages on etc
Many of the God(s) of the worlds religions seemingly favor this approach; Judaism, the Baháʼí Religion, Islam, Native American Indian religions, Hinduism and Christianity, as a few examples However, the reason this is problematic should be obvious
It is also the exact same way that any given charlatan or fraud would set about fabricating their own system of belief for others to follow, for nefarious reasons
If you had a mechanism to help you reliably, accurately and consistently discern, or test, whether a given person genuinely liaised with God, then this might aleviate some of the issues associated with that
Another issue is whether the human that God chose to impart a message to, heard it correctly or not, they are fallible humans, they could have misinterpreted the message However, it seems quite clear that there is no mechanism that can reliably, accurately and consistently figure out whether a given person genuinely received instruction from God, nor whether the message they received, as a fallible humanbeing, was received correctly The following observations/comments that I feel are very reasonable, can be made One
If man is simply fabricating systems of belief, based on idealistic fantasy, then it makes complete sense that the only mechanism for that message of truth to be circulated around, especially pre modern technology, was by oral tradition and/or writing it down Two
Despite the general favoritism by many religions to use the above mentioned method, we have yet to have any God(s) associated with them to unmistakably clear up the confusion, misinterpretation and outright flaws in many of the messages passed on in that manner Three
If there is no mechanism to reliably discern the validty of a prophetic claim or the claim of any given person to have spoken with God, then it makes any given set of beliefs that spawn out of that no more credible than any other
In fact, we have plenty of examples of clearly madeup/fabricated religious systems of belief which convinced many people to follow and some of those having resulted in atrocities (the Jonestown massacre an infamous example)
You could quite credibly argue that we have contemporary examples in things like Mormonism as made up Three A
Another hallmark of there being no mechanism to fact or error check those claims, is that they will result in disagreements on those beliefs over time, resulting in people splitting off of a once central system of beliefs
As people disagree and with no way to reliably, accurately and consistently method confirm the truth of God communication, people can just make their own version of what they think is true and have the freedom to follow that and convince others it is true too To conclude: We know people make systems of beliefs up, that those systems can eventually make their way to be a religious belief is also entirely possible and a reasonable assumption
It is too much a conicidence that so many religions (particularly the major ones) rely on humans to spread their messages of truth, in place of some clearly/undeniable message which would be totally within the power of God(s) of those religions to impart on us (if they do actually exist)
Considering the clear problems with the error-prone/fallible nature of humans, it makes no sense for any God(s) of different religions to constantly rely on them to impart the all-important truth
Furthermore, considering the amount of hatred, intolerence and bloodshed that has occurred as a result of specifically religious disagreements, it highlights how imperitive it is for the God(s) of those religions to clear the confusion up and/or use a more reliable system for their message Overall, almost everything you would expect from humans making up religious systems of belief, is almost exactly what we see of them, with plenty of undeniable examples
We don't see anything undeniably of God(s/ly) origin in the persistence of religious systems of belief, just slight variations of the same oral and/or written tradition
We see the same issues between religions (ie denominations and shisms) and almost none of them presenting any reliable, accurate and consistent method to do away with wrong denominations/shisms and bring it back to the central truth Now of course this does not demonstrate with any direct conclusivity that all religions are simply man-made systems of belief
But it does provide several lines of evidence and good reasons to be incredibly suspect of all religions
That we should be expecting a high threshold of evidence and thorough demonstrations that address the issues above
If were to focus on specific issue it is that we have no way to tell the difference between someone who is insane, or intentially making things up when compared to someone who is prophet or genuinely receiving instruction from God The fact that the world's religions (specifically the major ones) all seemingly rely on human methods to relay the truth of their central claims is more indicative of them being purely a result of human fabrication rather than from actual God(s).
For example why is there no documented miracles that couldn't have happened either naturally or through medical treatments.   Example Amputees
Does God still do miracle healings..
So I think we can all agree that there are some really bad arguments in favor of Christianity
There are some arguments we probably can't agree on, like the moral argument or the cosmological argument
Let's not talk about those (I'm not talking about those) someon i goin t respon jus t thi firs sentenc an wan t tal abou thos promise an it' gonn b hilarious Let's focus just on the arguments that everyone who is even vaguely reasonable, pretty much knows are bad If you just reject those arguments (certain terms and conditions apply, I explain more below).  You end up rejecting. . .  kinda everything
Like, the sheer number of dumb christian arguments, created a wall of skepticism that is too high for almost any other belief to climb over
Nothing else (or almost nothing else) meets the standard of simply doing better than these bad arguments in favor of Christianity
Mostly because we just don't spend a lot of time justifying and rationalizing the majority of the things we believe on a day to day basis) Here are some of the arguments I can think of Argument from (biased) Authority My parents, or my pastor, or someone I trust told me to be a Christian, and I did, and I liked it so I never went back
Also the experts they turned me on to said they were right Argument from Subjective Experience When I sing worship songs, I feel tingly all over and I just know the Holy Spirit is with me, and you could feel it too and then you would know Argument from Anecdote My cousin's brother's boyfriend's grandpa totally had cancer back in the 40s and the doctors said he had 24 hours to live and then Billy Graham dropped a piece of chalk and he was totally healed Argument from Hypothetical Threat of Violence You better believe, because if you don't you will go to hell and they don't have AC there in the summertim Argument from Wanting to Believe it I would be miserable if I was a doubter like you
I want to know that I am loved and I am going to heaven
It gives me peace Argument from Personal Horribleness If I were not a Christian, I would rape and murder people left and righ Circular Argument It says so right here, in the Bibl The Argument That Got Away There was a scientist, and he came to my school, and he showed us all right then and there why evolution is impossible
I can't remember or replicate it all because I am not a scientist and I don't remember his name, but it's true I swear Argument from Upbringing I've been a Christian as long as I can remember.
Argument from Bad Alternatives At least I'm not an atheist like you, you atheists probably lick streetlamps and sleep with your shoes off Argument from Just have faith I never really thought about it
Just believe There are probably others, but I feel like these lay a solid groundwork off the top of my head
I think we can all agree that these are bad arguments
I have phrased them humorously for the sake of readability, but I don't think it's a strawman because even more seriously worded variants just don't work
You shouldn't believe things just because someone told you, or because it makes you happy, or because you read it in a book that the idea literally comes from
Right? Right I WANT to reject all of these reasons
I WANT these to be bad arguments
But what happens to my thought life if I reject every idea that is supported by one or more of these bad arguments? What do I have left that i can think is good, or commit to, or believe in, if I reject Anything that I believe or do only because someone I trusted said so (and I haven't gone and checked it out extensively in an objective and impartial way Anything that I believe or do just because I tried it and liked i Anything I believe or do because I heard good thing Anything I believe or do just in case something terrible (but improbable) happens, to cover my but Anything I believe or do just because I want t Anything I believe or do because I worry I would indulge bad habits otherwis Anything I believe or do because a book about believing or doing it endorses believing or doing i Anything I can't remember why I believe or do, but I was sure at the tim Anything I believe or do just because I always hav Anything I believe or do because I prefer it to the alternatives I know abou Anything I believe or do just cu Like. . .
those arguments were so puny and insignificant a minute ago
But now what can I justify Consider a statement like Exercise is good for you How would I go about defending that? Well, doctors and personal trainers and gym teachers all agree. .
but they are all obviously biased in favor of exercise
I can try it and feel myself getting healthier, but that's subjective
I have lots of anecdotes. .
But if you ask me to prove it. .
I can't I think a choice of religion is a big choice that affects a lot of life socially and otherwise, so it's a lot like nationality
How would I defend a statement like I (should continue to) live in the USA Well, my friends and family are here, I've just sorta always lived here.  I was born here
If I left I don't know where I would go. .
I don't have a good answer Why do I think Android is better than iPhone, or that the Longhorns are better than the Aggies.  I dunno
I just sorta DO I suspect a lot of you will spout off about Extraordinary claims and I hear you
But it seems to me that these arguments aren't just insufficient for extraordinary claims, they are actually dumb for any claim
Even so, what would be an extraordinary claim that I have accepted on the basis of extraordinary evidence? How about There used to be a race of giant lizards that roamed the planet called Dinosaurs Okay
Where? I've never seen one
Even the bones I saw at the museum were literally fake
They told me at the museum they had fake bones on display and the real bones were hidden somewhere Even concepts like I Exist are really really really hard to justify
Like, I've read Descartes, I think therefore I am but that's literally the John 3:16 of the book on justifying I exist
How many books have I read on the possibility that I might not exist? And maybe I exist in some form, but is the person I call me actually accurate? Am I the same person I remember being as a child? Is the image I have in my head of myself the same person who actually IS? How the hell would I know Is there ANYTHING that anyone here can actualy justify without appealing to one or more of these dumb reasons? I leave open the possibility that there may be one or two things, but I can't think of them
And there certainly aren't enough to live a functional life We've gotten so good at debunking, we seem to have entirely lost track of how to bunk Terms and Conditions: *Whe sa rejec thes arguments ' mea t impl tha yo rejec the all An yo rejec the unilaterally tha is yo rejec the o th basi tha the ar jus stupi an ba an no goo wa t determin wha t believ in instea o rejectin the i som specifi contextua wa fo wh tha specifi argumen doe no appl t tha specific
CONCLUSION: I dunno nothing really
I just think it's interesting
I believe a lot of us on these forums think of ourselves as hardened skeptics, even the Christians, who don't abide bad arguments
But we totally do in most areas of our lives
It doesn't mean Christianity is true or false or atheism is true or false
just thought it was interesting Rejecting the worst arguments for Christianity on the basis of Skepticism presents enormous problems everywhere else

The Waukesha Parade attacker, Darrell Brooks, blamed the Christian God for his actions on November 21st, 2021, when he murdered 6 people and injured over 60 others
During his closing arguments, Brook's blamed God's will for his own actions
Many took offense to this, but if you believe in an omni-God, is he wrong? This is ultimately the problem of evil in philosophy of religion
Why would a deity which is both omnipotent &amp; omniscient allow for evil to exist? As Epicurus famously said, Is God willing to prevent evil, but unable? Then He is impotent
Is he able, but not willing? Then He is malevolent
Is he both able &amp; willing? Whence then is evil? https://youtu

Leviticus 20:13 describes two men having sex with each other as an abomination and sentences the participants to death
Meanwhile, Leviticus 25:44-46 allows for enslaving someone for life (so long as that someone isn't an Israelite), and Exodus 21:20-21 allows for beating owned slaves, so long as they don't die from it
There is an unspecified punishment for beating slave to death, but said punishment likely isn't death, given how the Bible is hardly shy about explicitly naming death as the penalty for wide variety of other actions Given that gay sex would result in the participants being executed, whereas slaveowner buying someone and abusing them into submission would result in no punishment whatsoever so long as the slave doesn't die, it seems abundantly clear that the Bible paints gay sex as being worse than enslaving human beings Now, what's more likely The universe was created by homophobic slaver god who passed these edicts down to us from on hig The god of the Bible was created by homophobic slaver humans in their own image, just as humans have created thousands of other gods in their own image consider option far, far more likely to be true The Bible treats homosexuality worse than slavery.
I was born and raised a Baptist in the Bible Belt but have become an atheist within the last few years
One thing that has always struck me as odd is hearing the inerrancy of God's word preached but the apparent contradictions to this
One of the most prevalent issues with this is the fact that God said that he would both preserve his word as well as guide anyone who seeks him
People born and raised into opposing sects of Christianity and are very likely to never leave that particular sect
The differences between the denominations are often pretty trivial but sometimes they are matters of salvation and ideas intrinsic to Christianity itself If God isn't concerned enough to correct those issues that could potentially send an individual to Hell, that would seem to be a direct contradiction to his word I had asked some pastor friends of mine this question and their responses were generally something to the tune of leaning upon your own understanding of the bible often leads people to be misled or even Satan can use the scriptures themselves to lead people astray while they feel they are pursuing righteousness This line of thinking is even more problematic because it  proves that either God is incapable of correcting his followers or he simply doesn't care to do so
Two people earnestly seeking God's guidance should not be able to get different answers to their questions and yet this happens all the time At the very least this proves that versions of the Bible that claim God will guide those who seek him are not correct
Ultimately you cannot know for fact that you yourself are doing God's will or being misled by something that feels exactly like God's guidance but is in fact case of holy identity theft Different sects of Christianity disprove Christianity
I know that there are many sins in the Bible, and most of them are understandable, and even helpful such as you can’t murder people or steal stuff but out of all the sins, not believing in god is the stupidest of them all
I though god was selfless and wanted to help us
Also if god is so good and real than people should have no doubts about his existence but they do
If you don’t believe in god than every good thing, every person you’ve ever helped, every person who’s day was made thanks to your good actions do not matter if you don’t believe in god
God should care about us being good people, not believing in him
He should be happy to show people the way but instead he leaves it up to you Last thing, isn’t the reason god tried flooding earth was cause we were bad? Just cause you believe in god doesn’t make you a good person, there are some awful Christians
Also not all athiest are bad people and sometimes do better than Christian’s whitch is kinda contradictory of the point of believing God cares more about you believing in him then actually being a good person
When asked why there must be an objective morality created by god, Christians often reply well because if there weren't, how could we know what was good and what was bad? But this isn't an appeal to any sort of evidence, it is an appeal to one's desires to be comfortable and to make sense of the world
While it might feel good to believe that there is some underlying rule of the universe that delineates what is right and what is wrong, and it might be easier to believe this, that does not mean that any such rule exists
If objective morality did not exist we would not be able to state exactly what is good and what is bad with 100% certainty
Good and evil would ultimately be based on opinion
So what? Neither of those statements prove anything
They prove that for some people it may be more comfortable to believe in objective morality, but neither statement proves that there must be an objective morality
It might be scarier to live in a world where morality is based on opinion and no moral prescription is set in stone, but tough luck, that's the world we live in
Just because something is scary doesn't mean it isn't also a fact of life It might be more comfortable to believe that smoking cigarettes does not cause cancer
It might be more comfortable to believe that we never have to go to the dentist
It might be rather intuitive to believe we never have to go to the dentist
After all, we brush our teeth right? Therefore it makes sense that we shouldn't get cavities
However, defaulting to the most simple or most comfortable mode of thinking may cause us to miss important details and come to the wrong conclusion
It may be more comfortable and intuitive to believe the world is flat
However, the fact that it is comfortable and intuitive does not prove that it is the case Even if objective morality is comforting to believe in and feels intuitive, neither or those things make it any more likely to exist than subjective morality.

There is no such thing as a supernatural claim and nothing outside naturalism.  First a little background
The only thing outside the realm of science is that which is subjective
So fair play: the subjective might be outside naturalism
Science cannot tell us if we watched a good game
You and I may watch the same game and decide it was good or bad and we can both be right even if we have opposing opinions
Science is of no use here Second, for anything objectively true. .
anything that is true for everyone everywhere at the same time. .
that is within the realm of science, reason, and naturalism
For example, if we wanted to ask Did a game take place? We could use science, reason, and naturalism to find an answer Third, a limitation of technology does not put an objective thing outside the realm of science
For example, we can all agree that we can use science to know where the moon will be at any given date
We can use telescopes, mathematics, and other techniques to know this
If we ask, Where will the moon be in 100 years from this moment it's a matter of science
If we had never invented telescopes it would still be a matter of science
Because it's an objective phenomenon Fourth, any truth claim about reality that's objective falls under the realm of science.  This includes religious miracles
They either happened or they didn't
It's a fact or a falsehood
Jesus either walked on water or he didn't
It's impossible for him to have walked on water for me AND to have (somehow) not walked on water for you
If there were any science that supported it, you can bet that Christians would absolutely be screaming their heads off about it to anyone who would listen The conclusion we come to is to see so-called supernatural claims for what they are: failed scientific hypotheses that are so resoundingly nonsensical that their chance of being true is best described as so low to be as good as false
Most theists have been taught (often from the time they can speak) that claims about their own religion either don't require evidence (Faith!) or operate under a different set of bad logical rules (Because GOD that's why)
When disarmed of this illogic and forced to use the same consistent logic everyone else uses (And the same logic theists themselves use for phenomenon outside their religion) the truth becomes clear Jesus walked on water is a scientific claim and it's one we have no reason to believe
We know water can't be walked upon and the only so-called evidence theists have is to just heap on more and more unsupported claims and special pleadings
It's like this for every miracle/supernatural claim EDIT So I've made similar arguments before and something that always pops up is could there be evidence for [miraculous thing]? It's possible! And We can take ANY unlikely, false, or impossible claim and falsely make it sound more plausible by insisting that some unknown bit of evidence COULD be out there
This sentence has no letters in it
Does it become any more reasonable if we say well there COULD be evidence there's no letters in the previous sentence! We haven't gotten any closer to proving the claim
No evidence has been provided
There's still a ton of letters in the sentence
Actual evidence and the possibility of evidence are not interchangeable Theists will invoke this to try to lend credibility to unsupported nonsense claims
As though this little smoke and mirrors can (somehow) stand in for evidence.  It can't.  It's disingenuous
Just an attempt to move the goal posts There is no such thing as a supernatural claim and nothing outside naturalism.
If Universalism is true, then I'm going to heaven anyway
If purgatorial universalism is true, I may have to go to hell for a bit or wait in purgatory for a bit then I'll go to heaven anyway
If annihilationism is true I will maybe suffer for a bit but eventually, be eternally destroyed and cease to exist
All these viewpoints of Hell pale in comparison to eternal conscious torment
ECT means that I would be suffering in a lake of fire under maximum physical and mental agony forever and ever without end due to coming to the incorrect conclusion on the gospel
ECT makes accepting the gospel the most significant act a human being can do without any possible terms of comparison due to the consequences of not doing so
Most importantly if ECT is true every Christian that says ECT is not true will be doing unbelievers a disservice and may be liable to God for not adequately warning us of the severity of the consequences of rejecting Jesus
Assumption-Hell exists, and it is eternal conscious tormen If that assumption is correct, it's good to be saved and to be sure of your salvation
How can Christians be sure of their salvation due to contradictory assertions on salvation? Some say you have to speak in tongues, or you will burn in hell, some say you must live a life of holiness and repentance, and any declaration of faith in Christ, or the gospel is meaningless unless backed up by a holy lifestyle, many say lifestyle doesn't matter all you have to do is accept Jesus Someone who is convinced that Jesus is their Lord and Saviour, and the gospel is true and fails to live a holy lifestyle could face ECT for being lukewarm and failing to TRULY accept the gospel through their lifestyle
This shows that incorrect theology even amongst Christians can be the difference between ECT and eternal life That's why think it's unreasonable to claim that theological differences between hell and salvation are trivial when they could be the difference between ECT and eternal life Christian theological differences on hell and salvation are NOT trivial
The Bible is not the word of God It is impossible for the modern Bible to be the inerrant word of God as there are too many errors, inconsistencies, and a lack of preservation of the original revealed message The modern Bible is a report of people, not the word of God and can not be considered divine revelation or a guide for humanity The most prominent writer of the new testament, Paul, never met Jesus
He actually persecuted the followers of Jesus early on in his life The fact that the writers of the New Testament came decades and even centuries after Jesus shows that there is no way Jesus’s message was accurately preserved
Also many of the writers of the New Testament are unknown, how is that credible? How can an individual accept revelation from an unknown source This is why there are so many errors and contradictions in the bible Here are some selected clear contradictions in he bible Did Michal have children or not? 2 Samuel 6:23: So Michal, the daughter of Saul, remained childless throughout her entire life
2 Samuel 21:8: But he gave them Saul’s two sons Armoni and Mephibosheth, whose mother was Rizpah daughter of Aiah
He also gave them the five sons of Saul’s daughter Merab, the wife of Adriel son of Barzillai from Meholah How many were in the army of Israel? 1
1 million or 800,000? 1 Chronicle's 21:5: Joab reported the number of the fighting men to David: In all Israel there were one million one hundred thousand men who could handle a sword, including four hundred and seventy thousand in Judah
2 Samuel  24:9: Joab reported the number of the fighting men to the king: In Israel there were eight hundred thousand able-bodied men who could handle a sword, and in Judah five hundred thousand Who was Joseph's father? Heli or Jacob? Luke 3:23: Jesus was about thirty years old when he began his public ministry
Jesus was known as the son of Joseph
Joseph was the son of Heli
Matthew 1:16: Jacob was the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary
Mary gave birth to Jesus, who is called the Messia How did Judas die? Did he hang or fall headfirst? Matthew 27: 5 Then Judas threw the silver coins down in the Temple and went out and hanged himself
Acts 1:18 With the payment he received for his wickedness, Judas bought a field; there he fell headlong, his body burst open and all his intestines spilled out How many stalls did Solomon have? 4,000 or 40,000? 2 Chronicles 9:25Solomon had 4,000 stalls for his horses and chariots, and he had 12,000 horses
He stationed some of them in the chariot cities, and some near him in Jerusalem
1 Kings 4:26 Solomon had 40,000 stalls for his chariot horses, and he had 12,000 horses How old was Ahaziah when he became king ? 22 or 42 years old? 2 Kings 8:26  Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem one year
His mother was Athaliah, a granddaughter of King Omri of Israel 2 Chronicles 22:2 KJV  Ahaziah was forty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem
His mother’s name was Athaliah the granddaughter of Omri How old was Jehoichin when he became king? 8 or 18 years old? 2 Kings 24:8 Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months
His mother was Nehushta, the daughter of Elnathan from Jerusalem
2 Chronicles 36:9 Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months and ten days
Jehoiachin did what was evil in the LORD’s sight How can the Bible be relied upon by billions of individuals when it is filled with so many errors, inconsistencies, and contradictions When the bible has such clear contradictions, we can not make it criteria of what is true and untrue, what is wrong and not wrong, what is moral and amoral, and we definitely can not consider it the inerrant word of God The Bible is not the inerrant word of God.
I remember the moments surrounding my conversion to Theism (Christianity)
Although I grew up in a household that was aware and accepted that God existed, when I became a teenager I felt ‘empty’
I felt like I needed a purpose in life
I’d go to youth group and the message of ‘God loves you and God has a purpose for you’, in addition to the music and group think.
really resonated with me to the point where I decided to beieve in Jesus/God
At this time in my life I didn’t know any ‘apologetical’ arguments for God’s existence besides stuff my youth pastor would say, such as: how do you get something from nothing, how do you get order from chaos’
I believed in Adam and Eve, a young earth, a young human species. . ect
I have a speech impediment
I was aware that If you asked God to heal you, and if you earnestly asked it, he would
I asked him to heal it and he didn’t
I rationalized it with: maybe God wants to use what I have for his benefit, or maybe God has a better plan for me
My belief in God was based on a more psychological grounding involving being,  purpose, and rationalizations rather than evidence/reasoning, logic It wasn’t until I went to college and learned about anthropology/human evolution where my beliefs about God became challeneged
An example was: if The earth is billions of years old, and human are hundred thousands of years old, why does the timeline really only go back 6-10k years? The order of creation isn’t even scentifically correct
If we evolved, then we weren’t made from dust/clay. .
and there really wasn’t an Adam and Eve, and the house of cards began to fall The reason I bring this up is.
I feel when having ‘debates’ regarding which religion is true.
which religion has the best proofs. .  the best evidence. .  ect.
I feel the relgious side isn’’t being completely honest insofar as WHY they believe in God in the first place It’s been my understanding, now as an Atheist, that ‘evidence/reason/logic’, whatever term you want to use, is only supplemented into the belief structure to support a belief that is based in emotion and psychological grounding
That’s why I’ve found it so difficult to debate Theists
If reason/evidence/logic is why you believe God exists, then showing you why your reason/logic/evidence is bad SHOULD convince you that you don’t have a good reason to believe in God
Instead, it doesn’t; the belief persists So I ask, what is your fundamental reason for holding a belief in whatever religion you subscribe to? Is it truly based in evidence/reason/logic.
or are you comfortable with saying your religion may not be true, but believing it makes you feel good by filling an existential void in your life Fundamental Reason for your Reliigous Belief
I mean, from the latest physics research it is clearly implied that reality is broken and nobody even knows what the basic components of reality are
But most likely space and time don't figure at a fundamental level
Yet, for some reason, the magnitude and the expansive nature of these frameworks are brought into play to say how insignificant we are to the universe in the bigger scheme of things or derive philosophical conclusions based on an onthology that is misleadin In fact, i would argue that the fine tuning of the universe and the fact that we can understand it means that life could play a bigger role than we imagine
And this doesn't come from a religious perspective
There are very strong philosophical and scientific indications that an universe witouth someone to perceive it would  look very different or not exist altogether, as many modern physicists would claim
There sre not cranks or new age hippies we are talking about The problem is these ideas have not reached yet the public consciousness in a big way
Most people still conceptualize the universe as a very big place where we just apoeared randomly on some corner
However, there might be more interdependence than we think between us and 'what is out there' so it is very premature and naive to draw philosophical conclusions based on current undetstanding I guess the bigger picture i'm trying to get across is that science is not a good guide for telling truths about what ultimate reality might be and the role we play in the universe
So many people nowdays think science is or will be able to provide answers to foundational questions humans have been asking since the beginning, thus falling into scientism
But, at the end of the day, we are still stuck with philosophy and religion, all coming down to jump of faith Science can't even tell what space nor time are and yet these notions are brought to claim how insignificant humans are
