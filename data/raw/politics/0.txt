<p class="">A top GOP official in Wisconsin who said former President Donald Trump called to urge him to overturn the state’s 2020 election results is scheduled to sit for a deposition Wednesday with the House panel investigating the Jan. 6 riot, two people familiar with the matter said.</p> <p class=""><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/wisconsin-house-speaker-says-trump-called-overturn-2020-results-20-mon-rcna39137" target="_blank">Robin Vos</a>, the speaker of Wisconsin’s state Assembly, was <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/jan-6-committee-subpoenas-wisconsin-gop-leader-targeted-trump-rcna49409" target="_blank">subpoenaed</a> by the committee this year after he publicly revealed that Trump called him 20 months after the election to demand that he dismiss the results. President Joe Biden <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-elections/wisconsin-president-results?icid=election_usmap" target="_blank">won the battleground state</a> by about 20,000 votes.</p> <p class="">Trump called after the Wisconsin Supreme Court issued a ruling that <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/wisconsin-supreme-court-bars-absentee-ballot-drop-boxes-elections-offi-rcna37275" target="_blank">restricted the use</a> of <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/republicans-eager-align-trump-zero-restricting-drop-boxes-mail-ballots-n1288074" target="_blank">absentee ballot drop boxes</a> in future elections. Trump tried to convince Vos that the ruling should apply retroactively, which Vos told him was not possible.</p> <p class="">Vos' refusal to try to throw out the election results led Trump to campaign against his re-election. Vos, who is the longest-serving speaker in Wisconsin history, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/robin-vos-wins-trump-wisconsin-rcna42413">ultimately</a> prevailed in his primary, but by only 3 percentage points — the smallest margin in his political career. He was recently re-elected as speaker.</p> <p class="">Wisconsin Democrats previously criticized Vos for appropriating close to $700,000 to investigate the state’s 2020 election results. The investigation turned up no evidence of widespread fraud, and Vos later said the election had not been stolen.</p> <p class="">A spokesperson for the Jan. 6 committee declined to comment on Vos’ scheduled appearance. NBC News has asked Vos for comment.</p> <p class="">A federal judge on Monday <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-doesnt-absolute-immunity-efforts-overturn-2020-election-judge-sa-rcna59128" target="_blank">rejected Trump’s argument</a> that he has “absolute immunity” in response to a lawsuit alleging he committed civil rights violations in his attempts to challenge the 2020 presidential election results.</p> <p class="">The House committee has held a series of interviews with former Trump officials in recent weeks.</p> <p class="">Kellyanne Conway, who was a senior counselor to Trump from the beginning of his term through August 2020, met with the panel for <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/kellyanne-conway-appears-jan-6-committee-rcna58963" target="_blank">nearly five hours</a> Monday.</p> <p class="">On Tuesday, former deputy White House chief of staff <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/secret-service-official-center-explosive-jan-6-testimony-retires-agenc-rcna45396" target="_blank">Tony Ornato</a> was <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/former-trump-deputy-chief-staff-ornato-key-witness-jan-6-appear-house-rcna59138" target="_blank">set to appear</a> for an interview before the committee, a person familiar with the panel’s plans said.</p> <p class="endmark">The committee is <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/jan-6-committee-staffers-told-preliminary-plan-final-report-focus-larg-rcna56802" target="_blank">expected soon to release a final report</a> detailing the findings of its investigation. The panel is not expected to continue beyond January, when Republicans take control of the House.</p>
