<p class="">Democratic Rep. Mary Peltola has won a full two-year term representing Alaska in the U.S. House, NBC News projected Wednesday, defeating former governor and GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin.</p> <p class=""><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/democrat-mary-peltola-defeats-sarah-palin-special-election-become-firs-rcna45756" target="_blank">Peltola made history in August</a> when she became the first Alaska Native seated in Congress after she won the special election to replace longtime GOP Rep. Don Young, who <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/gop-rep-don-young-alaska-longest-serving-member-congress-dies-88-rcna20719" target="_blank">died in March</a> at the age of 88. </p> <p class="">Shortly after news broke that she had won a full term on Wednesday night, Peltola <a href="https://twitter.com/MaryPeltola/status/1595589374636441602" target="_blank">tweeted</a> "WE DID IT!!!"</p> <p class="">The outcome of the Nov. 8 election for the state's at-large House seat — as well as other contests, including for Senate  — had been delayed for weeks because of Alaska’s new ranked-choice voting system in which voters rank the candidates in order of preference.</p> <p class="">After the first round of voting, Peltola led Palin by more than 20 percentage points,<strong> </strong>with Republican Nick Begich, a scion of one of Alaska’s most well-known political families, in third. </p> <p class="">But because Peltola failed to win more than 50%, the voting went to a second round, with Begich eliminated and his votes redistributed to those voters’ second choice.</p> <p class="">Begich and Palin also competed in the August special election, making this contest a three-way rematch.</p> <p class="">Peltola’s victory is a blow to GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy and the Republicans, who were handed <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-elections/house-results?icid=election_nav" target="_blank">a razor-thin majority in this month’s midterm elections</a>. It means that a Democrat will hold the at-large House seat for the next two years, after Young and the GOP had controlled it for nearly five decades.</p> <p class="">Young took over the seat in 1973 after Democratic Rep. Nick Begich, the grandfather of this year’s candidate by the same name, was presumed to have been killed in a <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/hale-boggs-plane-vanishes-in-alaska-oct-16-1972-229692" target="_blank">plane crash.</a></p> <p class="">Even before the race had been called, Palin, the late Sen. John McCain’s running mate in the 2008 presidential election, announced that she was the <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2022/11/18/palin-first-to-sign-new-ballot-initiative-to-repeal-ranked-choice-voting/" target="_blank">first person to sign</a> a new ballot initiative to repeal Alaska’s ranked-choice voting system.</p> <p class="endmark">In the Senate contest, incumbent <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/sen-lisa-murkowski-wins-re-election-alaska-fending-trump-backed-challe-rcna58447" target="_blank">Republican Lisa Murkowski was re-elected Wednesday</a> after ranked-choice runoff rounds, fending off a GOP challenger backed by former President Donald Trump.</p>
