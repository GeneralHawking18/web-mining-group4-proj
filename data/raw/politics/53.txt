<p class="">Billionaire <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/twitter-elon-musk-timeline-what-happened-so-far-rcna57532" target="_blank">Elon Musk</a> said on Friday he would support <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/gov-ron-desantis-cruises-re-election-solidifying-gop-hold-florida-poli-rcna56196" target="_blank">Ron DeSantis</a> in 2024 if the Florida governor, who recently coasted to a second term, were to run for president.</p> <p class="">DeSantis earlier this month defeated Democratic opponent Charlie Crist by nearly 20 percentage points to be re-elected as Florida governor and cemented himself as the Republican Party’s top rising star.</p> <p class="">Political pundits have been doling out high marks to DeSantis, who is seen as a potential challenger to former President <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump" target="_blank">Donald Trump</a> in the 2024 field of Republican presidential candidates. Trump announced 10 days ago he was <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-announce-president-2024-rcna36987" target="_blank">running for election</a> again in 2024.</p> <p class="">“My preference for the 2024 presidency is someone sensible and centrist. I had hoped that would the case for the Biden administration, but have been disappointed so far,” Musk said on Twitter.</p> <p class="">“Yes,” he replied in a tweet when asked if he would support DeSantis in 2024.</p> <p class="">“As a reminder, I was a significant supporter of the Obama-Biden presidency and (reluctantly) voted for Biden over Trump,” the Twitter owner said.</p> <p class="">Musk had previously said in June he was leaning towards supporting DeSantis for president in 2024, and added the Florida governor would easily defeat Biden in the election.</p> <p class="">When asked back then about Musk’s support, DeSantis joked, “I welcome support from African-Americans, what can I say.” </p> <p class="">Musk, who is white, grew up in <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/africa" target="_blank">South Africa</a>.</p> <p class="">DeSantis is especially popular with conservatives for taking the lead on culture war issues concerning race and gender. His governorship has been marked by his rejection of <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/coronavirus" target="_blank">pandemic-related health restrictions</a>, passage of a law limiting discussion of LGBTQ issues in schools, and a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/coronavirus" target="_blank">feud with Walt Disney</a> over the law.</p> <p class="">Musk urged Americans to elect a Republican Congress in the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/midterm-elections-2022" target="_blank">midterm elections</a> earlier this month to counterbalance Biden’s Democrats. </p> <p class="endmark">However, the Democrats defied Republican hopes for a “red wave” in the midterms and retained control of the Senate while the Republicans only won a narrow majority in the House of Representatives.</p>
