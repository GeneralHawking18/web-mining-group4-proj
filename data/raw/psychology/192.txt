Suzanne Drinkwater woke up in summer last year to find her boyfriend dead in the bed beside her and she decided to take her own life- the couple's bodies would eventually be found there A woman tragically killed herself after waking up to find her boyfriend dead in their bed beside her. Suzanne Drinkwater woke up one morning in the summer last year and was horrified when she found her boyfriend 35-year-old Gavin Massey, was dead next to her. The heartbroken 32-year-old from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, took her own life that morning in the very same bed. When the couple were finally found after police bashed down their front door, one of the bodies was decomposing. She had been receiving help for a number of psychiatric conditions at the time of her death, the inquest into their deaths heard. Coroner Tom Osborne, sitting at Milton Keynes, heard how Gavin likely died from cardiomegaly, an enlarged heart, and left ventricular hypertrophy, worsened by the steroids he had been taking. His death was also exacerbated by a mixture of alcohol and drugs found in his system. The alarm was raised after Suzanneâ€™s sister had been unable to contact her from August 4, and on August 7, she raised her fears with police. One day after that, they discovered the couple dead after police were forced to break into their home. There was no criticism of the agencies which had been helping both patients, during the joint inquest. The Samaritans is available 24/7 if you need to talk.
