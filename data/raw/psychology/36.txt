The woman claims two hooded youths approached her property on Almond Tree Avenue in Coventry, at around 10.30pm last Wednesday and began hurling eggs at her windows and a brick at her car A terrified mum-of-two has said she and her two autistic sons have been left 'on edge" after her home was wrongly targeted in an attack. The woman, who has not been named, claims two hooded youths approached her property on Almond Tree Avenue in Coventry, at around 10.30pm last Wednesday and began hurling eggs at her windows. A few minutes later, after hearing a noise sounding like "someone had been shot", she realised the rear windscreen of her car had been shattered by a brick. It is said to have caused both emotional and financial distress for the victim as the car that was damaged was a courtesy car that she was using while her own vehicle was being repaired. She told CoventryLive : "A neighbour came down, heard the noise, thought someone had been shot. Initially I thought just eggs had been thrown at the house, then I realised my car had been damaged." Speaking about the emotional impact the random attack has had on her family, the victim said: "I live alone with my two autistic boys, one has just turned 21 and the egg hit his bedroom window. He is very on edge." She believes that her home was wrongly targeted, saying: "I believe it may be mistaken address for a targeted attack, as we rarely go out or interact with people locally - keep ourselves to ourselves." A spokesman for West Midlands Police said: "We've received a report of criminal damage after a brick was thrown at a car in Almond Tree Avenue, Coventry, at 10.20pm on Wednesday (April 13).
