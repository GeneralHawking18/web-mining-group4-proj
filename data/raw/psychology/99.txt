Golf pro gives lesson to brave William Verden, 16, who is being kept alive using dialysis and is at the centre of a court battle with doctors over his treatment Right-to-life battle teen William Verden enjoys a golf lesson – as his family gets ready for a court fight. The 16-year-old golf fan – battling kidney failure – was thrilled to get tips from pro Trevor Newsham. The Sunday People told last month how William, who also has autism, is kept alive by gruelling dialysis sessions, and doctors at Manchester Children’s Hospital say that his only option now is palliative care. Mum Amy and dad Will, disagree – arguing their son, who has focal ­segmental glomerulosclerosis, has a good quality of life and can even play golf twice a week. Trevor, 34, was impressed with his swing saying: “He seemed really bright, taking it on board and hit great shots. He’s got some ability.” Amy, 45, of Newton, Lancs, said after Friday’s session at Heysham Golf Club in Morecambe: “It was great. He loved it”. She and Will are now preparing to make an application to court after it was agreed medical mediation is “not the right approach”.
