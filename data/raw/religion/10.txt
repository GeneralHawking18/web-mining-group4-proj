<div class="_3xX726aBn29LDbsDtzr_6E _1Ap4F5maDtT1E1YuCiaO0r D3IL3FD0RFy_mkKLPwL4" style="max-width:800px" data-click-id="text" data-adclicklocation="media"><div class="_292iotee39Lmt0MkQZ2hPV RichTextJSON-root"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">There is no evidence from the NT that the gospels were authored by eyewitnesses: they are undeniably written anonymously and in the third person and contain no accidental or intentional references by the authors to suggest that they were present for the events or dialog related there. Furthermore, the consensus of academic scholars is that the earliest gospel (Mark) was written two generations after Jesus' death, the last (John) written three generations after.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Furthermore, even by tradition, two of the gospels (Mark and Luke) were not authored by eyewitnesses, and "Luke" was a merely a companion of Paul, who himself was not an eyewitness. Furthermore, the Gospel of John contains text that suggests the author(s) were not eyewitnesses. Finally, the earliest reliable reference to the gospels we have under the names of the four evangelists comes about a century after the synoptics were written**, suggesting that the "authors" were an invention of much later Christians.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">In other words, there are very good reasons to believe not only that the gospel were not authored by eyewitnesses -- let alone the ones whose names they bear in modern Bibles -- but that we literally have no idea who wrote them,  which is the consensus of academic scholars, which means we have no idea if they even got their information from eyewitnesses.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Despite this, most Christians insist that the <em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE">tradition</em> handed down by earlier Christians concerning  who wrote the gospels is unquestionably accurate**. This is what most Christians teach their children, it a common "fact" cited in Christian stories and sermons, and Christian apologetics frequently rely heavily on the assumption that the gospels were written by the named eyewitnesses (Matthew &amp; John) or their close companions (Mark &amp; Luke). For instance, see <a href="https://navigatingbyfaith.com/2020/11/09/the-case-for-jesus-christ-rests-on-the-evidence-of-eyewitnesses/" class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">"The Case for Jesus Christ Rests on the Evidence of Eyewitnesses"</a>.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">But it seems extremely odd that Christians feel the need to insist that this is true. After all, the gospels undeniably contain accounts of events and dialog that the named eyewitnesses could not have been (or were very unlikely to be) present to witness. Examples include events related to Jesus' birth and baptism, events related to Jesus' arrest and trial and execution, events on the day of the discovery of the empty tomb.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Many Christians believe that the gospel accounts of these events are completely accurate -- and for large numbers of Christians, that these events even literally happened as described -- despite the lack of eyewitness testimony. Why? Because both Protestant and Catholic Christians generally believe that the NT was "authored" by God, who used the Holy Spirit to divinely inspire the authors of the gospels to write only what God wanted written and to write it completely accurately. For instance, here's what the  Catechism of the Catholic church says</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE">" God is the author of Sacred Scripture because he inspired its human authors; he acts in them and by means of them. He thus gives assurance that their writings teach without error his saving truth"</em></p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And here's what the <a href="https://www.namb.net/apologetics/resource/the-three-i-s-of-scripture-inspired-interrant-infallible/" class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">Southern Baptist North American Mission Board</a> has to say:</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE">"God breathed out His Word by using godly men to write down exactly what He wanted them to write. ... The Bible is inspired: God is its ultimate author. The Bible is inerrant: God used human authors to write exactly what He wanted without error. The Bible is infallible: It is incapable of error and will accomplish exactly what God wants.</em></p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">But here's the problem: if Christians <em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE">really believe</em> this, why does it matter who wrote the gospels, why does it matter that the authors of the gospels were eyewitnesses? Anyone could have written the gospels inerrantly if in fact it was ultimately God who was telling them "exactly what to write" and was ensuring that what they wrote was "without error".</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I propose that the only reasonable explanation is that -- lip service aside -- these Christians who insist the gospels had to be written by eyewitnesses no longer <em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE">actually</em> have faith that the NT was divinely "authored" by God via the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, which is understandable, because it's frankly hard to reconcile such a belief with the numerous discrepancies (and other problems) that are obviously present in the gospels (as we see presented on virtually a daily basis in this sub). In other words, they lack faith that these texts were actually divinely inspired, and so hope to bolster the reliability of the gospels by claiming they are eyewitness testimony, something that should be completely unnecessary if they were divinely inspired.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">As an aside, let me also explain why I think this is unethical / dangerous:</p><ul class="_33MEMislY0GAlB78wL1_CR"><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">It's a common tactic for religious cults to hide their dirty laundry from their children and new recruits, to lead them along with simple and easy stories and beliefs until they are safely "in the fold", only for them to later discover that the reality is not what they were taught. As one of many examples, we know Scientologists hid information about Xenu from the rank and file for decades, only exposing it to a select few. Obviously, such behavior is deceptive and unethical.</p></li><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">It's also extremely brittle. Just like it's very easy these days for Scientologists to learn about Xenu, it's very easy these days for Christians to get exposed to the academic consensus concerning the authorship of the gospels -- a consensus that's generally pretty easy to validate on your own by reading the relevant portions of the NT and 2nd-century references -- which means that this alone can act as a wedge that starts Christians questioning the truth of what they have been taught.</p></li></ul><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">In my opinion, this is one of several serious clefts in Christian belief that is adding to the exodus of Christians from the faith. Christians need to decide whether the NT is accurate because it's divinely inspired -- in which case they need to come up with a reasonable explanation for how it can be so problematic -- or that it is accurate because it was written by eyewitnesses or people relying on the direct testimony of eyewitnesses -- which is going to be a tough sell for the reasons described above -- or some other TBD explanation.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">[** The one well-known exception I should address is Papias, who later church fathers quote as claiming that there were "writings" attributed to Matthew and Mark in the very early second century. The well-established problem is that the description of these "writings" does not match the gospels attributed to those evangelists in the NT. Specifically, Papias states that Matthew's writings were in Hebrew, whereas the scholarly consensus is that the Gospel of Matthew was <em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE">originally</em> written in Greek, and also suggests these consist just of <em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE">logia</em> , or "divine sayings, especially one spoken by Jesus". Likewise, he says that Mark "made it his one concern not to omit anything he had heard", which is hard to believe applies to the Gospel of Mark, since that gospel lacks things like the Lord's Prayer or any stories about Jesus appearing after his resurrection. As a result, Papias is not only not a reliable attribution concerning who wrote the gospels, he demonstrates why it's reasonable to question the accuracy of the "tradition" handed down by the earliest Christians.]</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  "  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  "  >  T  h  e     i  n  s  i  s  t  e  n  c  e     b  y     m  o  s  t     C  h  r  i  s  t  i  a  n  s     t  h  a  t     t  h  e     g  o  s  p  e  l  s     w  e  r  e     a  u  t  h  o  r  e  d     b  y     e  y  e  w  i  t  n  e  s  s  e  s     s  h  o  w  s     t  h  e  y     l  a  c  k     f  a  i  t  h     t  h  a  t     t  h  e     H  o  l  y     S  p  i  r  i  t     d  i  v  i  n  e  l  y     i  n  s  p  i  r  e  d     t  h  e  s  e     t  e  x  t  s  <  /  h  1  >
