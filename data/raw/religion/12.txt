It also claims to contain the sayings and teachings of the Son of this God, and the Teacher who paved the way to salvation. The problem is, this is simply not true. The Bible contains numerous contradictions, errors, barbarism, absurdities, and other embarrassing things, some of which will be listed below.  Others will follow if necessary. I would like to do this kind of post in regards to other holy books, like the Quran or BoM, but that’s for another time. Contradictions: A really awkward one appears in Chronicles and Samuel. There’s a story where David has a census, and god gets ticked off. Then he makes a bunch of people in Israel get sick. It’s a fairly straightforward story, but there exists a serious contradiction. One account says that God rose up against Israel, but another said that it was Satan. Another one exists in the genealogy of Jesus (a minor one, but still). They are wildly different, which obviously doesn’t bode well. Or perhaps you could consult Moses. He says he saw God in Genesis 32, but John 1:18 says that no one has seen god. Which is it? Is Moses lying? Is he wrong? On the subject of morals, the Bible clearly has none. In the OT, slavery, rape, and genocide are all condoned by god to various degrees.Numbers 31, deut 20, and 1 Samuel 15 are the best examples. God permits slavery in passages like Lev 20, Ex 20-21, and others. Deuteronomy 22 says that a raped woman must marry her rapist. That’s messed up. Numbers 31:18 says that kidnapping young Midianite girls and taking them for sex slaves is fine. And on and on and on.<br>For errors, the Bible has them in abundance. It repeatedly makes claims that are simply not true. It claims that there was a mass exodus from Egypt by Israel (I’ve also done a debate about this in this sub recently too) it claims that a senior citizen with no shipbuilding knowledge built a giant boat with all the animals. That is plainly ridiculous. It also talks about a garden of Eden, which doesn’t exist. There are still more, and I wouldn’t just unload them all on the first post. My point is this: the Bible cannot be trusted in its moral, historical, or scientific claims. If none of these claims hold to basic scrutiny, how can it be the word of God?</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  "  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  "  >  T  h  e     B  i  b  l  e     i  s     n  o  t     d  i  v  i  n  e  l  y     i  n  s  p  i  r  e  d  .  <  /  h  1  >
