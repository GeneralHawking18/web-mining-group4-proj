<div class="_3xX726aBn29LDbsDtzr_6E _1Ap4F5maDtT1E1YuCiaO0r D3IL3FD0RFy_mkKLPwL4" style="max-width:800px" data-click-id="text" data-adclicklocation="media"><div class="_292iotee39Lmt0MkQZ2hPV RichTextJSON-root"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">You might think this is going to be some long winded thing about "god" not having any right to dictate our lives but no. The simple fact is this: "god" has no right to judge any of us as he isn't fit to. A judge has no right to judge if they won't even follow their own rules and laws.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">"God" says not to murder (And he is right with this one. Murder is entirely immoral. Self defense is one thing but murder is not right) but then turns around and kills numerous people. One can argue the instances of him ordering followers to kill others as self-defense (Though that is wrong because they murdered babies and children in cold blood NOT self-defense) but when "god" directly kills or causes deaths? He sins. As nothing poses a threat to him so it cannot be self-defense thus it is cold blooded  murder no matter how you try to justify it.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Then there is "god's love" which again is a lie. "god" has no love and thus is nothing</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">What does the Bible itself say?</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">1 Corinthians 13: 1-13</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">If I give all I possess to the poor and surrender my body to the flames, but have not love, I gain nothing.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">For we know in part and we prophesy in part, but when perfection comes, the imperfect disappears.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put childish ways behind me.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">"god" however is jealous. "god" gets angered easily. "god" does keep track of your wrong doings and only forgets them with conditions you must meet.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">In all honesty "god" being afraid of us makes what Jesus said make more sense. Jesus came to divide us. To set us upon one another. Father against son, mother against daughter.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And really that is all that needs to be said. Just this things bars him from having any right to judge us. And proves that the "god" of the christian bible is either nothing, the Bible is entirely wrong, or that the bible is made up. And writing this I had an epiphany: What if that is the point of the Bible? To show that absolutely no one has the right to judge someone else not even "god"? And let me guess... "if "god" is scared of us then he has the right to kill us in self-defense." No. Killing to stay in power is also sinful and wrong. These things are in the Bible itself so you as christians CANNOT deny them. That would mean you are denying your bibles. Or perhaps the Gnostic faith is right and Jesus was a double agent chosen by the real God to give us the answer on how to deal with the fake "god"</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">EDIT: What if... what if the Bible is a mirror? What you see and are angered by is a reflection of the self? And the message is God will not judge you ever because he is said to be love thus if God won't judge you becuse he is love what right do you have to judge others? What right do you have to not love others?</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  "  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  "  >  T  h  e     C  h  r  i  s  t  i  a  n     "  G  o  d  "     i  s     n  o  t     f  i  t     t  o     j  u  d  g  e     a  n  y  o  n  e     a  n  d     i  s     s  c  a  r  e  d     o  f     u  s     b  e  c  a  u  s  e     h  e     i  s     n  o  t  h  i  n  g  .  <  /  h  1  >
