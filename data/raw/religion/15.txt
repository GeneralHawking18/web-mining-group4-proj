If we critically examine our "givens" -- the pieces of information we are taking for granted or assuming <em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE">a priori</em> -- we will find that a lot of the arguments about religion are based on assumptions that are unsound. I believe the best example of this is the brute fact of existence.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The question has famously been asked, "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_there_is_anything_at_all" class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">Why is there anything at all?</a>" or "Why is there something rather than nothing?" There can't be a causal answer to this question, nothing can "cause" existence, because the cause must have existed. If we pull this string far enough, we are forced to accept the Brute Fact of Existence. Something simply was, and we cannot pull the string any farther.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The brute fact of existence has devastating consequences for the ideological framework that underscores religious arguments and demonstrates how that framework is infected by biased thinking and assumptions. The idea that something "simply exists" is intuitively offensive to mankind. The lack of an explanation is an assault on the senses, and our pattern recognition immediately seeks one. "God" is a prophylactic for this problem. The mysterious, reverent, and all-powerful nature of such a thing is easier to accept in the circumstances, however, to accept it is to not critical examine our givens.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">We must accept that something "simply exists." How we extrapolate this fact is extremely perilous. Every single religious argument does so by refusing to critical examine their givens. I will go through the main arguments and demonstrate this.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Argument from Contingency:</strong></p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The argument from contingency claims that some things are "contingent" and other things are "necessary" and that contingent things depend on necessary things to exist. It could be said, for example, that an atom "depends on" protons, neutrons, and electrons to exist, and in that way it is "contingent."</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">However, this does not let us arrive at deity, as science knows that there are fundamental particles that are not composed of other things, which satisfy this specific rendition of "necessary" vs "contingent."</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">There are other renditions, but they fail to withstand scrutiny. For example, it has been proposed that the fact that particles move within spacetime and can be moved by other particles suggests that they are contingent, but this is clearly dissimilar to the "compositional" contingency referred to earlier, and shouldn't be conflated. We have gone from "composed of other things" vs "not composed of other things" to "unchangeable/immoveable" vs "changeable/movable."</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This does not withstand scrutiny, as there is no basis for supposing that "non-compositional" objects must also be "immoveable." It's merely a semantic sleight-of-hand to compile both attributes into this framework called "contingency." Remember that we are scrutinizing our "givens." Why do we assume that the brute fact of existence constitutes an "immoveable/unchangeable" object? After all, location and existence are not identical concepts, and it cannot be said that a particle stops existing once it moves elsewhere.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">First Cause</strong></p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The above argument flows quite neatly into the first cause argument, which supposes that the causal chain of reality must hit a stopping point, which is therefore God. This approach also fails to critical examine one's givens.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">For an object to exist, it must have properties. We know that there is something rather than nothing. This something has properties.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Given that something simply exists, we must ask -- what reason do we have to dictate the properties of this initial something as being conscious or divine? There cannot be a causal mechanism for the initial state of affairs, definitionally, and given the brute fact of existence, we have to accept that this state simply was. Therefore, what reason do we have to assume that it is something resembling a divine personal conscious deity, rather than a Big Bang scenario, like the one we actually know existed?</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This is, of course, assuming that there was an "initial state" at all rather than a perpetual state of change, which is another poorly scrutinized "given." Physicists do not regard the finitism of the universe as a foregone conclusion, it's still very much an open question!</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Some shift this to say that it's not about the universe or it's finitism, but rather, suggesting there is a different causal axis that God would be on, that must exist for the universe to have it's causal chain. Again, we must scrutinize our assumptions. If this were true, we would be accepting that a deity "simply exists" and set our universe into motion. Why would we assume that rather than the possibility that the universe necessarily had the function of being in motion, or being poised to set into motion in it's initial state?</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">An argument that relies on assigning properties to an eternal necessary being is indefensible, as those properties can quite easily apply to the natural universe.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Fine Tuning Argument</strong></p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Fine Tuning makes a similar error in it's failure to examine it's givens. We do not know if there was an initial state of existence or if the universe is infinite. Or at least, physicists don't know and I am not arrogant enough to place myself above them.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The argument goes that certain conditions within the universe allowed for life which, if altered, would not allow life. It's circularly obvious that if conditions allow for life, there are conceivable conditions which do not allow for life.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Sometimes the "compelling" portion of this argument relies on the claim that small changes would render life moot, so the universe must be "fine-tuned" for us to exist at all. However, this presupposes that there cannot be other forms of life which would've arisen in these other conditions. This argument merely represents our inability to "know what we don't know."</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This model can more or less be represented in every major religious argument -- a lack of scrutiny applied to <em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE">a priori</em> assumptions, and confirmation bias.</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  "  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  "  >  T  h  e     B  r  u  t  e     F  a  c  t     o  f     E  x  i  s  t  e  n  c  e     &  a  m  p  ;     C  o  n  f  i  r  m  a  t  i  o  n     B  i  a  s     -     a     f  a  t  a  l     f  l  a  w     i  n     e  v  e  r  y     r  e  l  i  g  i  o  u  s     a  r  g  u  m  e  n  t  <  /  h  1  >
