With that consideration in mind that throughout time there have been systems of belief created that were deemed "religions" at some point or another.</p></li></ul><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">There reason I wish to start with this point is that I want to introduce the notion that it is possible for humans to fabricate systems of belief, more specifically religions.</p><hr class="_2ACwpV3Y0LKhHHKbsxNmmY"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Throughout the history of religion, a point that was always problematic to me, was that many of them seemed to heavily rely on humans to relay the central "truth" of that given religion. Usually this is through "prophets" or similar in the whole "person in authority who communes with God" to then relay given messages on etc. Many of the God(s) of the worlds religions seemingly favor this approach; Judaism, the Baháʼí Religion, Islam, Native American Indian religions, Hinduism and Christianity, as a few examples.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">However, the reason this is problematic should be obvious. It is also the exact same way that any given charlatan or fraud would set about fabricating their own system of belief for others to follow, for nefarious reasons. If you had a mechanism to help you reliably, accurately and consistently discern, or test, whether a given person genuinely liaised with God, then this might aleviate some of the issues associated with that. Another issue is whether the human that God chose to impart a message to, heard it correctly or not, they are fallible humans, they could have misinterpreted the message.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">However, it seems quite clear that there is no mechanism that can reliably, accurately and consistently figure out whether a given person genuinely received instruction from God, nor whether the message they received, as a fallible humanbeing, was received correctly.</p><hr class="_2ACwpV3Y0LKhHHKbsxNmmY"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The following observations/comments that I feel are very reasonable, can be made.</p><ul class="_33MEMislY0GAlB78wL1_CR"><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">One. If man is simply fabricating systems of belief, based on idealistic fantasy, then it makes complete sense that the only mechanism for that message of "truth" to be circulated around, especially pre modern technology, was by oral tradition and/or writing it down.</p></li><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Two. Despite the general favoritism by many religions to use the above mentioned method, we have yet to have any God(s) associated with them to unmistakably clear up the confusion, "misinterpretation" and outright flaws in many of the messages passed on in that manner.</p></li><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Three. If there is no mechanism to reliably discern the validty of a "prophetic" claim or the claim of any given person to have "spoken" with God, then it makes any given set of beliefs that spawn out of that no more credible than any other. In fact, we have plenty of examples of clearly madeup/fabricated religious systems of belief which convinced many people to follow and some of those having resulted in atrocities (the Jonestown massacre an infamous example). You could quite credibly argue that we have contemporary examples in things like Mormonism as "made up".</p></li><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Three A. Another hallmark of there being no mechanism to fact or error check those claims, is that they will result in disagreements on those beliefs over time, resulting in people splitting off of a once central system of beliefs. As people disagree and with no way to reliably, accurately and consistently method confirm the truth of "God" communication, people can just make their own version of what they think is "true" and have the freedom to follow that and convince others it is true too.</p></li></ul><hr class="_2ACwpV3Y0LKhHHKbsxNmmY"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">To conclude: We know people make systems of beliefs up, that those systems can eventually make their way to be a "religious" belief is also entirely possible and a reasonable assumption. It is too much a conicidence that so many religions (particularly the major ones) rely on humans to spread their messages of truth, in place of some clearly/undeniable message which would be totally within the power of God(s) of those religions to impart on us (if they do actually exist). Considering the clear problems with the error-prone/fallible nature of humans, it makes no sense for any God(s) of different religions to constantly rely on them to impart the all-important truth. Furthermore, considering the amount of hatred, intolerence and bloodshed that has occurred as a result of specifically religious disagreements, it highlights how imperitive it is for the God(s) of those religions to clear the confusion up and/or use a more reliable system for their message.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Overall, almost everything you would expect from humans making up religious systems of belief, is almost exactly what we see of them, with plenty of undeniable examples. We don't see anything undeniably of "God(s/ly)" origin in the persistence of religious systems of belief, just slight variations of the same oral and/or written tradition. We see the same issues between religions (i.e denominations and shisms) and almost none of them presenting any reliable, accurate and consistent method to do away with "wrong" denominations/shisms and bring it back to the central truth.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Now of course this does not demonstrate with any direct conclusivity that all religions are simply man-made systems of belief. But it does provide several lines of evidence and good reasons to be incredibly suspect of all religions. That we should be expecting a high threshold of evidence and thorough demonstrations that address the issues above. If I were to focus on a specific issue it is that we have no way to tell the difference between someone who is insane, or intentially making things up when compared to someone who is a prophet or genuinely receiving instruction from God.</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  "  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  "  >  T  h  e     f  a  c  t     t  h  a  t     t  h  e     w  o  r  l  d  '  s     r  e  l  i  g  i  o  n  s     (  s  p  e  c  i  f  i  c  a  l  l  y     t  h  e     m  a  j  o  r     o  n  e  s  )     a  l  l     s  e  e  m  i  n  g  l  y     r  e  l  y     o  n     h  u  m  a  n     m  e  t  h  o  d  s     t  o     r  e  l  a  y     t  h  e     "  t  r  u  t  h  "     o  f     t  h  e  i  r     c  e  n  t  r  a  l     c  l  a  i  m  s     i  s     m  o  r  e     i  n  d  i  c  a  t  i  v  e     o  f     t  h  e  m     b  e  i  n  g     p  u  r  e  l  y     a     r  e  s  u  l  t     o  f     h  u  m  a  n     f  a  b  r  i  c  a  t  i  o  n     r  a  t  h  e  r     t  h  a  n     f  r  o  m     a  c  t  u  a  l     G  o  d  (  s  )  .  <  /  h  1  >
