<div class="_3xX726aBn29LDbsDtzr_6E _1Ap4F5maDtT1E1YuCiaO0r D3IL3FD0RFy_mkKLPwL4" style="max-width:800px" data-click-id="text" data-adclicklocation="media"><div class="_292iotee39Lmt0MkQZ2hPV RichTextJSON-root"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">When discussing the idea of whether morality exists objectively or subjectively, people will sometimes insist that God-given morality is not objective morality, that the only way morality could be objective is if not even God Himself could change it. But by that definition of objectivity, most things that exist would be subjective. God could change the universal coefficient of gravity, so gravity is subjective.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I think it should be considered from the other way around: rather than objective being considered "existing outside of the influence of <em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE">any</em> mind", it should be considered as "existing outside of the influence of <em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE">your</em> mind". For instance, Critic says Movie is an 8/10. That is a subjective rating; Critic could change their mind and say Movie is a 10/10 and it would be no less true than their first review. But at the same time, that subjective rating <em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE">objectively</em> exists; <em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE">you</em> cannot change <em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE">your</em> mind about what Critic believes and have it be equally true to what they actually, <em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE">objectively</em> believe.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">So from that conception of objectivity, if God exists, then even though He could change morality, even though it is subjective <em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE">to Him</em>, it is objective <em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE">to us</em>. Because it doesn't matter if you disagree with God, you don't change that reality by changing the state of <em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE">your</em> mind. Laws are subjective to the whims of the current government, but good luck arguing in any court that that means they don't objectively exist.</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  "  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  "  >  E  v  e  r  y  t  h  i  n  g     t  h  a  t     e  x  i  s  t  s  ,     e  x  i  s  t  s     o  b  j  e  c  t  i  v  e  l  y  <  /  h  1  >
