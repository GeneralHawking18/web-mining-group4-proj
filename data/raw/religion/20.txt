As Thomas Henry Huxley put it; “how it is that any thing so remarkable as a state of consciousness comes about as the result of irritating nervous tissue, is just as unaccountable as the appearance of the Djin when Aladdin rubbed his lamp.”</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">• Free will: many atheists dismiss free will, believing that the universe is deterministic in nature. This presents a problem, as Dr. Angus Menuge puts it; “before we can talk of being responsible for our decisions, we need an account of why those decisions belong to us. But the trouble is, on a naturalistic view, there is no entity that can plausibly own any mental states, there is simply a plurality of parallel, impersonal processes in the brain.”</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">• Purpose: the fact that we feel in us an intrinsic purpose contradicts the nihilism inherent in naturalism.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">• Reason (math, science, etc.): reason requires the existence of immaterial things, as C. S. Lewis puts it: “If minds are wholly dependent on brains, and brains on biochemistry, and biochemistry (in the long run) on the meaningless flux of the atoms, I cannot understand how the thought of those minds should have any more significance than the sound of the wind in the trees.”</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">• Objective moral facts: what justification is there that obviously bad things are “bad”? As Stuart Goetz and Charles Taliafero put it, “it is not clear how one can establish normative values on the basis of processes that are ultimately thoroughly unconscious, nonnormative, and contingent in nature.”</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">In conclusion, there are a variety of immaterial things that naturalism cannot explain, so it is therefore impossible for it to be true.</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  "  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  "  >  A  r  g  u  m  e  n  t  s     a  g  a  i  n  s  t     n  a  t  u  r  a  l  i  s  m  .  <  /  h  1  >
