A sand grain size piece of universe , holds thousands of Galaxies, containing thousands of planets.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Unless we believe the scriptures to be not complete or your God of choice deliberately withholding information from mankind, it makes zero sense why God doesn't talk about alien life (did the Zorgons get a visit by Jesus?) on other places than earth or potential for life expanding beyond earth.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The most logical conclusion would God doesn't know about it i.e  the prophet was a regular human being who wrote the book and was limited by the knowledge of the times.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Let's assume that all the space IS empty . There's only human beings out in the infinite void on a small dust ball. Still, you'd think God would talk about something as monumental as humans moving out of their original home of Earth (even the moon landing!) and settling in the stars but nope, he drops no wisdom on it. The maximum distance he talks about getting stuff done in by mankind is the four corners of the earth.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">So here is my point, God in religion is man made because God it creates is limited by the knowledge of men than. What are your views on this.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Personally, why does no religion's God talk about alien life or human life becoming multiplanetary seems to be because he is a human construct.</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  "  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  "  >  T  h  e     l  a  c  k     o  f     G  o  d     t  a  l  k  i  n  g     a  b  o  u  t     l  i  f  e     o  n     o  t  h  e  r     p  l  a  n  e  t  s     o  r     h  u  m  a  n  s     c  o  l  o  n  i  s  i  n  g     s  p  a  c  e     s  e  e  m  s     l  i  k  e     a     c  a  s  e     f  o  r     h  i  m     b  e  i  n  g     a     h  u  m  a  n     c  o  n  s  t  r  u  c  t  <  /  h  1  >
