Dead brain = dead consciousness. You will no longer continue to have experience for as long as time continues to churn.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I do feel as though a lot of us non-theists take eternal oblivion for granted, and the most basic assumption for the question "what happens after we die", I do believe there are small holes to this theory.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">A lot of this mainly comes from the anecdotes (unfortunately) of hundreds of people who have had near-death experiences. For the sake of the argument, let's ignore cases that could potentially be explained "hypoxia" "DMT"...etc. Mainly cases that do conveniently seem like hallucinations of otherworldly dimensions, of heaven, of hell...etc.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Instead, veridical near death experiences, in which the experiencer is highly unlikely to have conscious awareness of anything, is able to have awareness of events that can be corroborated. 'Peak in Darien' experiences are also interesting as they involve cases in which the experiencer has visions of people that, unbeknownst to them, were dead.  Brain activity is thought to cease 10-20 seconds after cardiac arrest. Brain damage from hypoxia/cardiac arrest is thought to ensue in 9-10 minutes. In many of these cases, flat EEGs were observed, and the experience is thought to have occurred during the time frame of minuscule brain activity.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Under a purely physical conception of the mind (my views still align mainly with physicalism), it seems intuitively impossible for such an experience to occur. Yet, in both NDE types, the experience seems to pick up on information they shouldn't have picked up on.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The most well-known case seems to be that of Pam Reynolds;</p><blockquote class="_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">In 1991, aged 35, Reynolds experienced symptoms of dizziness, loss of speech and difficulty moving her body. A CT scan revealed a giant aneurysm at the base of her brain. The neurologist to whom she was referred predicted little or no chance of survival; because of its size and location, regular neurosurgical techniques to excise it would not work. She was then referred to Dr Robert Spetzler in Phoenix, Arizona, who had pioneered a surgical procedure, hypothermic cardiac arrest, that would make the aneurysm operable. This involved cooling the patient’s body to sixty degrees Fahrenheit, stopping the heartbeat and breathing, and draining all blood from the brain.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">More than twenty doctors, nurses and technicians took part. The operation required Reynolds’s vital signs and body temperature to be very closely monitored by multiple instruments placed in various locations on and within her body. Molded speakers were placed in her ears, producing clicks at regular intervals, so that other instruments could detect her brain’s reactions to them.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Reynolds was awake when she was brought into the operating room at 7:15 am. She felt a ‘loss of time’ and blanked out as the general anaesthesia took effect. Then she became aware of a musical tone that seemed to pull her out of the top of her head.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">The further out of my body I got, the more clear the tone became. I had the impression it was like a road, a frequency that you go on … I remember seeing several things in the operating room when I was looking down. It was the most aware that I think that I have ever been in my entire life … It was brighter and more focused and clearer than normal vision … There was so much in the operating room that I didn’t recognize, and so many people.</strong></p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">She recalled being surprised that the team had only partially shaved her head. She also recalled seeing the bone-saw Spetzler used to excise a section of her skull:</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">The saw thing … looked like an electric toothbrush and it had a dent in it, a groove at the top where the saw appeared to go into the handle, but it didn’t … And the saw had interchangeable blades, too, but these blades were in what looked like a socket wrench case … I heard the saw crank up.</strong></p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">She found this sound unpleasant. <strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">‘Someone said something about my veins and arteries being very small,’ Reynolds recalled, adding that it was a female voice. At this stage in the operation, a female cardiac surgeon, having determined that the arteries in Reynolds’s right leg were too small to handle the degree of blood flow required by the heart-lung machine, opened the left leg as well.</strong></p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Spetzler assessed the aneurysm and ordered hypothermic cardiac arrest to be performed. Commencing at 10:50 am, blood was removed via tubes from the femoral arteries and veins, chilled in reservoir cylinders and returned to her body. As Reynolds’s core temperature fell, her heartbeat changed to fibrillation, then stopped entirely. Her brainwaves flattened, then, as her core temperature reached sixty, the brainstem shut down. By standard definitions she was clinically dead.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">At 11:25 the heart-lung machine was turned off, the operating table was tilted and blood was drained from her body. The sac of the aneurysm, now empty, was easily excised. The heart-lung machine was then reactivated and warmed blood reinfused into Reynolds’s circulatory system. The brainstem slowly began showing activity again, then her higher brain also, as the warming process continued. At noon it became apparent that her heart would not resume beating by warming alone; electrical jolts from a defibrillator were used to shock it into starting. Having been clinically dead for about an hour, Reynolds was returned to the recovery room in a stable condition at 2:10 pm.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">As cited by Sabom, Reynolds’s next recollections fall between the mention of her arteries being too small, and the time Spetzler’s younger assistants were closing her incisions:</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">There was a sensation like being pulled, but not against your will. I was going on my own accord because I wanted to go. I have different metaphors to try to explain this. It was like the Wizard of Oz – being taken up in a tornado vortex, only you’re not spinning around like you’ve got vertigo. You’re very focused and you have a place to go. The feeling was like going up in an elevator real fast. And there was a sensation, but it wasn’t a bodily, physical sensation. It was like a tunnel but it wasn’t a tunnel. At some point very early in the tunnel vortex I became aware of my grandmother calling me. But I didn’t hear her call me with my ears … It was a clearer hearing than with my ears. I trust that sense more than I trust my own ears. The feeling was that she wanted me to come to her, so I continued with no fear down the shaft. It’s a dark shaft that I went through, and at the very end there was this very little tiny pinpoint of light that kept getting bigger and bigger and bigger. The light was incredibly bright, like sitting in the middle of a lightbulb. It was so bright that I put my hands in front of my face fully expecting to see them and I could not. But I knew they were there. Not from a sense of touch. Again, it’s terribly hard to explain, but I knew they were there … I noticed that as I began to discern different figures in the light – and they were all covered with light, they were light, and had light permeating all around them – they began to form shapes I could recognize and understand. I could see that one of them was my grandmother. I don’t know if it was reality or projection, but I would know my grandmother, the sound of her, anytime, anywhere.Everyone I saw, looking back on it, fit perfectly into my understanding of what that person looked like at their best during their lives. I recognized a lot of people. My uncle Gene was there. So was my great-great-Aunt Maggie, who was really a cousin. On Papa’s side of the family, my grandfather was there … They were specifically taking care of me, looking after me.They would not permit me to go further … It was communicated to me – that’s the best way I know how to say it, because they didn’t speak like I’m speaking – that if I went all the way into the light something would happen to me physically. They would be unable to put this me back into the body me, like I had gone too far and they couldn’t reconnect. So they wouldn’t let me go anywhere or do anything. Then they were feeding me. They were not doing this through my mouth, like with food, but they were nourishing me with something. The only way I know how to put it is something sparkly. Sparkles is the image that I get. I definitely recall the sensation of being nurtured and being fed and being made strong. I know it sounds funny, because obviously it wasn’t a physical thing, but inside the experience I felt physically strong, ready for whatever. My grandmother didn’t take me back through the tunnel, or even send me back or ask me to go. She just looked up at me. I expected to go with her, but it was communicated to me that she just didn’t think she would do that. My uncle said he would do it. He’s the one who took me back through the end of the tunnel. Everything was fine. I did want to go. But then I got to the end of it and saw the thing, my body. I didn’t want to get into it … It looked terrible, like a train wreck. It looked like what it was: dead. I believe it was covered. It scared me and I didn’t want to look at it. It was communicated to me that it was like jumping into a swimming pool. No problem, just jump right into the swimming pool. I didn’t want to, but I guess I was late or something because he [the uncle] pushed me. I felt a definite repelling and at the same time a pulling from the body. The body was pulling and the tunnel was pushing … It was like diving into a pool of ice water … It hurt!</strong><style class="mov-2-h" data-href="chunkCSS/UsersCountIndicator.2ab8dda40f822a31d31c_.css">._1W1pLIfaIb8rYU6YeTdAk6{margin-right:6px}._1H6Meh6ZAemKxOJDOEasfK{border-radius:50%;box-sizing:border-box;height:20px;margin-left:-8px;width:20px}._1H6Meh6ZAemKxOJDOEasfK:first-child{margin-left:0}._30vlMmCcnqKnXP1t-fzm0e{display:inline-block;margin-left:-8px;position:relative}

[laughter] When I regained consciousness, I was still on the respirator.11</strong></p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">As measured by the Greyson NDE scale, Reynolds’s NDE was particularly deep. The maximum score possible is 32, the average score among Greyson’s subjects at the time of Sabom’s writing was 15, and the average among the subjects in Sabom’s study was 13.3.  Reynolds scored 27.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">After her experience, Reynolds lost all fear of death. She said, as quoted in a MSNBC broadcast: <strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">‘If death is the worst thing that happens to us, what an incredible thing! If at the end of our lives, this is what’s going to happen to everyone, I don’t see the problem, I really don’t get it. I fear pain, but I don’t fear death’.12</strong></p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Pam Reynolds recovered fully from the operation and lived a healthy life until 2010, when she died aged 53 of heart failure.</p></blockquote><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Events from this purported NDE have been corroborated by the surgeons performing the operation, such as:</p><ul class="_33MEMislY0GAlB78wL1_CR"><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The mentioning of the arteries being too small</p></li><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">the surgical drill used</p></li><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">the song that was played at the end of the operation</p></li><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Head-shaving</p></li></ul><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Critics have argued that the case could be another regular ol' case of anaesthesia awareness, but certain events of the NDE seem to have occurred during the time period after the anaesthesia was administered, the blood was drained from the brain and the body temperature was chilled. There are lots of back and forth papers between skeptics like Keith Augustine and G.W. Woerlee and proponents like Chris Carter.

Here he watched the person who was house-sitting for him and his wife while they were in Wisconsin. Coming out of the coma, he reported to his wife a sequence of many amazing, very specific, as well as out-of-the-ordinary details that he had observed in their home. These reports were confirmed later, both by discussions with the house-sitter as well as by their own 236 GARY R.

Startled by the noise, Greyson dropped his fork, splashing tomato sauce everywhere, including on his tie. He cursed under his breath as he wiped the sauce off with a wet napkin. It would leave a stain that would change the course of his life. </p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">As Greyson details in his book <em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE">After: A Doctor Explores What Near-Death Experiences Reveal About Life and Beyond,</em> after dialling the number on the pager’s display, he learned that a woman called Holly was in the emergency room following a drug overdose.

There Holly’s roommate Susan was pacing back and forth. Feeling a little hot in the windowless room, Greyson undid his lab coat and moved a fan closer to him, before sitting down to talk to Susan.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">He questioned Susan about her roommate, trying to establish if Holly may have been doing drugs or suffering from mental health problems. At one point he thought he saw Susan shudder slightly.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">After concluding the chat, he returned to Holly’s room where she was still out cold, a ‘sitter’ confirming that she hadn’t stirred since he left the room.

More non-anecdotal studies have to be done on this phenomenon, which is what the AWARE I and AWARE II studies are attempting to do, before we may fully suggest that the mind can continue to be aware of things after clinical death.
