You should worship God because he is Good.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">But is that really why you worship God? I posit that that isn't at all why people worship God, because it doesn't really matter if God is Good. It doesn't really matter if God is Evil.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Atheists and skeptics will push back and cast doubt on the idea that God is Good. There is the Problem of Evil, which posits 'how can a Good God allow Evil to exist? Either there is no God or God is Not-Good.' Then there are the actions of Bible God himself, which - by the standards of modern society - are a bit lacking in the morality department.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">There was the time God killed a man for an honest mistake:</p><blockquote class="_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">1 Corinthians 13</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">9</strong> When they came to the threshing floor of Kidon, Uzzah reached out his hand to steady the ark, because the oxen stumbled.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">10</strong> The Lord’s anger burned against Uzzah, and he struck him down because he had put his hand on the ark. So he died there before God.</p></blockquote><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Having a temper tantrum and killing a guy because he touched your special box while trying to keep it from tumbling does fall outside most people's definition of 'Good'.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">There was the time Moses got angry with his officers because he was unsatisfied with the amount of genocide his army had committed and wanted <strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">MORE</strong> genocide :</p><blockquote class="_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Numbers 31</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">6</strong> And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand of every tribe, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the holy instruments, and the trumpets to blow in his hand.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">7</strong> And they warred against the Midianites, as the Lord commanded Moses; and they slew all the males.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">8</strong> And they slew the kings of Midian, beside the rest of them that were slain; namely, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">9</strong> And the children of Israel took all the women of Midian captives, and their <strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">little ones</strong>, and took the spoil of all their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">10</strong> And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt, and all their goodly castles, with fire.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">11</strong> And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of men and of beasts.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">12</strong> And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, unto Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and unto the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by Jordan near Jericho.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">13</strong> And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the congregation, went forth to meet them without the camp.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">14</strong> And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, with the captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, which came from the battle.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">15</strong> And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive?</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">16</strong> Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the Lord in the matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation of the Lord.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">17</strong> Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">18</strong> But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.</p></blockquote><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Why did the soldiers kill all the boy children but keep the little girl children alive 'for themselves'?

And the point of this thread is - don't bother. Because it doesn't really matter if God isn't Good. It doesn't really matter if God is Evil.
