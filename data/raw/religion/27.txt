The only thing outside the realm of science is that which is subjective. So fair play: the subjective might be outside naturalism. Science cannot tell us if we watched a "good game". You and I may watch the same game and decide it was good or bad and we can both be right even if we have opposing opinions. Science is of no use here.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Second, for anything objectively true... anything that is true for everyone everywhere at the same time... that is within the realm of science, reason, and naturalism. For example, if we wanted to ask "Did a game take place?" We could use science, reason, and naturalism to find an answer.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Third, a limitation of technology does not put an objective thing outside the realm of science. For example, we can all agree that we can use science to know where the moon will be at any given date. We can use telescopes, mathematics, and other techniques to know this. If we ask, "Where will the moon be in 100 years from this moment" it's a matter of science. If we had never invented telescopes it would still be a matter of science. Because it's an objective phenomenon.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Fourth, any truth claim about reality that's objective falls under the realm of science. This includes religious miracles. They either happened or they didn't. It's a fact or a falsehood. Jesus either walked on water or he didn't. It's impossible for him to have walked on water for me AND to have (somehow) not walked on water for you. If there were any science that supported it, you can bet that Christians would absolutely be screaming their heads off about it to anyone who would listen.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The conclusion we come to is to see so-called "supernatural claims" for what they are: failed scientific hypotheses that are so resoundingly nonsensical that their chance of being true is best described as "so low to be as good as false". Most theists have been taught (often from the time they can speak) that claims about their own religion either don't require evidence ("Faith!") or operate under a different set of bad logical rules ("Because GOD that's why"). When disarmed of this illogic and forced to use the same consistent logic everyone else uses (And the same logic theists themselves use for phenomenon outside their religion) the truth becomes clear.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">"Jesus walked on water" is a scientific claim and it's one we have no reason to believe. We know water can't be walked upon and the only so-called "evidence" theists have is to just heap on more and more unsupported claims and special pleadings. It's like this for every miracle/supernatural claim.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">EDIT:</strong> So I've made similar arguments before and something that always pops up is "could there be evidence for [miraculous thing]? It's possible!"</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And?</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">We can take ANY unlikely, false, or impossible claim and falsely make it sound more plausible by insisting that some unknown bit of evidence COULD be out there. "This sentence has no letters in it." Does it become any more reasonable if we say "well there COULD be evidence there's no letters in the previous sentence!" We haven't gotten any closer to proving the claim. No evidence has been provided. There's still a ton of letters in the sentence. Actual evidence and the possibility of evidence are not interchangeable.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Theists will invoke this to try to lend credibility to unsupported nonsense claims. As though this little smoke and mirrors can (somehow) stand in for evidence. It can't. It's disingenuous. Just an attempt to move the goal posts.</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  "  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  "  >  T  h  e  r  e     i  s     n  o     s  u  c  h     t  h  i  n  g     a  s     a     "  s  u  p  e  r  n  a  t  u  r  a  l     c  l  a  i  m  "     a  n  d     n  o  t  h  i  n  g     o  u  t  s  i  d  e     n  a  t  u  r  a  l  i  s  m  .  <  /  h  1  >
