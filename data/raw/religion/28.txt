I will list them out below for clarity.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Things that are okay according to Muhammad, but not okay according to modern Western values: marrying a child or anyone more than 30 years younger than you (since ofc there will be Muslims here citing the unbacked sources of Aisha being 17, as if that's perfectly okay by modern western values when Muhammad was minimum 50 at the time), killing people for leaving Islam, not allowing people to be involved with politics/ decision making if they are not Muslim, having multiple wives (but not multiple husbands), having slaves.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The Quran doesn't have a time limit. It doesn't say "after 500 years, use the modern cultural values". It doesn't say "if Muhammad and your culture don't align, then make sure to use your own culture, because Muhammad may have lived a long time ago". Instead, it says "Muhammad is the FINAL prophet, and his message is the FINAL message of God."</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">If you choose western values over Muhammad's message, you are not a Muslim. Only the extremists are real Muslims, because only they truly follow the shahada. Reject Muhammad as Prophet = not a Muslim, by any definition of the word.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Also, notice that none of this is addressing what is actually right in an objective sense. The moral relativist trolls can hold their horses. I am not saying if it is good or bad to be Muslim or not, just that Islam is fundamentally incompatible with modern western values, and if you are prioritizing modern western values over Muhammad, then you cannot be a Muslim. Whether that is good or bad, or if the western values are wrong, is up to you.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">[As an aside, the Persians and Byzantines that were Muhammad's contemporaries punished pedophiles. Pedophilia being gross is not new. Saying pedophilia was okay 1300 years ago because Muhammad did it is like saying slavery is okay today because Qatar is doing it. Islam had outdate morals from its very inception, but that's not directly relevant to my main thesis. I just felt like I had to include it.]</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  "  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  "  >  Y  o  u     c  a  n  n  o  t     b  e     a     M  u  s  l  i  m     i  f     y  o  u     s  a  y     t  h  a  t     i  t     i  s     u  n  f  a  i  r     t  o     j  u  d  g  e     M  o  h  a  m  m  e  d     b  y     m  o  d  e  r  n     s  t  a  n  d  a  r  d  s  <  /  h  1  >
