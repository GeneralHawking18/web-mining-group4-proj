Messianic institutions advocate for Trinitarianism. Trinitarianism is a Christian invention not supported by Jewish tradition or the Tanakh. The Christian ideas of the Incarnation and hypostatic union are similarly not supported by Judaism. Judaism teaches that God is one and not a man. Judaism also teaches that the messiah will be a man, not an incarnation of God. Worshipping a man or the Trinity is considered idolatry (avodah zarah) in Judaism. Messianic acceptance of these doctrines places them outside the acceptable boundaries of Judaism. Messianic appeals to the Tanakh on these points are irrelevant, which is explained in the next section.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Scripturally</strong>: Christian, not Jewish. In addition to accepting the Christian "new testament," Messianics also adhere to the Protestant doctrine of Sola Scriptura: the idea that the Christian Bible is the sole and infallible source of authority for faith and practice. There are problems with both of these facts. First, the new testament is fundamentally opposed to Judaism and deeply antisemitic. For example, it teaches that the Torah is a curse, advocates disregard for Torah observance, and refers to Jews as children of the devil (and much more). No movement that accepts the new testament can be considered legitimately Jewish for these reasons.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">More importantly, the reliance on Sola Scriptura demonstrates the Protestant nature of this movement. Neither Judaism nor Catholicism accept this idea, instead understanding that scripture is in need of interpretation through a legitimate chain of authority. For a Christian example of the need for interpretation, take the theology of communion. At the Last Supper, Jesus states "This is my body... This is my blood" in reference to the bread and wine. Catholics claim this somewhat literally and hold the theology of transubstantiation, i.e. that they are truly his body and blood at the Mass, while most Protestants take a more symbolic approach. The text is not clear one way or the other which theory is correct, and therefore needs an authoritative interpretation, which is provided by the churches. The same principle holds true for Judaism and the interpretation of the Torah.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Sola scriptura was a major innovation of the Protestant Revolution and is an entirely Christian idea. (In point of fact, sola scriptura is self-contradictory because Christian scriptures don't teach it. It is therefore a doctrine dependent on the authority of the church rather than scripture and ironically constitutes a Protestant version of an oral interpretive tradition.) In Judaism, the chain of authority is traced from the rabbis to Moses at Sinai and is referred to as the Oral Torah. The Oral Torah became the Mishnah and with its commentary the Gemarah is known as the Talmud. There is no Judaism without the Talmud. Messianics overwhelmingly reject the authority of the Talmud, halakha, and rabbis generally. Jewish interpretive tradition (Talmud and rabbis) is therefore replaced with the Protestant interpretive tradition (Christian-Bible-Alone Theory). Messianic appeals to Christian interpretations of the Tanakh are therefore irrelevant for the support of their theological claims as a form of Judaism.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Ritually</strong>: Christian, not Jewish, but deceptively made to look Jewish. Jewish rituals and ritual items are symbolic expressions of the teachings of Judaism. Because Judaism and Christianity are theologically mutually exclusive, the meanings of these rituals and items must be altered by Messianics to express Christian doctrines. A prime example is the Passover Seder, which Messianics change to make about Jesus's last supper, death, and resurrection rather than the Exodus. In changing the meanings (and often the forms/practice) of these rituals and items, Messianics both disrespect and degrade them. Therefore, when Christians copy Jewish rituals or use ritual items, they become essentially non-Jewish because they have been ripped from their original context and altered.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">It is also hypocritical of Messianics to adopt Jewish rituals and ritual items. Most of these things were either created or given form by the rabbis of the Talmud after the fall of the Temple, which of course happened after Jesus died. For example, the Passover Seder in its current form did not exist in the time of Jesus. Using these rituals and items that are based on rabbinic interpretation while selectively rejecting the authority of the rabbis on other things, e.g. theology, is hypocritical. If they were consistent, they would rely on the teachings of the Bible alone, which would lead to some interesting, and probably laughable, results. However, the reason they do as they do is not because of a desire for consistent theology, but because of their mission to convert Jews. They know if they stray too far from the illusion of standard Jewish ritual, their form of Christianity would not appeal to Jews in the slightest. So, they adopt these rituals for the sake of proselytizing alone and making it appear as though one can convert to Christianity while maintaining a connection to Judaism.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Sociologically</strong>: Christian, not Jewish. Many, if not most, members of Messianic churches are gentiles who never converted to Judaism. Of those few members who are ethnically Jewish (either totally or through one parent), they have ceased to practice Judaism, if they did to begin with, because of their conversion to Christianity. According to Jewish law, they are no longer part of the Jewish community and are treated as gentiles with regard to any religious issue. Food they prepare is not considered kosher, for example, and they cannot lead prayer in a synagogue, receive an aliyah, or even be counted in a minyan. They are effectively non-Jewish unless and until they repent and renounce Christianity. The only privilege they retain from their Jewish identity is that they are not required to undergo a conversion upon their return.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Messianics will often argue that this treatment is hypocritical because Jewish Buddhists and atheists, for example, are not treated the same way. Technically speaking, the same restrictions should apply in these situations, however, if the community is more lenient in these cases, it is for two specific reasons. 1) Jewish Buddhists and atheists are not trying to convert Jews away from Judaism, and 2) they are not trying to dishonestly portray Buddhism or atheism as a "fulfilled," "completed," or "more authentic" form of Judaism. Furthermore, interest in and adoption of these worldviews are organic phenomena in the Jewish community, whereas Messianics are an intrusive, predatory, outside proselytizing phenomenon created by gentiles.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Messianics will also sometimes claim that if Judaism is a civilization or culture, as taught by Mordecai Kaplan, then their appropriation should be seen as legitimate. This is a misunderstanding of Kaplan. The transvaluation of sancta in Kaplan's theory must be based in the values and traditions of the Jewish community. Kaplan's understanding of God, for example, was a new theological position, but it was fundamentally grounded in the Jewish concept of God. Messianics, however, hold to evangelical theology in toto. It is not rooted in Judaism or Jewish culture, but is an entirely gentile Protestant creation. It therefore is not an example of the organic evolution of Jewish civilization, but is very obviously an imposition and attempt to convert Jews away from Judaism.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The claim that Christianity began as a Jewish sect is irrelevant to this issue. Christianity became a gentile religion almost immediately after the death of Jesus. By the time of Paul's letters, 20-30 years after Jesus, Christianity was overwhelmingly majority gentile. Christian theology regarding the Trinity and incarnation was a gentile creation, and much of their scriptures (e.g. the gospels and many of the epistles) were obviously written by gentiles unfamiliar with and/or hostile to Judaism. Christianity spent it's most formative first centuries defining itself against Judaism, and it's most influential theologians were not Jews (e.g. Augustine, Origen, Tertullian, etc). Christianity's development over the last two thousand years has been almost entirely in a gentile context, including the Protestant Revolution, which is the most important development for Messianics since their theology is entirely Evangelical Protestant in nature. Christianity is a gentile, not a Jewish creation, and therefore cannot be considered part of Kaplan's theory of Jewish civilization.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">In Sum</strong>: Messianics are Christians, not Jews in any relevant sense, and their religion is not Judaism. Theologically and scripturally, they are entirely Evangelical. Ritually, despite their appropriation of Jewish ceremonies and ritual items, they are Christian because of their alterations and reasons for doing them. Sociologically, they are mostly gentile Christians, and those who are ethnically Jewish have effectively become non-Jewish according to Jewish law because of their embrace of Christianity. Furthermore, because they are a Christian proselytizing creation, they are not a legitimate outgrowth of Jewish civilization, à la Kaplan, and therefore are not given the same leniency as Jewish apostates.</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  "  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  "  >  T  h  e     M  e  s  s  i  a  n  i  c     P  h  e  n  o  m  e  n  o  n     i  s     E  n  t  i  r  e  l  y     C  h  r  i  s  t  i  a  n     a  n  d     I  s     N  o  t     a     F  o  r  m     o  f     J  u  d  a  i  s  m  .  <  /  h  1  >
