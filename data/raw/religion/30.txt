And Constantine was fully aware of his act of spreading the culture of an oppressed minority without giving much in return to them.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Now, I'm not promoting the cultish abuses of Scientology, but could we at least encourage the somewhat independent and culturally regional development of a religious movement? I say this, considering that aliens and UFOs are a staple of American culture, even if British culture and others influenced early science fiction.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Naturally, I'm aware that my arguments fail if one considers the theological claims of Christianity to be true. Of course, a Christian would consider the spreading of Christianity as the higher good. But could we leave that aside for a second and say something substantial about the cultural factors surrounding the development of religions, so that we can encourage new beliefs to be only theologically wrong instead of being both theologically <em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE">and</em> culturally wrong?</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  "  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  "  >  C  h  r  i  s  t  i  a  n  i  t  y     d  i  d     c  u  l  t  u  r  a  l     a  p  p  r  o  p  r  i  a  t  i  o  n  .
