My argument is as follows:</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">P1: god exists with omnipotence</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">P2: god has no deficiencies, shortcomings or inadequacies, in other words god 'needs' nothing</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">P3: desire ultimately stems from deficiencies, shortcomings or inadequacies</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">P4: the creation of humans cannot fulfil any need or satisfy any desire that god has</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">C: god created human beings with ultimately no purpose</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I feel that I must elaborate on the 2nd and 3rd premise as it the most dubious. P2 god has no deficiencies is derived from the fact that an infinite being could theoretically have anything, so a specific desire can't possibly have a purpose. For example, if someone theoretically had an infinite amount of money to spend, they cannot possibly desire more money, fundamentally they "could" but why? There would ultimately be no purpose of having more money if you already have an infinite amount to spend. P3 just means that the reason for desire is really just from a lack of things. An example of this is, the desire for food. Why would someone want food? Because of their caloric requirements and their deficiency of requiring food for nutrients. This analogy is hard to relate to god, but you get the point.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I would like to formally thank anyone who read this far, and for taking the time to respond to my arguments. I'll do my best to respond to the counterarguments.</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  "  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  "  >  g  o  d     c  a  n  n  o  t     b  e     i  n  v  o  k  e  d     t  o     a  n  s  w  e  r     t  h  e     m  e  a  n  i  n  g     o  f     l  i  f  e  <  /  h  1  >
