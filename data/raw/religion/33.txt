For clarity's sake</p><ol class="_1eJr7K139jnMstd4HajqYP"><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The suffering in the world is caused by human free will</p></li><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">it is vitally important to preserve human free will.</p></li><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Ergo, a benevolent god would allow some suffering</p></li></ol><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Yes, I'm aware this is very simplified, but as I said, most of you know it. I'll be addressing two counterarguments I've not seen before.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">As a quick clarification, I am here assuming that God is a being that can be judged morally (and is judged as a good being) If he <em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE">isn't</em>- if god could make literally the opposite decision in every choice he's ever had and be morally identical- then I have to concede defeat. An amoral god doesn't need defending, but as such a being couldn't be omnibenevolent by simple logic, it's a mutual loss.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">By the same token, if the argument is that God is not a <em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE">being</em> then again, I concede that what is essentially the operating system of the universe has no obligation to end suffering. However, I would also question under what grounds a mindless being entity doesn't do or think anything constitutes a "God" in any meaningful sense.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Now, assuming we have a god that is a moral agent (that is, he intentionally acts and his actions can be moral or immoral), three arguments  that an omnibenevolent being couldn't create a world with suffering even granting all acts of evil are caused by humans.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">The Argument From Shared Guilt</strong></p><ol class="_1eJr7K139jnMstd4HajqYP"><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">God has extreme influence over our actions (even if we grant free will)</p></li><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">If a being you have extreme influence over the actions of commits an immoral act, you share (at least partially) their guilt</p></li><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Humans commit immoral acts</p></li><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Therefore, god is not all-good (as he shares guilt in a number of immoral acts)</p></li></ol><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">God obviously has a huge amount of control over our actions- he created us, he created our brain chemistry, he created our environments, he created everything. He has a strong- maybe total- amount of influence over what we chose. Now, maybe you're a compatiablist and think that doesn't affect free will. I actually agree! But, even granting that the wicked among us do evil things of their own free will, god's influence makes him culpable too.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Let's take a mass shooter. The mass shooter is responsible for his evil acts, obviously. But most mass shooters are incels, so what about those people who promoted that ideology to him? What of demagogues who talked to him about how all women are whores and deserved violent revenge, what of the forum-goers who egged him on? Most would agree that they share the guilt, to some extent.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">As influence gets stronger, so too does shared guilt. For example, we generally consider Hitler completely responsible for all the evil acts of Nazi Germany. It all acted under his orders, in a system he designed, so he holds the blame for the actions of those actors (who, again, are still morally culpable for their part). Note this even includes the actions he was not directly responsble- there were plenty of people killed by the Nazis without any orders from above, but Hitler's control over Germany was such he can still be held responsible. But even the most oppressive tyrant has only a fraction of the control over their minions that God has over us.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">With his extreme control over what we choose, God holds significant moral blame for the actions of evil people <em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE">regardless</em> of whether the evil people do too*.* At best, the Moral Argument shows that humanity and God share equal blame for the state of the world. But of course, we're not claiming to be all good. God is.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">As any evil acts humans do god shares at the very least a significant amount of responsibility for, this world is a moral indictment upon its creator. Ergo, an tri-omni god doesn't exist.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">The Argument From Immoral Bystanders</strong></p><ol class="_1eJr7K139jnMstd4HajqYP"><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">If you have the power to stop an act of evil and don't, you have done an immoral thing</p></li><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">God has the power to stop acts of evil and doesn't.</p></li><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Ergo, an all-good god can't exist</p></li></ol><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This is simple. Let us suppose I see a child being beaten to death. Now, this is not my fault. I'm not responsible for the child's attack in any way, I have no blame here. This brutal murder is entirely outside of my responsibility. But surely, even granting this, is it not still immoral for me to sit back and watch?</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Even granting that God is not responsible for the acts of evil in the world, this doesn't discharge the responsibility to <em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE">do</em> something about them. Even if we have pure, libertarian free will and say the mass shooter acted purely uncausedly? Even if we grant a form of omniscience where God didn't know the mass shooter would act until they started shooting? This doesn't change the fact there is still an obligation to stop the mass shooter. You are not only obligated to stop evil you personally caused.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">As the universe has a huge amount of suffering that God could stop but doesn't, there is still a moral implausibility here. Even if God is not responsible for the creation of evil we can still raise the question as to why he didn't destroy it once it came into being, bringing the problem of suffering back into focus.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">The Argument From Robotics</strong></p><ol class="_1eJr7K139jnMstd4HajqYP"><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The Free Will defense depends on a being having free will being an overwhelming good.</p></li><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">However, we have good reason to think that granting a being free will can be evil.</p></li><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Ergo, the free will defense doesn't work.</p></li></ol><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I kind of want to just quote Unravelled here- "What kind of sicko creates a sapient crash test dummy?" But I'll expand.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Lets take a bomb disposal robot. Admittedly, we can't make a sentient bomb disposal robot. But suppose we could. AI was advanced enough we could make robots that were as capable of feeling fear and pain as humans. Would it be moral to make the bomb disposal robot sapient?</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Well- no, right? You're creating a mind purely to put it in continuous situations of mortal terror. To give a being a genuine mind rather then a robotic algorithm in a situation where a sapient mind would be undergoing extreme distress is wrong. You can come up with other examples- Sapient video game enemies, say, or the aforementioned sapient crash test dummies. Even if possible, there are situations where its unethical to create a sapient free willed being over a mindless automaton.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Is existence one of those cases?</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Well- lots of it are. Lots of people do experience extreme terror, despair and pain for most or all of those life. Surely, the same standard by which the sapient crash test dummy is monstrous applies here- for such people, you should create a robot. Creating a mind directly into a situation where it will experience extreme suffering is wrong- it is more ethical to make a mindless robot.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">If nothing else, it seems there is no reason for <em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE">animal</em> life to be more then automata in a world so allegedly anthropocentric. Yet, as far as we can tell animals have fully functional minds.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">But in this case, free will is not a counter to the problem of suffering. It is possible for granting a being free will to be an act of evil in and of itself, and it seems like a lot of cases of free willed entities we see are such cases.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Ergo, our world is still a world its immoral to make, and thus an omnibenevolent being doesn't exist</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">TL;DR</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Even granting free will, god still holds moral responsibility for the acts of humans, still holds moral responsibility for not stopping the results of human free will, and still holds moral responsibility for the act of creating conscious self-willed life at all. As these are serious moral charges, free will doesn't resolve the problem of suffering.</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  "  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  "  >  F  r  e  e     W  i  l  l     i  s     n  o  t     a     v  a  l  i  d     d  e  f  e  n  s  e     o  f     a  n     O  m  n  i  b  e  n  e  v  o  l  e  n  t     G  o  d  :     a  r  g  u  m  e  n  t  s     f  r  o  m     s  h  a  r  e  d     g  u  i  l  t  ,     t  h  e     i  m  m  o  r  a  l  i  t  y     o  f     b  y  s  t  a  n  d  e  r  s     a  n  d     r  o  b  o  t  i  c  s  .  <  /  h  1  >
