Their very minds are deceitful. Their ways and thoughts are different to God, and unless illuminated by the Spirit they cannot discern spiritual things.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Yet Paul claims men have no excuse for not believing in God - specifically, the God of Israel - because he claims our intuition naturally points to God.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">So which is it - do we trust our intuition or not? Do our hearts naturally perceive reality or don't they? Are our minds instinctively oriented to truth or deception?</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">It seems that when it comes to human instincts, the Bible wants to have its cake and eat it too. when our instincts point toward concepts that support the Bible, we can trust them. When they don't, we can't. That's a terrible argument that can be used to support anything.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">"You know UFOs are real because <em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">you instinctively feel</strong></em> there must be intelligent life out there / you know UFOs are false because <em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">you instinctively feel</strong></em> humans can trick themselves into seeing things in the sky that aren't real."</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  "  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  "  >  B  e  c  a  u  s  e     t  h  e     B  i  b  l  e     m  a  k  e  s     i  t     c  l  e  a  r     t  h  e     h  u  m  a  n     h  e  a  r  t     i  s     n  a  t  u  r  a  l  l  y     d  e  c  e  i  t  f  u  l  ,     P  a  u  l  '  s     R  o  m  a  n  s     1     a  r  g  u  m  e  n  t     t  h  a  t     m  e  n     i  n  h  e  r  e  n  t  l  y     p  e  r  c  e  i  v  e     G  o  d  '  s     e  x  i  s  t  e  n  c  e     h  o  l  d  s     n  o     w  e  i  g  h  t  <  /  h  1  >
