It has been quite some time since my <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/t60psu/refuting_two_novel_arguments_by_apologetics/" class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">last post</a> on here. Today, I briefly return with some reflections on a few relatively recent theodicies, I've come across that I think are difficult to respond to. What is a theodicy? To understand this, we will first need an understanding of the problem of evil.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The problem of evil is an argument for the non-existence of God which starts with some facts or observations, of evil, or suffering we see in the world. Be it the occurrence of evil and suffering generally, or more concrete horrific examples of evil or suffering such as a Fawn burning to death in a forest fire. There is taken to be two kinds of problem of evil. An <a href="https://iep.utm.edu/evil-evi/" class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">evidential</a>, and a <a href="https://iep.utm.edu/evil-log/" class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">logical</a> version. A logical problem of evil, argues that theism and the occurrence of evil are jointly inconsistent. The basic form of such an argument would be as follows.</p><ol class="_1eJr7K139jnMstd4HajqYP"><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">If evil exists, then it's not the case that God exists</p></li><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Evil exists</p></li><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Therefore it's not the case that God exists</p></li></ol><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">An evidential problem of evil on the other hand, argues that the occurrence of the evil we see (Usually, in particular, horrendous, seemingly gratuitous suffering) is highly unlikely on theism. That is, that given the truth of theism, antecedently, it would be very surprising if it turned out there were evils of the sort we observe in this world. There are many ways to formulate such an argument that atheist philosophers have come up with, there are inductive formulations, intuition-based formulations, Bayesian formulations etc. Here is a basic evidential argument from evil.</p><ol class="_1eJr7K139jnMstd4HajqYP"><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">If God exists, then gratuitous evil does not exist</p></li><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Probably, gratuitous evil exists</p></li><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Therefore, probably, God does not exist</p></li></ol><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Gratuitous evil being evil with no morally justifying reason for it's existence.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">There are two ways theists tend to respond to the problem of evil. One would be a defense, another would be a theodicy. A defense is a response to a logical problem of evil, it is a story one can tell, which, when conjoined with theism, makes theism and the existence of evil compossible. The most famous example is Alvin Plantinga's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Plantinga%27s_free-will_defense" class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">free will defense</a>. It's important to note that, a defense, does not need to be remotely likely, or plausible, it only needs to be true for all one knows and not entail a logical contradiction.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">A theodicy, on the other hand, is a response to the evidential problem of evil. It is a story which is taken to be both plausible given the truth of theism, and when added to theism, makes the occurrence of the evils we see unsurprising from a probabilistic standpoint. Unlike a defense, a theodicy must be a story which is plausibly actually true, not just true for all one knows. To be a successful theodicy, much more is needed then mere logical coherence since what needs to be shown is not merely that theism is consistent with evil, but that there is no significant evidential tension between theism and observations of evil. A standard example of a theodicy is John Hick's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irenaean_theodicy" class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">soul-making theodicy</a>. We will not be discussing the soul-making theodicy today. Instead, I will be addressing more obscure, non-traditional theodicies, that have been discussed on the philosophically sophisticated theist side of YouTube. It is to this, that I now turn.</p><div class="_7T4UafM1PdBGycd5na9nF">The Non-Identity Theodicy</div><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The first theodicy I will examine is the non-identity theodicy. Before reading this section, I highly recommend watching Apologetic Squared's short <a href="https://youtu.be/j1xU3eAq4p0" class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">7 minute video</a> on this theodicy or reading the <a href="https://philpapers.org/archive/VITNT.pdf" class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">original paper</a> on it. I will just give a brief sketch of it.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The basic idea is this; what makes me, me, and you, you, is our essential properties. And, the story goes, our essential properties include (and are possibly exhausted by) facts about our origins, indeed very specific facts about our origins, including the total causal history which has resulted in ones coming-to-be, our ancestral history, and evolutionary history. But this history includes a lot of suffering. So, God permits this suffering to bring about you, and me, that is you and me in particular. If God did not allow such suffering, then you wouldn't exist, rather someone else would, with some other set of essential properties. God's intention is to bring about us in particular, you, me, Jim and Bob across the street, etc. He views bringing about us in particular, as a valuable end in itself, such that the means he uses to achieve such an end, which includes vast amounts of horrific suffering, makes it all worthwhile!  We will now turn our attention to the objections.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Objection 1.</strong></em></p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The non-identity theodicy requires the truth of origin essentialism. This seems reasonably plausible on it's own. It seems like, at least partly, what would make me numerically distinct from an identical clone of myself would be my origins. Perhaps my clone was created in a test-tube using my DNA, whereas I was created through regular human reproduction etc. So my origins are an essential property of me, if those weren't my origins, I wouldn't be me. The problem is, the theodicy is more radical, it requires that the entire causal history prior to my coming-to-be, including facts about suffering that do not seem to have any relevant causal connection to my origins, are essential to me. This strikes me as unintuitive in the extreme. While an object like you are me, could not have a entirely different origin, it seems like we could have a slightly different origin. That is, it seems like some degree of modal tolerance is permissable. Suppose I didn't believe my great grandfather fought in the first world war, but then my father tells me he did. It doesn't seem, in the slightest, that I'm learning about who I am, that is, learning about my essential characteristics. Or that, if it later turned out my grandfather did not fight in WW1, I would be finding out that I'm a different person than I previously thought I was, that seems utterly bizarre. On the other hand, if I found out that I am a brain in a vat, or a clone created in a test-tube, it seems like I would indeed be shocked to find out that I am not who I thought I was! But then, if not every fact about our origins is essential, what facts are and aren't? On reflection, one answer with some plausibility, is the essential part of my origin is the event of my father's sperm fertilizing my mother's egg, and the set of pre-natal embryonic states which followed etc. That is, what is relevent to an object or persons origins, is the causal history of the material out of which it was originally constituted. What makes the desk on which I am typing, *this* desk, is the history of the wood and nails which constitutes it. A view such as this is often used in tandum with Kripke's causal theory of reference. For a technical paper on this see <a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/SALHNT" class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">But suppose we even grant (as I would not) that every state of affairs which forms part of the causal chain ultimately leading to my birth, stretching back even to specific facts related to our evolutionary history, are an essential part of my origins as the argument needs. There is now a further question. Why then, couldn't the events which feature creaturely suffering, have radically different psychophysical connections? Were there a God, He could have easily set it up so that basically all the physical events in the causal chain leading up to my and your creation are the same as they are in this world, but the sensations of pain experienced internally by the creatures and persons were not horrifically agonizing, or at least greatly less so. So your origin and my origin is surely the same or same enough, our existence/essential properties would be preserved. Yet, the extremely undesirable experiences felt by persons and sentient non-persons leading up to us, would be greatly diminished. Surely God could have, indeed, would have, actualized that world, and as far as this theodicy goes, it appears to be left a mystery as to why He did not.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The theodicist might conceivably respond, that actually if God were to change the psychophysical laws, He would have to change the physical events, since those phenomenal states, necessarily supervene on those physical states. But, for one this is highly implausible on the theists own view, since presumably God has phenomenal states prior to the creation of any physical states, and for those who maintain an afterlife, humans as well can have phenomenal states despite no longer having a physical body. So, it would seem phenomenal content does not necessarily depend on certain physical states, you can have different phenomenal contents despite changes in physical states. Further, it seems like, in principle, an omnipotent God should be understood as having complete control over the causal laws factive to His creation. Finally, even if a change in the specific phenomenal contents like pain, entails a change in physical states, it seems like only minor changes, utterly irrelevant to our material origins are required. The theist would need to motivate the prima facie implausible claim that changes relevant to our material origins are required, that isn't just an ad hoc move to save the theodicy.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Scott Hill has a <a href="https://kevinvallier.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hill_Non-Identity-Theodicy.pdf" class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">paper</a> on the non-identity theodicy, where he attempts to motivate a radical origin essentialism. I will address this in turn.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Scott characterizes the origin essentialism he accepts as follows.</p><blockquote class="_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">"Assembly Origin Essentialism: If the materials from which a creature originated were assembled by a process that was too different, then that creature would not have existed."</p></blockquote><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">At first blush, there doesn't seem to be an issue. But, it is left ambiguous what is precisely meant by "too different". Scott and I, are going to disagree on the threshold. Be that as it is, Scott gives 3 justifications for why an Assembly Origin Essentialism should be strong enough to motivate the non-identity theodicy.</p><blockquote class="_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">"My first argument is that intervening in the world in the ways described in Waiting and Painless Evolution constitutes changes that are too big. At most a proponent of Assembly Origin Essentialism should allow a few minor changes to the process by which the materials  from which I arose are assembled such as the one in Forbes' example. On the other hand,  the miracles required in Waiting and Painless Evolution require big changes to the process. So my origin is not preserved in such cases."</p></blockquote><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">What Scott seems to be imagining here is God constantly making significant interventions, and performing miracles. This, however, is not a requirement. As discussed above, God does not have to make significant interventions, indeed, it doesn't seem like God has to intervene at all, He could have set it up so, prior to the initiation of the given causal chain, the events in the causal chain qua creaturely suffering, are linked up with less horrifically painful phenomenal states, or there are different psychophysical laws of nature. Otherwise, God could make small adjustments, so that the history of the materials leading to me, or you, are the same or similar enough, but there isn't such a frequency, intensity, and distribution, of horrific suffering among persons and non-persons. Afterall, it doesn't seem like a T-Rex mauling a Brochosaurus alive, or even my mother's pre-birth agony, is absolutely necessary for me, or Bob's, or anybody elses origins. The material out of which we originated could have an identical, or, intuitively, an identical enough history, such that I am still me and you are still you, sans such horrors. But even if we grant that God needs to make really major changes or interventions, it just needs to be logically actualizable that, in light of such major changes which are minimally sufficient to prevent horrific suffering, the history of our material origins could still be similar enough so that we would still exist. This seems logically possible, and since it seems logically possible, it seems like a state of affairs which God can actualize. So there are further burden-shifting grounds to reject Scott's claim.</p><blockquote class="_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">"My second argument is that accepting such a strong variant of origin essentialism yields a gain in explanatory power... adopting a version of origin essentialism that rules out Waiting and Painless Evolution forms part of a theodicy that explains why God allows evil. That is a significant gain in explanatory power for the theist."</p></blockquote><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I just have a couple points here. For one, it's debatable whether the non-identity theodicy does have such explanatory power, I've already offered a couple reasons to think it does not, and I will provide more reasons. For two, even if adopting such a view does explain the occurrence of evils under the truth of theism, as a non-theist, I do not grant that this is a gain in explanatory power tout court.</p><blockquote class="_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">"My third argument is that adopting such a strong version of origin essentialism eliminates vagueness... There seems to be no principled way to say when an origin becomes so different that it fails to preserve the existence of an organism other than never or always. And if we are antecedently attracted to Assembly Origin Essentialism, it isn’t plausible to hold that a change in origin never yields a different organism. So we should say that any change at all in the process by which the materials of my origin were assembled yields a different mere duplicate of me rather than me."</p></blockquote><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This argument has more bite than the other two, but I think it is defeasible. I agree that if you hold that any change whatsoever in the causal history of ones origins is a change in the essential properties of some object or organism then that does indeed eliminate vagueness and arbitrariness, and, prima facie, this does seem to be a problem for views which are restrictive. But, so too would positing that having any strands of hair, constitutes non-baldness, or positing that any collection of 2 or more grains of sand constitutes a pile. We have an intuitive, conventional understanding of what a pile is, and what non-baldness is, and these views, while having the virtue of eliminating vagueness, simply do not track our concepts. This is analogous to radical origin essentialism, it simply doesn't track my, and I think our shared intuitive understanding of what makes us, us, and I take myself to have illustrated why this is so, above. If vagueness is a cost of maintaining such a view, then it's one I gladly pay, with the hopes that one day we do discover a restrictive criterion for essentiality of origins, which avoids issues of vague predicates.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Objection 2.</strong></em></p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Suppose we forgo the first objection, and agree that a very radical kind of origin essentialism is true. Even so, I believe the plausibility of the theodicy is parasitic upon a subtle sort of equivocation. It rests on the intuition that the existence of you, and you in particular, your mother and father, your best friends and the love of your life, and those people in the actual world who satisfy those descriptions in particular are valuable in themselves, for their own sake. But suppose I asked you what makes them valuable, or at least, why you value them so dearly. Plausibly, you'd list out the set of things they've done for you, the bad times they were there to help you get through, the virtues and other admirable qualities they embody, possibly some physical features if you know what I mean. Among other things in that ballpark. It would be very odd for you to list off a specific set of essential properties related to their origins like that a great ape was eaten alive by an alligator billions of years ago. In fact, if you were to do that, I'd probably try to contact a mental health clinician. What this tells me is, while it can be granted that there are essential properties related to my origins that make me, me, rather than someone else. These essential features are, in fact, accidental if we zoom out and ask what stands in the right sort of making-relation in terms of my value properties. If God, in creating, was aiming towards some highly specific set of essential characteristics and in doing so actualizing states of affairs that are technically necessary to make us who we are, rather than the second order goods that plausibly make us valuable, then it seems like God's intentions are not contrastively, aimed at the right sort of end.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">A proponent of the theodicy might be tempted to argue, that actually, there is nothing further that makes me valuable, it is irreducible. I'm not valuable in virtue of exemplifying certain goods, I'm just valuable as such. Even this, however, won't do. If the value is irreducible, then God could have actualized such irreducible value properties without actualizing my origins. What's needed, is that there are irreducible value properties which somehow necessarily supervene on states of affairs related to my origins. So what makes me valuable, is my essential properties qua my origins. This again, just doesn't appear plausible on reflection and would need to be motivated.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">But even if it is motivated, there is of course an issue of whether the value of contrastively actualizing me, rather than a qualitatively identical counterpart with a different origin that doesn't involve as much horrific suffering, is so great that it outweighs the aforementioned horrific suffering which was permitted. This, of course, is even more implausible. Granted, Vince Vitale, and Scott Hill, for this reason seem to grant that this theodicy doesn't do the work on it's own, but rather only when supplemented with the fact that creaturely evils will be defeated in an afterlife. More on this later.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Objection 3.</strong></em></p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The last objection I will present will be an undercutting one, from Kantian (or other deontological) duties. The theodicy seems to be motivated by a kind of deontology, wherein God is permitting creaturely suffering for the sake of creating me, and you, whom are ends in themselves, in the Kantian sense. In actuality though, this theodicy is the furthest thing from an endorsement of Kantian ethics, and is in fact radically consequentialist. What God is doing, according to the non-identity theodicy, is permitting the agonizing suffering, death, violation of autonomy and destruction of faculties, of billions of rational agents, and non-rational sentient agents, as a mere means to a heteronomous end. That is, he treats rational agents as a mere means to bring about other rational agents with certain essential traits, He fails to treat rational agents as ends in themselves. No contemporary Kantian in the known universe would find such actions tolerable, and Kant himself would most likely be rolling in his grave. As a related point, even  the vast majority of consequentialists would find the kind of normative framework this theodicy requires implausible in the extreme. It's not like God is maximizing pleasure, or happiness, or any metric of utility consequentialists would find plausible, rather he permits horrors just to bring about specific persons with specific essential characteristics.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">In light of these objections, while this theodicy is an interesting and unique piece of philosophy, I cannot find it plausible, as even a partial justification of the evil we see.</p><div class="_7T4UafM1PdBGycd5na9nF">The Participation Theodicy</div><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The next theodicy I will be examining is one created by a catholic self-proclaimed twitter apologist <a href="https://twitter.com/WriterJohnBuck" class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">John Buck</a>. Do not get the wrong impression though, he is not a pushover like his description implies and his participation theodicy is a clever one. Here is a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hed5q797KsNwC453V1qpK663Qkk7k9oG/view" class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">paper</a> he wrote on the theodicy, and here is a <a href="https://youtu.be/VjiseJXa2yQ" class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">recent discussion</a> he had on it with an atheist Youtuber.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">To briefly summarize, atheists will often present the problem of evil by arguing that God would create a perfect, one might say heavenly world, and we are not in such a world. The participation theodicy starts by granting that the best thing God can do is actualize an ideal world. But, it would be better for God, to use Alvin Plantinga's jargon, not to strongly actualize such a world, that is actualize it with His own power, from the get-go. But to weakly actualize it, by allowing that free creatures participate in the actualization of an ideal world. The catch being, for free creatures to participate in the creation of the ideal world, the world must start out non-ideal, indeed it might start out in the very notably far from ideal situation we find ourselves, with great amounts of creaturely suffering. But God is justified in permitting such suffering, because it is an all-things-considered good that an ideal world is brought about, by virtue of the creative participation of free agents, rather than an act of God's will alone.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Before we start with objections a few things are worth noting regarding the theodicy. The first is that it avoids a lot of the pitfalls of most other responses to the problem of evil, such as moral paralysis, the existence of apparently gratuitous evils, explanations for natural evils or animal suffering,  why a better state of affairs was not actualized etc. It is not without issues, but it is I think a quite impressive feature that it is able to sidestep many of the traditional problems that other theodicies run afoul of. The next is that, the theodicy has a lot in common with free will theodicies. While, it's admittedly better than any free will theodicy I've encountered, and doesn't suffer from some of the same issues, I think it does inherit some of it's follies. The last is, while it doesn't suffer from many of the same issues of other theodicies, it does suffer from a common issue that I call the issue of counterbalancing evils. The participation theodicy requires the intuition that God letting creatures actualize an ideal world is a greater good than God actualizing it Himself from the get-go, this intuition is not widely held. But even if you do share the intuition, it's surely not so strong that God's contrastively actualizing the world where creatures participate in the creation of the ideal world rather than God Himself creating the ideal world, is enough to outweigh the horrors we see. This is especially clear when we reflect on particularly horrific evils like a baby's being born with butterfly disease to live a short earthly life of nothing but pure agony. The intuition pump John uses, to motivate the theodicy, wrt a husband allowing his children to participate in making the wifes breakfast (See his <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hed5q797KsNwC453V1qpK663Qkk7k9oG/view" class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">paper</a> for more details) simply does not work for horrendous suffering. However, it may still be that the participation theodicy can be a partial justification and form part of a cumulative case against the problem of evil in conjunction with other partial justifications. My objections will attempt to undermine the participation theodicy as a partial justification.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Objection 1.</strong></em></p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The first objection I will present is I think probably the most common sense one, and one that Buck is familiar with. In order for the theodicy to be successful, it must be true, or at least plausible, that the actions of free creatures are tending toward the actualization of an ideal world. The problem being, this just doesn't seem to be plausible based on the evidence we have. In some ways, we have made substantive moral progress, technological progress, medical progress etc. but in many other ways things seem to be getting worse. Shootings in the US as of late are at an all-time high, global starvation is (almost) as bad as it's ever been, as is the horrors of factory farming and global predation, a certain party in the US is increasingly more deranged, we have the invasion of Ukraine, and the Isreali-Palestine conflict neither of which seem to be generally improving etc. We don't seem to be seeing a general trajectory towards an ideal state of affairs.</p><style class="mov-2-h" data-href="chunkCSS/UsersCountIndicator.2ab8dda40f822a31d31c_.css">._1W1pLIfaIb8rYU6YeTdAk6{margin-right:6px}._1H6Meh6ZAemKxOJDOEasfK{border-radius:50%;box-sizing:border-box;height:20px;margin-left:-8px;width:20px}._1H6Meh6ZAemKxOJDOEasfK:first-child{margin-left:0}._30vlMmCcnqKnXP1t-fzm0e{display:inline-block;margin-left:-8px;position:relative}

Even if we do somehow manage to solve every single issue on the planet, and create a harmonious utopia where we live blissful lives, which is already unlikely in the extreme, it seems to me. There are plausibly goods that are beyond the capacities of creatures like us, which only God could access. So, without aid, we will always fall short of an ideal world.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Lastly, these are just issues on our tiny little spec of a planet, there is also, of course, the possibility of horrific suffering (or other related horrors we can imagine, such as disasters on a galactic scale) on other solar systems in the trillions upon trillions of Galaxies which exist in our universe (possibly multiverse). Additionally, there is an expectation of the heat death of the universe. Which means not only are we on a time limit to create an ideal world, but once we do participate in this theater of growth, learning, and ultimately creation of an ideal world, all biological creatures, and everything else in God's physical creation will be destroyed, so what gives? That is, unless of course God chimes in to prevent it. In which case, it's hard to see what the principled difference would be between God's intervention to prevent the natural death of all, and God's intervention to prevent horrific suffering.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Buck responds to this concern in his paper.</p><blockquote class="_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">"The theodicy can grant that most creatures are incapable of significantly contributing towards the idealization of the world, but recall that the theodicy suggests we find ourselves in the midst of the process of idealization, not necessarily near its apex. For all we know there could be a billion more years before our world achieves idealization, well past the extinction of the human race. However, the very best things humans could be doing while we do exist would be to contribute what we can towards the eventual idealization of the world, even if that means simply doing what we can to prepare the next generation to be better at their responses to the hardships they will face."</p></blockquote><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This response, however, is unsatisfying. Recall in the introduction that the job of a theodicy, unlike a defense, is to tell a story that is plausible in order to remove the evidential tension evil creates for theism, not merely true for-all-one knows. I am happy to grant that the story John wants to endorse, that if not humans, some superior species or other will causally contribute to an ideal world possibly billions of years from now, is true for all we know. But, antecedently, it seems to me this story is no more probable than a set of mutually exclusive, jointly exhaustive and equally intrinsically simple stories I can tell which fail to include the actualization of an ideal world. Such as that humans will be the last intelligent species to exist, or that there will be other species that exist but they will all fail utterly at creating an ideal world, or that instead of realization of an ideal world the actions of free agents will ultimately create a hell world (that is the worst world possible) etc. If John does not give a reason to think his story is antecedently more probable than a set of incompatible stories like these, that is importantly, independent from the truth of the theistic hypothesis. Then the probabilities balance each other out, and we are then left with our initial judgement that, all other things equal, we do not seem to be tending towards an ideal world.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Objection 2.</strong></em></p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">As I said previously, this theodicy, I think runs afoul of some of the same issues as the free will defense. This theodicy relies on a distinction between God actualizing an ideal world, and free creatures being placed in a set of circumstances and participating in the actualizing of an ideal world. In other words, a distinction between God's strong actualization of an ideal world, and weak actualization of an ideal world. I think there are reasons to think the distinction collapses in this case, however.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Following the late and brilliant atheist philosopher <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Miracle-Theism-Arguments-against-Existence/dp/019824682X" class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">J.L. Mackie</a>. It would seem omniscience in conjunction with omnipotence jointly entails, or at least strongly implies, omnifiscence. That is, God is responsible for the strong actualization of every event, including the actions of His created free creatures. Here is an argument for that.</p><ol class="_1eJr7K139jnMstd4HajqYP"><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">If God is omnipotent, then all events are maximally within His power.</p></li><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">If God is omniscient, then all events are maximally within His awareness.</p></li><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">If all events are maximally within God's awareness and power, then God is maximally responsible for all events.</p></li><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Therefore God is maximally responsible for all events.</p></li></ol><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The intuition here is that, the common-sense distinction between doing something, and allowing something to happen does not hold for a being of unlimited power, and unlimited knowledge. Mackie argues that this everyday distinction is motivated by two considerations</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">A) If we bring something about, there is effort we exert, but if we allow something to happen there is not. The less effort we must exert to prevent the given state of affairs, the more responsible we are.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">B) Letting something happen is often associated with some degree of inadvertedness, while bringing something about requires great attentiveness. The more attentive one is, the greater their responsibility is.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">But A, and B become inapplicable as power and knowledge increases without limit. It would seem that for a being with unlimited power and unlimited vision, this distinction would not hold at all. So a being that is omniscient and omnipotent does everything. Note this does not mean that free creatures do nothing, but as Mackie I think cogently argues, God is in complete control of people's free choices.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Once we realize the distinction between God actualizing an ideal world, and allowing creatures to participate in the actualization of an ideal world collapses due to God's omnifiscence, Buck is once again open to the question; Why did God not actualize an ideal world from the get-go? If not, at the very least, why did God permit all this horrific suffering? It cannot be because God wanted to allow His creatures to participate in the creation of an ideal world, because if the above argument is right, then all the same, their participation just is His participation.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Even if Mackie's argument is unsound, nonetheless I think we have good reason to think the distiction the theodicy rests on does not do the work Buck requires. We can ask the obvious question, even if free creatures participating in the creation of an ideal world is all-things-considered better than the world where God alone participates. Why then, did God not actualize the world where free creatures never make decisions which hinder the creation of an ideal world, free creatures who always freely choose to do good and who's actions are always directed at the creation of an ideal world, never comitting horrific moral evils. Prima facie, that state of affairs seems to be better than the state of affairs where free creatures often do evil, which we find in the actual world. How could Buck respond? Well, plausibly, if God did that, then His creatures wouldn't truly be free, and they would not truly be participating in the creation of an ideal world without the aid of God. But this would be to remove intrinsic goods that would otherwise exist.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This won't do though for a few reasons. First, consider that it seems God could actualize the truth-conditions for counterfactuals of creaturely freedom. A counterfactual of creaturely freedom would be a conditional statement like the following;</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">C*) "If S were to obtain, Smith would do A"</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Where S represents all relevant states of affairs prior to Smith's choice, and A is, for our purposes, a freely chosen action that has the property of being morally right. It seems God could actualize such truth-makers where free creatures, in the circumstances God actualizes, always do good, and always contribute to the creation of the ideal world. Why might it be the case that God cannot make such counterfactuals true? Afterall, such counterfactuals are contingent truths, and God is omnipotent. Buck might argue that if God, prior to creation, actualizes the truth-conditions of such counterfactuals, then agents would not truly be free, and God would simply be causing agents to do the right thing. This, it seems to me, is not right. For one, God making C* true would not entail that there is a necessitating causal relation between the antecedent and the consequent of the conditional. Yes, God would cause the proposition C* to be true, but this does not entail that the action included in C* is itself causally determined, it can still be freely chosen. For two, even if God did not actualize the truth-conditions for C*, it would still seem that C* or some other mutually exclusive counterfactual would be true even if by happenstance, and so God by actualizing S or any set of circumstances that would constitute the antecedent of the given counterfactual, would nonetheless make it true that Smith does A or A* (whatever actions those specify).</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Another reason this won't seem to do, is that it seems, by the theists own lights, God is an essentially morally perfect entity and yet always does the right action. So, it's on the participation theodicist to show that God could not actualize beings who, like Him, are both essentially morally perfect and completely free, in which case God could have actualize a world, where there are none but perfect creatures like Him participating in the actualization of an ideal world.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Finally, it seems like the nature created beings are endowed with, explain why creatures make the choices they do. Since no creature is responsible for their nature, not even God (This is easily proved, if God were to choose to have a perfectly good nature, then God would first have to have such a nature that is motivated to make such a choice. Thus God's nature is logically prior to His choices) then that creatures are, beforehand, actualized with the right sort of natures does not at all take away their responsibility for their actions. So, it's unclear why God could not actualize creatures with natures that are morally perfect, or at least far less disposed towards moral evils in the process of contributing to the ideal world.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Objection 3.</strong></em></p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The final objection I will present, is that, even if Buck is able to successfully answer the first two objections, the participation theodicy is still, I believe, impotent against the best formulations of the problem of evil which is inference to the best explanation/Bayesian arguments. The one I will be focusing on here, will be Draper's <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2215486" class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">infamous argument</a> from pain and pleasure. The basic argument goes as follows;</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">On naturalism, given our background information of evolution by natural selection and that organisms are goal-directed biological systems. Antecedently, what we'd expect is that, generally all functional traits of organisms including pleasure and pain, contribute to the biological goals of reproduction or survival, and the times they don't is explained by the imperfect tuning of our biological processes (E.g burning to death doesn't need to be that painful for the biological goals of an organism to be satisfied). On theism, the inference from the background information of natural selection, to pleasure and pain serving biological functions is undercut, since it needs to also be true that God's desires, or moral reasons, happen to align with pleasure and pain happening to align with the biological goals of survival and reproductive success. Antecedently, we have some reason to expect God to treat pleasure and pain differently then other functional properties, since pleasure and pain have moral value, and God being morally perfect, ceteris paribus would be expected to have compassion for His creatures and not permit their horrific suffering unless He has a morally justifying reason to do so. The theist can tell an auxiliary story to explain why, on theism God permits horrific pain and allows that pleasure and pain happen to serve biological functions, but of course this story will inevitably be much less virtuous then the naturalists, more straightforward explanation.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The participation theodicy is utterly powerless against this argument because it only explains general facts, such as why we are not in an ideal world, why there are horrific instances of suffering. It gives us no reason to antecedently expect specific facts about pain and pleasure being tied to the goals of organisms etc. While it can explain the general fact of why there is horrific evils, it provides no explanation for such specific facts. Thus, it fails to address Draper's argument.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Interestingly, Buck, in his <a href="https://youtu.be/VjiseJXa2yQ?t=4417" class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">conversation</a> with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@EmersonGreen" class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">Emerson Green</a>, responds to the argument. I'm low on space so I'll just address a couple of his responses. He argues the theodicy will grant that pain and pleasure being morally correlated would be an ideal world, but on the theodicy we will start out with a non-ideal world, so it's fine that we start out with pain and pleasure being biologically and non-morally correlated. Granted, on the theodicy it could be that we start out with a world where pains and pleasures happen to serve biological rather than moral roles, but this gives us no antecedent reason whatsoever to expect such a specific link between pain and pleasure and these biological functions, God could have actualized a world where pain and pleasure are linked to infinitely other physical states or functions, why is it that God's desires/moral reasons happen to align with the precise psychophysical connections we see? On naturalism, we do have such an antecedent reason. He then argues that because epiphenomenalism is consistent with naturalism and evolution, this undercuts the inference we would be able to make on naturalism and evolution that pain and pleasure will have these correlations. I think this both misunderstands the argument, and epiphenomenalism.  The argument holds, not that it is necessary that pain and pleasure will have such functions, but that we can inductively reason from our background information that, since all these other functions (including phenomenal properties) are correlated with biological goals, we would expect pain and pleasure to work the same way. Epiphenomenalism holds that mental states themselves do not have causal powers, not that they cannot causally supervene on physical properties, all our evidence suggests that they do so causally supervene.</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  "  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  "  >  A     C  r  i  t  i  c  a  l     R  e  f  l  e  c  t  i  o  n     o  n     s  o  m  e     I  n  t  e  r  e  s  t  i  n  g     T  h  e  o  d  i  c  i  e  s  <  /  h  1  >
