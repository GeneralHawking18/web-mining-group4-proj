During his closing arguments, Brook's blamed God's will for his own actions. Many took offense to this, but if you believe in an omni-God, is he wrong? This is ultimately the problem of evil in philosophy of religion. Why would a deity which is both omnipotent &amp; omniscient allow for evil to exist? As Epicurus famously said, “Is God willing to prevent evil, but unable? Then He is impotent. Is he able, but not willing? Then He is malevolent. Is he both able &amp; willing? Whence then is evil?”</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a href="https://youtu.be/zovPGnVXxDo" class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/zovPGnVXxDo</a></p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  "  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  "  >  D  a  r  r  e  l  l     B  r  o  o  k  s     &  a  m  p  ;     t  h  e     P  r  o  b  l  e  m     o  f     E  v  i  l  <  /  h  1  >
