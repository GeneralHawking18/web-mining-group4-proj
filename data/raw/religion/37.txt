Christianity, as defined by its scriptures, claims that its scriptures were written by YHWH and are suitable guidance for Christians (2 Timothy 3:16). Christians refer to their scriptures as "the word of god" and similar terms. If the Christians' scriptures were truly written by YHWH and Christians were guided by YHWH, then they would be easily able to distinguish YHWH's scriptures from lesser writings. After all, YHWH, according to the Christians' scriptures, cannot lie (Titus 1:2, Hebrews 6:18). But Christians cannot agree about what constitutes their scriptures, which in turn suggests that YHWH's alleged wisdom and writing cannot easily be distinguished from human writings - in turn undermining the justification for trusting the Christians' scriptures as special and worthy of trust by Christians because they were written by YHWH.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The Roman Catholics add to the scriptures used by Protestants the following texts: Tobit, Judith, portions of Esther, 1 Maccabees, 2 Maccabees, Wisdom of Solomon, Ecclesiasticus (also known as Sirach), Baruch, Letter of Jeremiah, The Prayer of Azariah and Song of the Three Holy Children to the Book of Daniel, the story of Susanna to the Book of Daniel, and the story of Bel and the Dragon to the Book of Daniel.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The Eastern Orthodox churches have added the following texts in addition to what the Roman Catholics have added: 3 Maccabees, 4 Maccabees (Georgian church only), 1 Esdras, 2 Esdras (Georgian church only), Odes, Psalm 151, Psalms 152-155 (Syriac Peshitta only), Baruch 2 (Syriac Peshitta only), and the Prayer of Manasseh.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The Ethiopian Orthodox add the following texts in addition to the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Texts: Books of Enoch, Book of Jubilees, Rest of the Words of Baruch (aka Paralipomena of Baruch), 1 Meqabyan, 2 Meqabyan, 3 Meqabyan.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And in the past, Christians have had even stranger conflicts about which texts should be regarded as scripture. For example, a text claiming to be Paul's Epistle to the Laodiceans was included in some early Latin texts of the New Testament, and was cited by Pope Gregory the Great and included in John Wycliffe's translation, but Jerome and many others believed it to be a forgery - which modern Christianity agrees with even as it agrees about little else. Yet a Pope thought otherwise!</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The Christian, noting my flair, may assert that Buddhism is no better with its Mahayana and Tantric scriptures, to say nothing of its treasure texts - which are and have been condemned by Buddhists from various sects as forgeries. But such a claim would not address my argument in this post.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Edited in order to add: My argument in this thread is not about when texts were added or removed, but rather about how different Christian denominations have different scriptures. I used the Protestant Christian scriptures and the concept of other denominations adding to their scriptures not because I was claiming that other sects literally added to Protestant scriptures but in order to more effectively convey how Protestant Christian Scriptures, far from being universally accepted among Christians as complete, are a base to which other Christian sects have added texts.</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  "  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  "  >  T  h  e     f  a  c  t     t  h  a  t     C  h  r  i  s  t  i  a  n  s     c  o  u  l  d     n  o  t     a  n  d     c  a  n  n  o  t     a  g  r  e  e     a  b  o  u  t     w  h  a  t     w  o  r  k  s     b  e  l  o  n  g     w  i  t  h  i  n     t  h  e  i  r     s  c  r  i  p  t  u  r  e  s     i  s     d  e  v  a  s  t  a  t  i  n  g     t  o     c  l  a  i  m  s     f  o  r     C  h  r  i  s  t  i  a  n     a  u  t  h  o  r  i  t  y  .  <  /  h  1  >
