And without God, how can we know how to behave?</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">While I don't claim to have all the answers, and I know that others have given better answers that I, the question was asked of me, so I felt compelled to try to give a thoughtful response, based on first principles. My goal is not to demean or to change anyone's mind, but to help a thoughtful theist come to understand and respect a scientific perspective. Here is what came to mind...</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Part 1. Where did we come from?</strong></p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Where did we come from? First, let’s admit that nobody knows. How do we come to know anything? Oftentimes, it’s by reasoning about observations. So, let’s start with one of the simplest observations. It appears that there is something rather than nothing. Planets, trees, paperclips, and we ourselves appear to be here. Most of us agree with this observation, and if we didn’t, there’d be nothing to explain, so for sake of conversation, let’s assume for now that we do in fact exist.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Supposing stuff does exist, it seems reasonable to ask how it got here - where did it come from? The fact that we think an explanation is needed here implies that we all share a certain idea of what counts as a good explanation. Oil and vinegar is a good explanation for salad dressing; eating soap is a good explanation for getting sick; and the idea that the world is round is a good explanation for how a traveler moving in any straight line will eventually arrive where she started.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">But it’s easy to imagine how things could have been different. Salad dressing could have been made from other ingredients; the kid who ate soap might have already been sick from a stomach flu; and the world could have been more ovular in shape. So the fact that we think explanations are needed implies that certain things do demand explanation. And the fact that some explanations are better than others implies that we all have certain standards for what counts as a good explanation.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Let’s explore some possible explanations for all this stuff in our world. First, it could be that it all came from nothing. But this seems like a pretty unsatisfying explanation because it doesn’t actually explain anything. How exactly could something come from nothing? In ordinary life, we have no single example of anything ever having come from nothing, and if it did, we’d have no natural explanation for how it did that, or how we could make it happen again. Even on the quantum scale, where photons appear to come from nowhere, we have no current explanation for how this happens. If we conclude that it happens as the result of supernatural forces, we haven’t explained anything. We’ve just put a label on a mystery. But just because we don’t know the explanation doesn’t mean it can’t be explained one day according to natural laws. There are innumerable examples in history of solving mysteries in this way.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">If we were to conclude that something came from nothing, then our definition of nothing must be wrong because if something came from it, then it wasn’t really nothing to begin with. That’s just true by definition. Since, to our best knowledge, something can’t literally come from absolutely nothing, maybe the stuff of this world has always only ever come from other stuff. Something can surely come from something else. Of course, this explanation might not be immediately satisfying because it implies an infinite regress of causes - a cosmic passing of the buck. We have an intuition that there must be a first cause - the original stuff. The problem is that if there is a first cause, we’re right back at square one, looking for an explanation for that stuff.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">It’s in situations like these that we should reflect on our assumptions and whether they could be wrong. For one, maybe there are mysteries that our minds can’t solve. Maybe the world is here because of supernatural forces, and maybe we can call that God, and we’ll take it on faith that God is the first cause. Ok, but if we think this, we’ve drastically lowered our bar for what counts as a good explanation. By lowering the bar to that degree, we’re forced to contend with innumerable other explanations for existence, like that the universe was born from Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Spaghetti_Monster" class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">flying spaghetti monster</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Turtle" class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">on the back of a turtle</a>, as some religions teach. Taking things on faith unfortunately opens us up to believe all kinds of fictions and falsehoods, making it impossible to tell truth from fiction. This is fine only if you think the search for truth is completely meaningless.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">So, if we stand by the premise that something can’t ultimately come from nothing, then maybe there’s a flaw in our assumption that there must be a first cause. If something always comes from something else, why does that strike us as a bad explanation? I suspect the answer has to do with the great difficulty human minds have trying to understand the meaning of the concepts “nothing” and “the infinite”. All along we’ve been assuming that “nothing” means there is objectively nothing present, and “infinity” refers to something that is objectively endless. We think of them as polar opposites. But how can we be sure these characterizations are true? No scientist has ever successfully observed absolute nothingness or absolute infinity. In fact, scientists who have attempted to take measurements of “nothing” (that is, a vacuum) have found quite the opposite of nothing: their measurements reveal that <a href="https://www.insidescience.org/news/study-about-nothing" class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">vacuums have energetic states</a>. So “nothing” and “infinity” have something interesting in common. When we try to describe them at the elemental level, we can describe them both as energetic states. “Nothing” and “infinity” are also both believed to be homogenous states, meaning that each one can be understood in some sense as uniform. There’s an adage that fish will be the last to discover water. This is an apt analogy here because it shows how one and the same substance can be perceived as both vast and absent, depending on one’s point of view. Fish might not notice water because it uniformly permeates everything in their world, much like humans once believed that the air in our atmosphere is empty space; to a bird, of course, there is nothing empty about air.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">In daily life, we think of “nothing” in an absolute sense because it appears to be empty, static, and uniform relative to our lived experience. But to mistake this state for truly nothing in an absolute sense just reveals our own bias - much like we conceive of the earth as being motionless. From a broader perspective, it can only be described as motionless relative to us.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This relational property of the universe means that nothing and infinity might not be polar opposites. Imagine a person who believes that the earth is flat and can’t conceive of it being any other way. If this person were to travel in a perfectly straight line, say, Eastward, along the equator, eventually they would return to their origin point. The flat earther would be astonished. In their mind, East and West are polar opposites. So, they might think they had traveled through a wormhole hole. Of course, we know that East and West are not strict opposites, and the traveler’s reappearing act can be easily explained by assuming the earth is spherical. But to achieve that understanding, we had to think in three dimensions instead of two. Likewise, the seemingly mysterious properties of “nothingness” and “infinity” could be an indication that they are not the polar opposites that they appear to be in our three-dimensional perspective, but are closely related properties of a higher-dimensional phenomenon.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The lesson here is that “nothing” and “infinity” could conceivably be, not absolute states, but relational states, two manifestations of a single fundamental entity. If emptiness and infinity are ultimately manifestations of the same thing, then it’s meaningless to ask what caused stuff to come into being because, at the most fundamental level that we can comprehend, something has always been there. It’s the changes in that cosmic stuff, the temporary perturbations that, like waves on the ocean’s surface, form the relational states that we know as life.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">It’s a bewildering thought. And I'm the first to admit that I have no idea what lies beyond our three-dimensional existence. But should our bewilderment serve as evidence that the universe must have been created by God? I don’t think so because, as discussed above, attributing creation to God is no more explanatory than attributing it to a spaghetti monster, and more importantly, because there might be no first cause as we understand it. So whether God exists or not, the explanation for our universe remains mysterious, at least for the foreseeable future. In the meantime, we have a choice: we can take that mystery on faith, or we can study it, measure it, test it, challenge and revise our own assumptions until we achieve, however slightly, a richer understanding of this amazing world we live in.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Part 2. How should we behave?</strong></p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Holding aside questions about the nature of the universe, there remains a more practical question. If God doesn’t exist,  how can we all get along? How would we agree on what is good? To whom would we hold ourselves accountable?</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">These are difficult questions, and I won’t pretend to have all the right answers. But there’s reason to believe that it’s not a lost cause. Denying the belief in God does not necessitate a world of chaos, selfishness, violence, and debauchery. The challenge is this: to develop systems of cooperation that sustain themselves on the basis of rules that are likely to be honored by individuals with competing interests. One way to approach this challenge is to study, scientifically, what sorts of systems of cooperation work better than others.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">But first, why should we cooperate in the first place? If God doesn’t exist, what would motivate us to play nice? One motivation could be that it feels good to be nice. But that’s a hard sell because sometimes it also feels good to be selfish, so this makes it hard to know when to follow which motivation. Another motivation could be that it’s ultimately in our best interest to make sacrifices now for greater gains later. For example, forgoing a paycheck now to finish a high-school education could help a graduate cultivate the skills and resources they need to earn a larger paycheck later and serve both themselves and their community in a more effective way. Giving up drinking now could help someone be a better parent, which in turn will tend to help to raise a healthier, more virtuous child, and thus a healthier future relationship that benefits both parties much more than the instant gratification that alcohol could bring. But for such a motivation to be adopted, people really need to believe it, and to really believe it, it needs to usually prove itself true. So a good system of rules is one that delivers on its promises.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Many religious traditions would claim to meet this definition. They are systems of rules that purport that good things will come to those who follow their rules. This is essentially what the Golden Rule is all about, which is foundational to so many religions and non-religious traditions. But does the Golden Rule always deliver on its promises? Of course not. It’s just a rule of thumb. So how do we get people to follow the rule when it doesn’t deliver? Many religions try to do that through faith; Others through authority; Others through ritual. Many of these great efforts to get people to follow the rules have won the hearts of particular individuals. But none of them have won the hearts of all mankind. I think this is because, for some people to be adequately motivated, they require stronger evidence that the rules will tend to deliver on their promises. For many people, that means discovering a set of rules that generate payoffs in this lifetime.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">So, how can we discover such a set of rules? The scientific method suggests that we should be able to discover such rules through the systematic observation of our own world—that’s the only place we can observe after all. One starting point might be to observe the people for whom the rules are clearly not working: the downtrodden, who have labored hard each day simply for a roof over their head and a meal in their belly, and still have nothing to show for it. The sinners, who abuse others for personal gratification. Maybe instead of promising them reward or punishment in the afterlife and expecting them to take it on faith, it behooves us to help them identify the future payoffs of good behavior in this life. To do that, we need to study what’s failing them. Is it a systemic, economic problem, like the lack of mechanisms for upward mobility? Is it the lack of mental health resources necessary to persist in the face of these obstacles? A combination? There may be hundreds, or thousands, of barriers to thriving, and the prevalence of these societal problems is evidence that much more work is needed to be done to identify the changes to the rulebook that are needed to promote thriving. Instead of expecting the faithless to take it on faith, we could try to find a way to give them something they have reason to believe in. So, what should motivate us to play nice without God? A constructed system of rules that can consistently prove its own worth to ordinary people.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Even if there are good reasons to play nice without God, how can we go about doing it? If one person thinks it’s good to steal and another does not, how can we decide who’s right without appealing to a higher authority? Again, this is a hard question, and we don’t have all the answers yet. But a partial answer is that stealing is wrong to the extent that we can consistently demonstrate situations in which individuals who forgo stealing from one another both do better in the long run. What counts as “doing better” is largely self-evident and already agreed on by theists and non-theists alike, like having consistent access to food, shelter, social support, etc.. In this framework, studying the social rules and mechanisms that best facilitate such outcomes is a rational act of service.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">If we don’t know whether God exists, wouldn’t it be more rational to assume he does exist and be wrong than to assume he does not exist and be wrong? In this view, if he does exist, the faithless will suffer eternal damnation, whereas if he doesn’t, the faithful will have forgone only some minor inconveniences in this life. This idea is known as Pascal’s Wager, named after the 17th-Century French theologian who made a rational argument for believing in God. It would be a compelling argument if we had absolute uncertainty about whether God exists or not. If we had absolutely no idea either way—that is, if our odds of being wrong were 50/50—then eternal damnation surely does seem the one to avoid. But here’s the catch: our uncertainty about God’s existence is not 50/50. We have vast libraries of scientific knowledge about how matter behaves and the rules of what can cause what. So far, virtually all of it has been explained without positing the existence of God - all except for the first cause - but as we discussed above, positing that God exists does not actually help to explain that. So given that the existence of God defies probability, it turns out that believing he does not exist is not a very big risk after all. Consider driving a car. Driving has inherent risks. The cost of getting in a serious car accident while driving to the grocery store on a given day is certainly worse than the cost of not driving to the store that day. And if the odds of getting into an accident were 50/50, it would indeed be rational to stay home and order your groceries online, even if that’s more expensive in the short term. But the odds of getting into a car accident on a given day are not 50/50, and we know this from hard data. The risk is not zero, but it’s small enough that we could justifiably conclude that driving to the grocery store is worth the risk. The same is true for the belief in God. Does this rational case for denying the existence of God mean we should abandon all social rules governing human behavior? Only if you have no other reason for being good. But as we have discussed, we have other good reasons for being good.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Most of us are seekers of truth, but we vary in our standards of proof for deciding what’s true. Those who adopt a scientific perspective are not ready to give up on natural explanations because, over the long term, their approach has an unsurpassed track record. This is because they commit themselves to an extremely high standard of proof. Their approach is not a quick fix - it’s a slow and laborious process. But even if they fail to answer the biggest questions in the end, their efforts will not be in vain because their journey can only bring us closer. Anyone who cares about truth should find comfort in this.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Postscript: I'm happy to concede that I could be wrong about all of this. If, one day, God appears to me to invalidate my views, I'm willing to stand corrected. That’s the beauty of the scientific perspective - it’s amenable to revision and improvement. But he'd have his work cut out for him because, to persuade a scientist of an extraordinary claim, one must have extraordinary evidence. Mere voices and miracles are not enough since those can likely be explained as hallucinations or illusions. Instead, God would have to prove his existence to us using scientific standards or else prove why our standards are wrong. Since the only way to verify the truth of a proposition is through a combination of observation and reason, then I have to expect God, like any meaningful phenomenon, to be observable and reasonable, and if he is not, I cannot be expected to find truth in God. So I have no worries about eternal damnation. If God is the all-good, all-knowing, all-powerful figure some think he is, then when my time of reckoning comes, he will not damn me for this stance on life. If anything, he may reward me for it because defending a high standard of truth in a world full of doubt is a greater act of service than mere faith alone. If he meets these high standards or proves to me why they are wrong, only then will I believe in him. That’s a risk I’m willing to take.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I don't expect all readers to agree with me about all this. And I still think individuals can lead a good life without enlisting in the scientific worldview. Not everyone needs to be guided by that view, just like not everyone needs to be a plumber. But it's a good thing that we have plumbers. And for those of us who are not, it behooves us to learn a thing or two about how a toilet works. After all, it could save our ass someday.</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  "  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  "  >  T  h  e     u  n  i  v  e  r  s  e     i  s     a     c  l  o  g  g  e  d     t  o  i  l  e  t  ,     s  c  i  e  n  c  e     i  s     t  h  e     p  l  u  m  b  e  r  ,     a  n  d     G  o  d     i  s     M  I  A  .  <  /  h  1  >
