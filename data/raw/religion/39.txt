<div class="_3xX726aBn29LDbsDtzr_6E _1Ap4F5maDtT1E1YuCiaO0r D3IL3FD0RFy_mkKLPwL4" style="max-width:800px" data-click-id="text" data-adclicklocation="media"><div class="_292iotee39Lmt0MkQZ2hPV RichTextJSON-root"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">When asked why there must be an objective morality created by god, Christians often reply "well because if there weren't, how could we know what was good and what was bad?" But this isn't an appeal to any sort of evidence, it is an appeal to one's desires to be comfortable and to make sense of the world.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">While it might feel good to believe that there is some underlying rule of the universe that delineates what is right and what is wrong, and it might be easier to believe this, that does not mean that any such rule exists. If objective morality did not exist we would not be able to state exactly what is good and what is bad with 100% certainty. Good and evil would ultimately be based on opinion. So what? Neither of those statements prove anything. They prove that for some people it may be more comfortable to believe in objective morality, but neither statement proves that there must be an objective morality. It might be scarier to live in a world where morality is based on opinion and no moral prescription is set in stone, but tough luck, that's the world we live in. Just because something is scary doesn't mean it isn't also a fact of life.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">It might be more comfortable to believe that smoking cigarettes does not cause cancer. It might be more comfortable to believe that we never have to go to the dentist. It might be rather intuitive to believe we never have to go to the dentist. After all, we brush our teeth right? Therefore it makes sense that we shouldn't get cavities. However, defaulting to the most simple or most comfortable mode of thinking may cause us to miss important details and come to the wrong conclusion. It may be more comfortable and intuitive to believe the world is flat. However, the fact that it is comfortable and intuitive does not prove that it is the case.</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  "  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  "  >  E  v  e  n     i  f     o  b  j  e  c  t  i  v  e     m  o  r  a  l  i  t  y     i  s     c  o  m  f  o  r  t  i  n  g     t  o     b  e  l  i  e  v  e     i  n     a  n  d     f  e  e  l  s     i  n  t  u  i  t  i  v  e  ,     n  e  i  t  h  e  r     o  r     t  h  o  s  e     t  h  i  n  g  s     m  a  k  e     i  t     a  n  y     m  o  r  e     l  i  k  e  l  y     t  o     e  x  i  s  t     t  h  a  n     s  u  b  j  e  c  t  i  v  e     m  o  r  a  l  i  t  y  .  <  /  h  1  >
