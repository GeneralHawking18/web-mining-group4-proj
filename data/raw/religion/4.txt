So to educate this subreddit I'll just make a few points on the differences that make Islam unique.</p><ol class="_1eJr7K139jnMstd4HajqYP"><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Islam does not claim to be a 'new' religion. It's a continuation of previous messengers of Allah that all carried the same message; 'There is One God, He is Unique, He is Uncreated, We are his Creation and we must worship him alone, and no other deity or creation.' Messengers have appeared from the inception of humankind, Adam being the first and Mohammed being the last. In between, there have been over 100,000 messengers sent to mankind to each specific nation according to Islam.</p></li><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Islam is the only one to claim it's the last message of Allah and it's sent for all of Mankind and Mohammed (peace be upon him) is the last messenger.</p></li><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The Quran is the only text that can be verified and traced back to the time of its inception (When it was revealed to Mohammed). This point is extremely important, as to base your worldview upon something, you must be sure it's the true authentic message and not corrupted.</p></li><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The Quran is free from Contradiction and there are claims inside the Quran to prove its validity. The main ones are, 'The promise of Allah to preserve the message until the end of time', 'To not contain any contradictions' (as this would negate it being from an all Knowledgable creator), 'A challenge to create a verse like it'. If any of these are broken, the validity of the Quran will be false.</p></li></ol><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">There are others, but I feel like these are important to point out as generally, people talk of Islam while making basic errors. If there are any misconceptions anyone has, I'd be happy to clear them up. All I ask is that you present it in a respectful way and be sincere in your discourse and conduct.</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  "  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  "  >  W  h  y     I  s  l  a  m     i  s     u  n  i  q  u  e     a  m  o  n  g  s  t     a  l  l     o  t  h  e  r     m  a  j  o  r     r  e  l  i  g  i  o  n  s  <  /  h  1  >
