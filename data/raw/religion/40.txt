Also if god is so good and real than people should have no doubts about his existence but they do. If you don’t believe in god than every good thing, every person you’ve ever helped, every person who’s day was made thanks to your good actions do not matter if you don’t believe in god. God should care about us being good people, not believing in him. He should be happy to show people the way but instead he leaves it up to you.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Last thing, isn’t the reason god tried flooding earth was cause we were bad? Just cause you believe in god doesn’t make you a good person, there are some awful Christians. Also not all athiest are bad people and sometimes do better than Christian’s whitch is kinda contradictory of the point of believing.</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  "  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  "  >  G  o  d     c  a  r  e  s     m  o  r  e     a  b  o  u  t     y  o  u     b  e  l  i  e  v  i  n  g     i  n     h  i  m     t  h  e  n     a  c  t  u  a  l  l  y     b  e  i  n  g     a     g  o  o  d     p  e  r  s  o  n  <  /  h  1  >
