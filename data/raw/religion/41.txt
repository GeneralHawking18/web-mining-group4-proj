However, I’ve heard many atheists say it would be unfair of God to send anyone to hell if he gave us free will and we are just exercising that gift.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Free will is not an argument against consequences. If a cop tells you that he will give you a ticket if you speed, you still have the free will to speed, but you may have to suffer the consequence of a ticket.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Like I said, I’m not religious but I think that argument isn’t necessarily good. Just my opinion.</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  "  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  "  >  S  a  y  i  n  g     G  o  d     g  a  v  e     u  s     f  r  e  e     w  i  l  l     i  s     n  o  t     a     g  o  o  d     a  r  g  u  m  e  n  t     a  g  a  i  n  s  t     h  e  l  l  .  <  /  h  1  >
