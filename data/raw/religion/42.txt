Yet they have one of the simplest religions because here is the thing: According to Christianity Jesus died for everyone's sins correct? And by accepting him and God you are saved correct? Then talking of sin and hell is of the devil because all it does is push people away from God. Instead of speaking of that Christians should do what Jesus told them was the two greatest commandments above the others: Love God and Love Thy Neighbor. <em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE">EVERYTHING else in the Bible is irrelevant.</em> Jesus already took all of your sins. Oh that woman got an abortion? She is saved anyway. Jesus got her. Oh those men are gay and in a relationship? Again even if a sin by the Bible <em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE">Jesus already died for them too. They just have to accept it.</em> I guarantee if this was how the large part of Christianity that is shown was and they denounced all the hate groups pretending to be Christians it would be a much better religion.</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  "  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  "  >  C  h  r  i  s  t  i  a  n  i  t  y     n  e  e  d  s     t  o     s  t  o  p     t  a  l  i  i  n  g     a  b  o  u  t     h  e  l  l     a  n  d     s  i  n     b  e  c  a  u  s  e     i  t     i  s     p  o  i  n  t  l  e  s  s  .  <  /  h  1  >
