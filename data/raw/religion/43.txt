Insisting that you've defined your god as being able to start the universe is in absolutely no way evidence that your god started the universe. No more so than my keys not being here "proves" they were taken by key gnomes. The reason theists don't agree with this is part of being a theist is adopting one set of logic that you use for most everything and a second set of bad logical rules, excuses, and exceptions that are only employed for a theist's chosen religion. This is why, for example, modern day Christians would laugh at the idea of Thor being responsible for thunder (or any non-Christian religious claim) yet insist that Yahweh is the exception for which this bad logic "works". It doesn't.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">So when people talk about the Kalam cosmological argument, first causes, etc., they are talking about fictional things who exist purely in the realm of fairy tales (like Voldemort or Pokemon creatures). To instantiate them outside of fiction, there has to be evidence. "But my fictional thing solves a real world unknown" isn't evidence. It's just another claim that requires evidence.</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  "  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  "  >  A  n     i  m  a  g  i  n  a  r  y     c  r  e  a  t  u  r  e  ,     e  v  e  n     o  n  e     w  h  o  s  e     t  r  a  i  t  s     s  o  l  v  e     s  o  m  e     u  n  k  n  o  w  n     i  n     t  h  e     r  e  a  l     w  o  r  l  d  ,     i  s     s  t  i  l  l     p  u  r  e  l  y     f  i  c  t  i  o  n  a  l     &  a  m  p  ;     i  m  a  g  i  n  a  r  y     w  i  t  h  o  u  t     e  v  i  d  e  n  c  e  <  /  h  1  >
