<div class="_3xX726aBn29LDbsDtzr_6E _1Ap4F5maDtT1E1YuCiaO0r D3IL3FD0RFy_mkKLPwL4" style="max-width:800px" data-click-id="text" data-adclicklocation="media"><div class="_292iotee39Lmt0MkQZ2hPV RichTextJSON-root"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Everything the Bible deems as "sinful" or "wicked" is simply biological, neurological, chemical and physiological processes deeply coded in our DNA and biomass, and the spectrum of humanity is too vast and complex to put people in one of two boxes, "damned" or "saved". (This also applies to Abrahamic religion in general, and most worldwide religions)</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Tribalism is a prominent reason why what the Bible regards as "evil" and "bad" is simply just nonsensical defamation of the human being. As humans, we collaborate and cooperate, but also challenge each other and compete against one another. There is nothing in the entirety of human history dating back to the origin of human existence that suggests we were ever anything different, or that we are destined to become one with an external, supernatural being that has the ability to collect our souls and transfer us into another realm entirely, on the condition that we pledged our utmost unquestioning and unadulterated obedience and submission to that supreme entity.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The reality of human nature is slandered by the Bible and Christianity itself as a way to exercise control and power over the common population, where critical thinking was underdeveloped, education was scarce, and superstition and ignorance was at the forefront of the majority of people in Biblical times, especially regarding the history and culture of the stories depicted.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Lying, stealing, cheating, hating, murdering (and don't forget mass fucking and orgies) ... other animals, namely mammals (which human beings would be categorized as if we were put in the same box under the same labels as the animal kingdom) are capable of doing all of those things, and there is no evidence to suggest otherwise.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Animals are also capable of altruism, self-sacrifice and teamwork, something which humans would highly regard and value as "honorable" and "noble". What a human being would consider as having "integrity" and "honesty", is really just in the grand scheme of things a survival mechanism.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Human beings work better together, than against each other, and that's that. There is also no proof nor evidence to suggest that the god depicted in the Abrahamic religions, namely Christianity, is anything more than an abstract concept formulated as an extension of mankind that showcases their narcissism, entitlement and desire to exercise power and control with others. The idea that Christianity is somehow different and is a "relationship with God" instead of just any mere religion is also just mere delusion and a coping mechanism that assists believers with getting through life.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">TL;DR - Human beings are painted as terrible beings in the Bible and Christianity even though it makes no sense to put them down as such because they are no different than the other living beings on the planet.</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  "  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  "  >  T  h  e     r  e  a  l  i  t  y     o  f     h  u  m  a  n     n  a  t  u  r  e     i  s     s  l  a  n  d  e  r  e  d     b  y     C  h  r  i  s  t  i  a  n  i  t  y     a  n  d     t  h  e     B  i  b  l  e     i  t  s  e  l  f  <  /  h  1  >
