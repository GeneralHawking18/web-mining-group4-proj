Titus 1:2 and Hebrews 6:18 assert that YHWH cannot lie. Romans 3:4 encourages Christians to regard YHWH's words as true even if all people must be regarded as liars.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Stringing these claims into a coherent picture, we get the following claim easily enough: because the Christians' scriptures were written by an always truthful entity, Christians should believe the Christians' scriptures rather than any human claims which contradict the Christians' scriptures.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Nor should this be regarded as an empty hypothetical. Christians exist who are willing to be guided by their scriptures in rejecting, among other things, evolution, deep time, the world's sphericity, and even the germ theory of disease, the role of mental health services in dealing with mental illness, and the role of medicine in treating disease. The Westboro Baptists have even accepted as true the controversial doctrine that YHWH causes bad things in the world (which is supported by the Christians' scriptures, as I have shown), rejecting claims by Christian theologians that YHWH does not cause bad things in the world.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Therefore, Christians should not be surprised when non-Christians expect Christians' beliefs to be guided by the Christians' scriptures rather than by contrary opinions.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Any Christian who accuses my argument of taking verses out of context indirectly condemns the Christians' scriptures.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This is because the Christian scriptures include Christian interpretation of the Hebrew Scriptures, in which authors in the Christian scriptures will take single phrases or verses completely out of context in order to claim, falsely, that they support Christian theology. For example, GMatthew 2:14-15 explicitly cites Hosea's statement about YHWH's calling his son out of Egypt as evidence that Jesus's trip to and from Egypt was in fulfilment of a prophecy - completely ignoring that in the context of Hosea's writings, the son called from Egypt is clearly a personified Israel, with the journey from Egypt's being already fulfilled in Hosea's time by the Exodus (Hosea 11:1).</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Similarly, GMatthew 2:16-18 presents Herod's actions against infants as a fulfilment of Jeremiah 31:15. But Jeremiah 31:15 is part of a longer prophecy about the Jews' return from exile (Jeremiah 31, especially 31:15-17) that the Bible presents as having been fulfilled by Cyrus, not a prophecy about a future massacre of children.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">As a final example, consider Paul's claim in Romans 3:12 that "there is none that doeth good, no, not one" as part of his argument about how we all need YHWH's salvation through Jesus. Paul says in Romans 3:10, however, that he is quoting what is written, presumably within the Hebrew Scriptures. Psalms 14 and 53 both contain (at 14:3 and 53:3) the phrase "there is none that doeth good, no, not one". However, since Psalms 14 and 53 both open (at 14:1 and 53:1) with condemnation of all atheists as corrupt and wicked fools, it is easy to understand Psalms 14 and 53 (at 14:3 and 53:3), with their phrase "there is none that doeth good, no, not one", as condemning atheists rather than all people. Certainly, this narrower view is supported by GJohn 5:29, 2 Corinthians 5:10, and 3 John 11, all of which talk about people doing good.</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  "  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  "  >  B  e  c  a  u  s  e     o  f     w  h  a  t     t  h  e     C  h  r  i  s  t  i  a  n  s  '     s  c  r  i  p  t  u  r  e  s     s  a  y     a  b  o  u  t     t  h  e  m  s  e  l  v  e  s     a  n  d     t  h  e  i  r     a  u  t  h  o  r  ,     C  h  r  i  s  t  i  a  n  s     s  h  o  u  l  d     n  o  t     b  e     s  u  r  p  r  i  s  e  d     w  h  e  n     n  o  n  -  C  h  r  i  s  t  i  a  n  s     e  x  p  e  c  t     C  h  r  i  s  t  i  a  n  s  '     b  e  l  i  e  f  s     t  o     b  e     g  u  i  d  e  d     b  y     t  h  e     C  h  r  i  s  t  i  a  n  s  '     s  c  r  i  p  t  u  r  e  s     r  a  t  h  e  r     t  h  a  n     b  y     c  o  n  t  r  a  r  y     o  p  i  n  i  o  n  s  .  <  /  h  1  >
