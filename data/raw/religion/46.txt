One thing that has always struck me as odd is hearing the inerrancy of God's word preached but the apparent contradictions to this. One of the most prevalent issues with this is the fact that God said that he would both preserve his word as well as guide anyone who seeks him.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">People born and raised into opposing sects of Christianity and are very likely to never leave that particular sect. The differences between the denominations are often pretty trivial but sometimes they are matters of salvation and ideas intrinsic to "Christianity" itself.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">If God isn't concerned enough to correct those issues that could potentially send an individual to Hell, that would seem to be a direct contradiction to his word.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I had asked some pastor friends of mine this question and their responses were generally something to the tune of "leaning upon your own understanding of the bible often leads people to be misled" or even "Satan can use the scriptures themselves to lead people astray while they feel they are pursuing righteousness"</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This line of thinking is even more problematic because it  proves that either God is incapable of correcting his followers or he simply doesn't care to do so. Two people earnestly seeking God's guidance should not be able to get different answers to their questions and yet this happens all the time.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">At the very least this proves that versions of the Bible that claim God will guide those who seek him are not correct. Ultimately you cannot know for a fact that you yourself are doing God's will or being misled by something that feels exactly like "God's guidance" but is in fact a case of holy identity theft.</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  "  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  "  >  D  i  f  f  e  r  e  n  t     s  e  c  t  s     o  f     C  h  r  i  s  t  i  a  n  i  t  y     d  i  s  p  r  o  v  e     C  h  r  i  s  t  i  a  n  i  t  y  <  /  h  1  >
