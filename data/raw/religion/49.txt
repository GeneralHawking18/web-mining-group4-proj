The Trinity is apparently an awkward merging of two contradictory doctrines, and the crucifixion is apparently an awkward attempt to explain the death of a cult leader to his followers, but we should give Christianity the benefit of the doubt and ponder how the crucifixion might make sense if we assume that Christianity is really true and that Jesus was more than a merely human cult leader.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Here are some things that <a href="https://www.americantorah.com/2017/10/31/what-purpose-the-crucifixion/" class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">American Torah</a> has to say about the crucifixion:</p><blockquote class="_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Something has to cover (atone) our sins before we can approach God. A precise understanding of how atonement works is probably beyond our comprehension, but I think of it like neutralizing a bad odor. God can’t stomach our stench, so he sent Yeshua whose blood covers and removes it. His good odor becomes ours in God’s nostrils, hence the repeated description of sacrifices as “a pleasing aroma” to God.</p></blockquote><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Obviously this is meant as some sort of metaphor, but a metaphor for what? It seems to be ridiculous to think that an omniscient omnipresent God is not fully aware of everything at all times, so the notion of hiding anything from God is silly. God's omnipotence should allow God to hide things from himself if he so chooses, but that should be a simple act of his all-powerful will. If God does not want to see our sins, then God can simply not look at them, so this cannot explain the crucifixion.</p><blockquote class="_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Among other things, the Crucifixion satisfied the requirement of the Law for the death of the sinner, and the Resurrection established Yeshua’s permanent mastery of death.</p></blockquote><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Yet surely it must be God who makes the law, since God is omnipotent. Why would God make a law that would require someone's torturous death? And what could be the purpose of establishing Yeshua's mastery of death? These questions are courtesies in respect for the slim chance that someone might have an answer, because otherwise it is quite obvious that an all-loving and good God would <em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE">not</em> make a law that requires anyone to suffer a torturous death.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The crucifixion is not a reasonable expectation based upon Christian theology. It seems the crucifixion is only a part of Christian theology because the Romans crucified Jesus, and Jesus's followers had no choice but to try to make sense of that event. It had nothing to do with God, and Christians have never been able to give a good explanation for it, and so it has become one of the most obvious clues that Christianity is false. It is nothing more than a religion that grew out of the cult that Jesus originally started.</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  "  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  "  >  T  h  e     C  r  u  c  i  f  i  x  i  o  n     m  a  k  e  s     n  o     s  e  n  s  e     i  f     C  h  r  i  s  t  i  a  n  i  t  y     i  s     t  r  u  e  .  <  /  h  1  >
