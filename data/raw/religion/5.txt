For this one just taking the "intelligent" aspect. All the evidence we have so far shows that intelligence comes either A) from a creator (like a computer A.I.) or B) after an incredibly long and complex process. Neither of these are compatible with beginning everything. So for us to take the claim god is intelligent seriously we would need:</p><ol class="_1eJr7K139jnMstd4HajqYP"><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Evidence of what made god or</p></li><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Evidence of the gradual process that created god or</p></li><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Evidence of some other way that god could be intelligent that isn't simple yet another unsupported claim ("He's intelligent because he's DEFINED as intelligent!")</p></li></ol><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">It's the same way with any miracle claim.
