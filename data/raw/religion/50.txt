I'm not saying every Protestant group has this  issue. However, it seems that Some of them do. What do I mean by  'extreme modesty" I mean "Modesty" in many areas of life where it seems  modesty would not be required or to be excessive. Nietzsche said that  Christians suffer from extreme piety but in my opinion it seems that  Some Protestants suffer from "extreme modesty."</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Bare  in mind, you can be "Culturally Protestant" or "Culturally from X"  religion despite not being attending Church nor having a religious  belief. Just by virtue of being from that city or state. Some of these  examples might apply more to American culture by I have also seen a bit  of these <em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE">"modesty culture"</em> in Germany and the UK.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">*My  argument is the following: It seems Catholic or former Catholic  countries have a concept of "Sensuality" this has to do with  "expression" and "expressing yourself" and "feelings" meanwhile it seems  in Protestants countries there seems to be "modesty" plus a concept of  embarassment "*verlegenheit."</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Of  course, some people might say my examples are not strong enough but I  think they are a "microcosm" of a large structural culture which is  somewhat invisible unless you studying  in more depth: Calvinism,  Lutheranism and Evangelism.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Example #1(Concrete Example)</strong></p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Say  you buy a nice shirt for yourself. It seems that some "Protestants"  will find it "Pretentious." This could also be a English thing, like an  England vs France reason. But I have this type of talk in German as  well.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Example #2(Real example:Music)</strong></p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">There  was a Mexican Girl(Culturally Catholic) who gave Drake Bell a hug/kiss  and their English speaking audience, was shocked. They said, "Where are  your morals." Or "Why is she so shameless."</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Example # 3(Real Example:Television)</strong></p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I  have been watching a lot of Italian television and noticed that the  character will say something. Then regret it and apologize. But they are  much more "expressive" of emotion. I heard the English Speaking  audience say they are "Drama Queens"</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Example #4(Real Example: Soccer)</strong></p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The  American Soccer Coach wears a plain t-shirt. While many of the Soccer  Coaches in Europe wear suits. Now some people say that its his personal  choice. However, I believe he is "Culturally Protestant" since in a  previous thread some of you said "Protestants" shun upon wearing  "ostentatious clothes" since its draws your attention away from God.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Example #5(Celebrity Culture)</strong></p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Emma  Watson and many other celebrities are always trying to be modest, even  to the point where it sounds unrealistic. Some people said that audience  will "dislike" them if they started giving more honest answers.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Example #6(Conversations)</strong></p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Closely  related to #5, I noticed that in France and Italy people talk more  about "Intellectual" topics and you can name dropped thinkers. While in  the Protestant countries this would be "unfriendly" and "pretentious." I  am still studying German Culture in more depth hence, I can't guarantee  it happens there as well but I have see it in the English Speaking  Countries.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Conclusions</strong>:  There are just a few examples, I could go on and on. But you guys get  the idea. I wonder if there's someone who has written about this topic  in depth?</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  "  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  "  >  I  t     s  e  e  m     S  o  m  e     P  r  o  t  e  s  t  a  n  t  s     s  u  f  f  e  r     f  r  o  m     "  e  x  t  r  e  m  e     m  o  d  e  s  t  y  "  <  /  h  1  >
