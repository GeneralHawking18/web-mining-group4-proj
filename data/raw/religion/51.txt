Permitting slavery is immoral.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">P2. God permitted slavery.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">C. Therefore, God is immoral.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">For argument’s sake, let us assume that slavery is where the master owns the slave against their will, not something like indentured servitude, and something that the Christian God allowed in the Old Testament.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This leaves a logically valid argument, P2 as true, and P1 as the only premise to attack, so let us object to P1.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">P1 Refutation:</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">An action’s moral status depends on the moral agent’s knowledge of the action’s consequences.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">For example, if one goes up to somebody walking on the train tracks and pushes them down for no reason, then they have obviously acted immorally. The person pushed risks getting hurt for no reason.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">However, if the pusher has knowledge of an oncoming train and knows the consequences of pushing the person will save their life, then they have acted morally.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">So, it seems clear that an action’s morality is at least somewhat determined by their knowledge of consequences.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This serves as a dual objection to SA since it has implications for 1) the person making the argument and 2) if God can morally allow seemingly immoral actions.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">First, just like our friends knowledge of the oncoming train justified them pushing the person off the tracks, God’s foreknowledge could justify Him in allowing slavery (or you can swap out any seemingly immoral deed). You’ll notice in the OT passages God never comes out and says “Hey, it’s a great idea to allow slavery; the concept of one of you owning the other and treating them badly is a great thing for everyone, etc.” It’s more like He tolerates and sets rules around it given the situations.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Second, even if God did act immorally by allowing slavery, the one making the argument SA is in no position to know this. God could have a good reason for allowing it, like our friend had a good reason to push someone off the tracks. So even if the argument is sound, the one making it is just guessing and got lucky. They didn’t actually make a good argument (i.e., one based on knowledge).</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">In sum, SA’s proponent should reflect that if P1 is true, it is either necessarily true or possibly true. If SA’s proponent wants to say that P1 is necessarily true, then they need to show that God cannot have a justification for allowing it (an impossible task). If SA’s proponent wants to say that P1 is only possibly true, then the argument falls apart: the conclusion is then, weakly, that God is only possibly immoral (just like I possibly don’t exist).</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">SA’s proponent should also realize that my refutation’s form extends to any case where the arguer simply lacks the knowledge required to make the argument: hell is immoral, etc.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Lastly, we should recognize that my refutation is not simply restating that “God works in mysterious ways, we don’t know why He allowed slavery.” The refutation’s form completely neutralizes SA: at best, SA shows that God was possibly immoral (so what when possibilities come cheap?) At worst, SA does nothing (if SA’s proponent wants to take the road of saying that God couldn’t possibly have a good reason, which would require knowledge of the relevant consequences, which SA’s proponent can never have).</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  "  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  "  >  T  h  e     S  l  a  v  e  r  y     P  r  o  b  l  e  m  :     a  n     E  p  i  s  t  e  m  i  c     S  o  l  u  t  i  o  n  <  /  h  1  >
