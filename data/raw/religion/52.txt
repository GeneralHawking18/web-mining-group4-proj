There is an unspecified punishment for beating a slave to death, but said punishment likely isn't death, given how the Bible is hardly shy about explicitly naming death as the penalty for a wide variety of other actions.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Given that gay sex would result in the participants being executed, whereas a slaveowner buying someone and abusing them into submission would result in no punishment whatsoever so long as the slave doesn't die, it seems abundantly clear that the Bible paints gay sex as being worse than enslaving human beings.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Now, what's more likely?</p><ol class="_1eJr7K139jnMstd4HajqYP"><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The universe was created by a homophobic slaver god who passed these edicts down to us from on high</p></li><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The god of the Bible was created by homophobic slaver humans in their own image, just as humans have created thousands of other gods in their own image.</p></li></ol><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I consider option 2 far, far more likely to be true.</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  "  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  "  >  T  h  e     B  i  b  l  e     t  r  e  a  t  s     h  o  m  o  s  e  x  u  a  l  i  t  y     w  o  r  s  e     t  h  a  n     s  l  a  v  e  r  y  .  <  /  h  1  >
