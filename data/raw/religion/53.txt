I'd love to know what this common phrase actually <em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE">means</em>.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I've been inspired by several different events/situations/people in my life to then produce some artistic representation, be it a song, a poem, a photograph, a picture, a machinima, whatever. (all, I have to say, to a very amateur standard!), but the outcome of each of them was produced from my own mind and my own highly personal and subjective interpretation.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">One of the things we love about all forms of art including literature, is the subjective and personal spin on common human feelings, emotions and experiences.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">When claims are made the bible is divinely inspired, does this mean what I have described above? Or is god inspiring to a point he is actually making sure that what is written is what he <em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE">wanted</em> written?</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Does it just mean the writer was inspired by the <em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE">idea</em> of god, or inspired by previous writers?</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Did god actually send an angel to tell Abraham to go and slaughter his son or did he whisper into someone's ear to write a story about it, or was the writer 'inspired' by the idea of a deity doing something along those lines?</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">To claim that an understanding was inspired by god, implies that this understanding is correct, without any discussion of how this took place, what personal spin was put on the inspiration by the writer, it comes across as 'have your cake and eat it' writ large, any errors or sections that (a few thousand years later) are shown to be unpalatable to us are written off as 'yeah, human error, god only <em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE">inspired</em> it, he didn't write it, but the rest is true, trust me bro'.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">If 'inspiring' is the process by which the bible was written, it is <em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE">worse</em> than letting us just figure shit out for ourselves. It places a stamp of authority and veracity over works that have been tainted by highly personal subjectivity, a published work where the editor, the publisher, the proof-reader and the procurer wash their hands of all responsibility of error, fully happy to claim ownership of anything within that meets approval, and anything else becomes 'nuffin to do wiv me guv'.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Divine inspiration is a terrible process to publish ideas that are important to humanity.</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  "  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  "  >  D  i  v  i  n  e     i  n  s  p  i  r  a  t  i  o  n     i  s     a     t  e  r  r  i  b  l  e     p  r  o  c  e  s  s     t  o     p  u  b  l  i  s  h     i  d  e  a  s     t  h  a  t     a  r  e     i  m  p  o  r  t  a  n  t     t  o     h  u  m  a  n  i  t  y  <  /  h  1  >
