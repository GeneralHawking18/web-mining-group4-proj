There are some arguments we probably can't agree on, like the moral argument or the cosmological argument. Let's not talk about those (I'm not talking about those) <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">someone</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">is</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">going</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">to</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">respond</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">just</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">to</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">this</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">first</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">sentence</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">and</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">want</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">to</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">talk</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">about</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">those</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">I</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">promise,</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">and</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">it's</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">gonna</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">be</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">hilarious.</sup> Let's focus just on the arguments that everyone who is even vaguely reasonable, pretty much knows are bad.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">If you just reject those arguments (certain terms and conditions apply, I explain more below). You end up rejecting... kinda everything. Like, the sheer number of dumb christian arguments, created a wall of skepticism that is too high for almost any other belief to climb over. Nothing else (or almost nothing else) meets the standard of simply "doing better" than these bad arguments in favor of Christianity. Mostly because we just don't spend a lot of time justifying and rationalizing the majority of the things we believe on a day to day basis) Here are some of the arguments I can think of:</p><ul class="_33MEMislY0GAlB78wL1_CR"><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Argument from (biased) Authority:</strong> My parents, or my pastor, or someone I trust told me to be a Christian, and I did, and I liked it so I never went back.

I think we can all agree that these are bad arguments. I have phrased them humorously for the sake of readability, but I don't think it's a strawman because even more seriously worded variants just don't work. You shouldn't believe things just because someone told you, or because it makes you happy, or because you read it in a book that the idea literally comes from. Right? Right?</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I WANT to reject all of these reasons. I WANT these to be bad arguments. But what happens to my thought life if I reject every idea that is supported by one or more of these bad arguments? What do I have left that i can think is good, or commit to, or believe in, if I reject:</p><ul class="_33MEMislY0GAlB78wL1_CR"><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Anything that I believe or do only because someone I trusted said so (and I haven't gone and checked it out extensively in an objective and impartial way)</p></li><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Anything that I believe or do just because I tried it and liked it</p></li><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Anything I believe or do because I heard good things</p></li><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Anything I believe or do just in case something terrible (but improbable) happens, to cover my butt</p></li><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Anything I believe or do just because I want to</p></li><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Anything I believe or do because I worry I would indulge bad habits otherwise</p></li><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Anything I believe or do because a book about believing or doing it endorses believing or doing it</p></li><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Anything I can't remember why I believe or do, but I was sure at the time</p></li><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Anything I believe or do just because I always have</p></li><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Anything I believe or do because I prefer it to the alternatives I know about</p></li><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Anything I believe or do just cuz</p></li></ul><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Like.... those arguments were so puny and insignificant a minute ago. But now what can I justify?</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Consider a statement like "Exercise is good for you" How would I go about defending that? Well, doctors and personal trainers and gym teachers all agree... but they are all obviously biased in favor of exercise. I can try it and feel myself getting healthier, but that's subjective. I have lots of anecdotes... But if you ask me to prove it... I can't.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I think a choice of religion is a big choice that affects a lot of life socially and otherwise, so it's a lot like nationality. How would I defend a statement like "I (should continue to) live in the USA" Well, my friends and family are here, I've just sorta always lived here. I was born here. If I left I don't know where I would go... I don't have a good answer.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Why do I think Android is better than iPhone, or that the Longhorns are better than the Aggies. I dunno. I just sorta DO!</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I suspect a lot of you will spout off about "Extraordinary claims" and I hear you. But it seems to me that these arguments aren't just insufficient for extraordinary claims, they are actually dumb for any claim. Even so, what would be an extraordinary claim that I have accepted on the basis of extraordinary evidence? How about "There used to be a race of giant lizards that roamed the planet called Dinosaurs" Okay. Where? I've never seen one. Even the bones I saw at the museum were literally fake. They told me at the museum they had fake bones on display and the real bones were hidden somewhere.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Even concepts like "I Exist" are really really really hard to justify. Like, I've read Descartes, "I think therefore I am" but that's literally the John 3:16 of the book on justifying I exist. How many books have I read on the possibility that I might not exist? And maybe I exist in some form, but is the person I call "me" actually accurate? Am I the same person I remember being as a child? Is the image I have in my head of myself the same person who actually IS? How the hell would I know?</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Is there ANYTHING that anyone here can actualy justify without appealing to one or more of these dumb reasons? I leave open the possibility that there may be one or two things, but I can't think of them. And there certainly aren't enough to live a functional life.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">We've gotten so good at debunking, we seem to have entirely lost track of how to "bunk".</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Terms and Conditions: <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">*When</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">I</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">say</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">"reject</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">these</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">arguments'</sup> ' <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">I</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">mean</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">to</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">imply</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">that</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">you</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">reject</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">them</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">all.</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">And</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">you</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">reject</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">them</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">unilaterally:</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">that</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">is,</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">you</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">reject</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">them</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">on</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">the</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">basis</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">that</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">they</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">are</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">just</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">stupid</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">and</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">bad</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">and</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">not</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">a</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">good</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">way</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">to</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">determing</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">what</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">to</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">believe</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">in,</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">instead</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">of</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">rejecting</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">them</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">in</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">some</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">specific</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">contextual</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">way</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">for</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">why</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">that</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">specific</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">argument</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">does</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">not</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">apply</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">to</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">that</sup> <sup class="_1jsgSPRO0cMQfs1UZrSovE">specific.*</sup></p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">CONCLUSION: I dunno nothing really. I just think it's interesting. I believe a lot of us on these forums think of ourselves as hardened skeptics, even the Christians, who don't abide bad arguments. But we totally do in most areas of our lives. It doesn't mean Christianity is true or false or atheism is true or false.
