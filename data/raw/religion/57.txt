<div class="_3xX726aBn29LDbsDtzr_6E _1Ap4F5maDtT1E1YuCiaO0r D3IL3FD0RFy_mkKLPwL4" style="max-width:800px" data-click-id="text" data-adclicklocation="media"><div class="_292iotee39Lmt0MkQZ2hPV RichTextJSON-root"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Often, when Genesis is called out on its bullshit or how Noah's flood never happened or other areas where the Bible says something that very clearly didn't happen. Lots of people say things like "the Bible isn't a science textbook" or "its a metaphor" or similar.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The problem with that is why <em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE">isn't</em> the Bible a science textbook? Why did God not start the book with an accurate and detailed account of the start of our universe? Why didn't he write a few books outlining basic physics chemistry and biology? Probably would be more helpful than anything in the back half of the Old Testament. If God really wanted what was best for us, he probably should've written down how diseases spread and how to build proper sanitation systems and vaccines. Jews (and I presume some Christians, but I have only ever heard Jews say this) love to brag about how the Torah demands we wash our hands before we eat as if that is proof of divine inspiration, but it would've been a lot more helpful if God expalined <em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE">why</em> to do that. We went through 1000s of years of thinking illness was demonic possession, it would have helped countless people if we could've skipped that and go straight to modern medicine or beyond.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">If the point of the Bible is to help people, why does it not include any actually useful information. It's not like the Bible is worried about brevity. If the Bible was actually divinely inspired and it was concerned with helping people, it would be, at least in part, a science textbook.</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  "  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  "  >  T  h  e     B  i  b  l  e     s  h  o  u  l  d     b  e     a     s  c  i  e  n  c  e     t  e  x  t  b  o  o  k  <  /  h  1  >
