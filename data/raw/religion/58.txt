In this post my aim is to demonstrate the issues with Baha’i attempts to reconcile the two. To organize my thoughts, my ‘opening statement’ if you will is this;</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Modern Baha’i apologia emphasizes two points in order to make its stance on homosexuality palatable to liberal sensibilities. The first is that the Faith “hates the sin not the sinner” and one is free to be a homosexual Baha’i so long as they remain ‘publicly’ celibate. The second is to argue that the Faith does not impose its stances on non-Baha’is.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I feel that these two points are legitimately believed by most Baha’is, however I believe both are fundamentally incompatible with the philosophy outlined by the authoritative figures of the Faith for two reasons.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The first is that the Faith does not recognize homosexuality as a legitimate identity, instead viewing it as an aberration which can and should be cured. While in terms of administrative sanction the Faith does not advocate for actively seeking out ‘celibate’ homosexuals for reprimand or intervention philosophically this is exactly what the Faith actually advocates and is what the teachings expect of homosexuals joining the community.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The second is that the Faith’s explicit aim is to assume governance of society and it explicitly rejects the idea that the Faith will not impose Baha’i laws on society at some point in the future.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Before supporting my arguments as some background, I should note that while in most religious traditions it is entirely incorrect to make blanket statements about what a religious “is” or what it believes based on administrative communications, however the structure of the Baha’i Faith is such that its entire belief system is defined by its administrative communications with disagreement and reformation not really being possible. In the Will and Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Baha the following open mandate is given to the two bodies which I will draw most of my quotations from:</p><blockquote class="_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">“The sacred and youthful branch, the Guardian of the Cause of God, as well as the Universal House of Justice, to be universally elected and established, are both under the care and protection of the Abhá Beauty, under the shelter and unerring guidance of the Exalted One (may my life be offered up for them both). Whatsoever they decide is of God. Whoso obeyeth him not, neither obeyeth them, hath not obeyed God; whoso rebelleth against him and against them hath rebelled against God; whoso opposeth him hath opposed God; whoso contendeth with them hath contended with God; whoso disputeth with him hath disputed with God; whoso denieth him hath denied God; whoso disbelieveth in him hath disbelieved in God; whoso deviateth, separateth himself and turneth aside from him hath in truth deviated, separated himself and turned aside from God. May the wrath, the fierce indignation, the vengeance of God rest upon him!” -<a href="https://www.bahai.org/library/authoritative-texts/abdul-baha/will-testament-abdul-baha/2#189137811" class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank"> https://www.bahai.org/library/authoritative-texts/abdul-baha/will-testament-abdul-baha/2#189137811</a></p></blockquote><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">So the above demonstrates that the Faith as it defines itself deems disagreeing with a statement of the Guardian or the Universal House of Justice to be disagreeing with God and being an action worthy of incurring his vengeance. Actively disagreeing with the philosophy of these bodies is punishable by excommunication and shunning, as such I feel I am justified in defining the views of the ‘Baha’i Faith’ solely by the quotes below.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">With that preamble out of the way, here is a quote from a 1987 letter of the UHJ I feel debunks the argument that a homosexual can be a Baha’i, they are merely asked to be celibate:</p><blockquote class="_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">“...the Faith does not recognize homosexuality as a "natural" or permanent phenomenon. Rather, it sees this as an aberration subject to treatment, however intractable exclusive homosexuality may now seem to be. To the question of alteration of homosexual bents, much study must be given, and doubtless in the future clear principles of prevention and treatment will emerge. As for those now afflicted, a homosexual does not decide to be a problem human, but he does, as you rightly state, have decision in choosing his way of life, i.e. abstaining from homosexual acts.” -<a href="https://bahai-library.com/compilation_homosexuality_bwc#s1" class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank"> https://bahai-library.com/compilation_homosexuality_bwc#s1</a></p></blockquote><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This I feel establishes that the idea that homosexual Baha’is are fully accepted, they are just asked not to act on their desires, is an untenable position to hold without disagreeing with the UHJ. Here they explicitly say that it is an aberration which must be treated and authoritatively pronounce that homosexuality does not have a natural cause. They also advocate for research into conversion therapy, and the argument of Baha’is that homosexuals are only expected to be celibate is shown to be temporary. The UHJ says that “for those now afflicted”, I emphasize the word NOW.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Once these principles of prevention and treatment have hypothetically emerged is the stance of the Baha’i Faith that homosexuals will have the choice of whether to maintain their aberration while being celibate? I believe this 1993 letter of the UHJ provides an answer in the negative:</p><blockquote class="_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">“ In consideration of the questions raised

expected to overcome their affliction.If we read this quote with the context that the UHJ has stated that principles for preventing and treating/curing homosexuality will be developed I do not believe it is a stretch to say that the UHJ is saying that homosexuals who become Baha’is will be expected to undertake whatever methods they devise to cure homosexuality in the future. The 1987 quote clearly states that homosexuality is an aberration which is to be treated, then makes a distinction between homosexuality and homosexual acts in order to state that while homosexuality can not currently be treated abstaining from homosexual acts is the only course of action to be taken. Clearly the objection in the 1987 letter is in fact to homosexuality as a state of being, and not merely with acting on homosexual impulses.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">With that out of the way, I would like to address the second Baha’i point, that Baha’i law will only apply to Baha’is. I will state in advance I feel there is more room to disagree with my argument on why this is invalid.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The crux of my view that the Baha’i Faith explicitly aims to impose its laws is a 1995 letter in which the UHJ explicitly states that the Baha’i Faith does not believe in separation of church and state (apologies for wall of text, but feel a shorter excerpt would remove too much context):</p><blockquote class="_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">“You also ask how these statements could be reconciled with Shoghi Effendi’s comment on page 149 of Bahá’í Administration, which appears to anticipate “a future that is sure to witness the formal and complete separation of Church and State,” and with the following words in his letter of 21 March 1932 addressed to the Bahá’ís of the United States and Canada:</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Theirs is not the purpose, while endeavoring to conduct and perfect the administrative affairs of their Faith, to violate, under any circumstances, the provisions of their country’s constitution, much less to allow the machinery of their administration to supersede the government of their respective countries.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">A careful reading of the letter dated 6 December 1928 in which the Guardian’s comment about the separation of Church and State occurs would suggest that, rather than enunciating a general principle, Shoghi Effendi is simply reviewing “the quickening forces of internal reform” that had “recently transpired throughout the Near and Middle East,” and enumerating a number of factors that impinge on the development of the Faith in those parts of the world.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">As for the statement made by Shoghi Effendi in his letter of 21 March 1932, the well-established principles of the Faith concerning the relationship of the Bahá’í institutions to those of the country in which the Bahá’ís reside make it unthinkable that they would ever purpose to violate a country’s constitution or so to meddle in its political machinery as to attempt to take over the powers of government. This is an integral element of the Bahá’í principle of abstention from involvement in politics. However, this does not by any means imply that the country itself may not, by constitutional means, decide to adopt Bahá’í laws and practices and modify its constitution or method of government accordingly. The relationship between the principle of abstention from involvement in politics and the emergence of the Bahá’í State is commented on later in this letter. In the meantime we can quote the following extracts from letters written on behalf of the Guardian in response to queries from individual believers, which indicate that the relationship is an evolving one:” - &gt;<a href="https://www.bahai.org/library/authoritative-texts/the-universal-house-of-justice/messages/19950427_001/1#267741950" class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">https://www.bahai.org/library/authoritative-texts/the-universal-house-of-justice/messages/19950427_001/1#267741950</a></p></blockquote><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">While the Faith does not seek to impose its views through partisan politics (and thankfully for homosexuals is likely never going to achieve the scenario outlined above) it does want to see a future in which constitutions are rewritten to adopt Baha’i laws and principles. This is a positive in regards to rights of women and resolving racial prejudice, but I believe I have demonstrated above that due to the UHJ’s official philosophy this scenario would also lead to state sponsored conversion therapy being imposed.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Now the one objection which could hold water is that one could argue that while the UHJ condemns homosexuality as an aberration which must be suppressed temporarily until methods of eradicating it are developed, this could be classified as advice rather than a law. I believe the following quote from Shoghi Effendi debunks this reasoning as it establishes that the Baha’i Faith essentially considers homosexuality to be a crime as it is defined as a sanctionable offense:</p><blockquote class="_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">“Regarding the question you asked him about one of the believers who seems to be flagrantly homosexual -- although to a certain extent we must be forbearing in the matter of people's moral conduct because of the terrible deterioration in society in general, this does not mean that we can put up indefinitely with conduct which is disgracing the Cause. The person should have it brought to his attention that such acts are condemned by Bahá'u'lláh, and that he must mend his ways, if necessary consult doctors, and make every effort to overcome this affliction, which is corruptive for him and bad for the Cause. If after a period of probation you do not see an improvement, he should have his voting rights taken away. The Guardian does not think, however, that a Bahá'í body should take it upon itself to denounce him to the Authorities unless his conduct borders on insanity.” -<a href="https://bahai-library.com/compilation_homosexuality_bwc#s1" class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank"> https://bahai-library.com/compilation_homosexuality_bwc#s1</a></p></blockquote><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And while one may downplay removal of voting rights as a benign punishment Shoghi Effendi himself defined it as a harsh penalty (the harshest possible defined in Baha'i administrative guidance, with the exception of excommunication which is only for specifically challenging the structure of divine authority within the religion):</p><blockquote class="_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">"The general basis for the deprivation of voting rights is of course gross immorality and open opposition to the administrative functions of the Faith, and disregard for the laws of personal status; and even then it is the duty of the National Assembly, before exercising this sanction, to confer with the individuals involved in a loving manner to help them overcome the problem; second, to warn them that they must desist; third, to issue further warnings if the original warnings are not followed; and finally, if there seems no other way to handle the matter, then a person may be deprived of voting rights.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">"The Guardian however, wishes the National Assemblies to be very cautious in using this sanction, because it might be abused, and then lose its efficacy. It should be used only when there seems no other way to solve the problem.” -</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a href="https://bahai.works/Lights_of_Guidance/Administrative_Rights,_Sanctions,_Dissimulation" class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">https://bahai.works/Lights_of_Guidance/Administrative_Rights,_Sanctions,_Dissimulation</a></p></blockquote><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">In conclusion, while I think contemporary Baha’is wholeheartedly believe in their convictions of abolishing all prejudice and their arguments that the Baha’i Faith is not homophobic are made in good faith, their reasoning is based on ignorance of what the authoritative philosophy of the Baha’i administration is.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Based on the above I feel the Baha'i community as a whole is rather disingenuous (largely unintentionally) on the issue of sexuality, and it strikes me that individual Baha'is discussing sexuality put a huge amount of effort into being sensitive and empathic towards homosexuals while attempting to grapple with what their religion teaches, whereas the idealized 'infallible' figures of the Faith just made incredibly blunt statements about corruption and afflictions. It is an interesting phenomenon that a religious community feels the need to routinely alter the textual rhetoric of figures it considers to speak directly for God while also not feeling in any way that they are disagreeing with those figures. This is a particularly curious phenomenon  with respect to the Faith. The very centralized nature of its theological framework (with no views having any weight except the Central Figures, Guardian,  and UHJ) generally Baha'is dedicate themselves to utilizing meticulous direct quotation in making arguments, with perhaps the sole exception being discussions on homosexuality in which they will instead paraphrase and avoid direct quotations.</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  "  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  "  >  T  h  e     B  a  h  a  '  i     F  a  i  t  h  :     A     r  e  b  u  t  t  a  l     t  o     a  t  t  e  m  p  t  s     t  o     r  e  c  o  n  c  i  l  e     t  h  e     B  a  h  a  '  i     F  a  i  t  h     a  n  d     h  o  m  o  p  h  o  b  i  a     p  r  e  s  e  n  t     i  n     i  t  s     p  h  i  l  o  s  o  p  h  y  <  /  h  1  >
