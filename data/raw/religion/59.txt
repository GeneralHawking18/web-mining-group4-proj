<div class="_3xX726aBn29LDbsDtzr_6E _1Ap4F5maDtT1E1YuCiaO0r D3IL3FD0RFy_mkKLPwL4" style="max-width:800px" data-click-id="text" data-adclicklocation="media"><div class="_292iotee39Lmt0MkQZ2hPV RichTextJSON-root"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Earlier I posted about the double standard whereby religions and religious people promote extermination of LGTBQ+ people and consider it to be a "disagreement", whereas when queer people verbally criticize homophobic religious violence it is considered to be "bashing" and "attacking".</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Likewise, whenever and wherever LGBTQ+ people visibly exist, no matter what we do, we are accused of "grooming", but particularly in schools and places where children are taught.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Meanwhile these same people who are obsessed with convincing everyone that LGBTQ+ people are all groomer pedophiles have seemingly no issues with children being taught about Mary, a young child who was impregnated by a deity without her consent, and then groomed to accept it, and this is considered to be one of the greatest miracles of all time according to Christians.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Same with conservative Muslims. In Dearborn they're freaking out about the LGBTQ books that are allegedly "grooming" children, but have no issue with Aisha being groomed to be Mohammad's bride, or the offer of virgins in heaven. Apparently that's not grooming either, according to them.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And in Buddhism homosexuality is considered to be "misconduct" and conflated with various forms of sexual abuse that are also in theory disallowed <del>among clergy</del>. And yet when Buddhist teachers and clergy have turned out to be sexual predators and child rapists, higher ups have recommended that their abused students continue to treat the teachers with the same filial piety as always.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">***correction: As it turns out, it is not just clergy for whom gay sex is considered misconduct in Buddhism. Rather, the rule is considered to apply to all Buddhists, so it was worse than I thought. Sorry for misinforming!</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">*So in summation, to be clear, since religious people report having an interest in stopping abuse and violence (and since I and many others would certainly prefer that religious people not lie and slander LGBTQ+ people as groomers and perverts and advocate that we be executed) religions and religious people should therefore stop slandering us as groomers and advocating that we be executed and instead begin trying to mitigate the untold damage and abuse on a mass scale caused by institutions they affiliate with, abuses which include thousands and thousands of <em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">actual</strong></em> cases of violence and grooming, which were covered up and denied and ignored for as long as possible ...... Maybe deal with that instead of, like, showing up with armed thugs to threaten people for imaginary reasons at the school board meeting or the library during story time, if preventing actual abuse is indeed something that is of concern to you.</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  "  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  "  >  M  o  r  e     d  o  u  b  l  e     s  t  a  n  d  a  r  d  s     b  e  t  w  e  e  n     r  e  l  i  g  i  o  n  s     a  n  d     t  h  e     L  G  B  T  Q  +     c  o  m  m  u  n  i  t  y  <  /  h  1  >
