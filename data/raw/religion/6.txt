Sure. That's great. I have no argument with the statement save that it's incomplete.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">What it SHOULD mean is "There could be evidence <strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">but without that evidence this claim is HIGHLY unlikely to be true / as good as false.</strong>"</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Too often what it's implied to mean is, "There could be evidence and that should give some credence to this claim." It's a sort of scam; a way to try to make "evidence" be interchangeable with "possible evidence".</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This is not how reality works.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">"I can draw a square circle" does not become any less false if I word it, "There could be evidence I can draw a square circle."</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">If I say, "You (complete stranger reading this reddit post) owe me $50.00" do you feel any need to pay up if I word the claim as, "It's possible you owe me $50.00". Like sure. It's possible. But without empirical evidence it's not something you need to take seriously. And if I lean on that possibility like it counts as evidence then I'm just being a troll.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">It's the exact same way for religious claims.</strong> Insisting that this or that is possible when evidence is sorely needed is just a dishonest tactic to muddy the waters.</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  "  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  "  >  T  h  e     p  o  s  s  i  b  i  l  i  t  y     o  f     e  v  i  d  e  n  c  e     v  e  r  s  u  s     a  c  t  u  a  l     e  v  i  d  e  n  c  e  <  /  h  1  >
