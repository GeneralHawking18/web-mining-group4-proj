God never asks for Mary's consent. God simply takes control and causes Mary to become pregnate.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This is called RAPE. God RAPED Mary because God didn't ask Mary for her consent.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I don't understand how modern Christians can completely ignore this story.  This story is the worst story about rape that I have ever read.</p><hr class="_2ACwpV3Y0LKhHHKbsxNmmY"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">References:</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Luke 1:30-38:</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">30 And the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. 31 And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus. 32 He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David, 33 and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.”</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">34 And Mary said to the angel, “How will this be, since I am a virgin?”</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">35 And the angel answered her, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born[d] will be called holy—the Son of God. 36 And behold, your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son, and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren. 37 For nothing will be impossible with God.” 38 And Mary said, “Behold, I am the servant[e] of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word.” And the angel departed from her.</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  "  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  "  >  T  h  e     B  i  b  l  e     t  e  a  c  h  e  s     t  h  a  t     G  o  d     i  m  p  r  e  g  n  a  t  e  d     M  a  r  y     w  i  t  h  o  u  t     h  e  r     c  o  n  s  e  n  t  .
