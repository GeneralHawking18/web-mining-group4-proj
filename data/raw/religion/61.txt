For example, (and this will be my prime example) the story of the Exodus is completely without foundation. No authentic record of Egyptian antiquity ever records anything like the Exodus, and the Egyptian records that Christians point to as support of the Exodus either blatantly contradict the Bible, or they refer to something else that should be viewed in its own context. The point is,the Bible claims that extremely extravagant events happened in history, despite the fact that there is no evidence to support such an assertion. How can one believe that the Bible is god inspired, when it contains such  blatant myths?</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  "  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  "  >  T  h  e     B  i  b  l  e     i  s     h  i  s  t  o  r  i  c  a  l  l  y     i  n  a  c  c  u  r  a  t  e     a  n  d     t  h  e  r  e  f  o  r  e     n  o  t     t  h  e     w  o  r  d     o  f     G  o  d  .  <  /  h  1  >
