The evidence for this is that Mohammad, the individual who invented Islam, took a child bride when he was in his 50's. According to writings, he both married her and years later consummated the marriage before his wife's age could be counted in double digits. This is not an attack or an insult. This is a fact one can google. Aisha was married at 6 and then slept with her when she was 9.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Today, I would hope that modern day Muslims condemn the practice of child brides. I believe most do. Muslims are not awful people and by and large are quite peaceful. There's a lot that's good about them and even about their religion. However, I do not understand the mental gymnastics Muslims go through to reconcile condemning children brides versus the actions of their prophet. I do not understand how Muslims can claim morality is objective if something so clearly abhorrent was right for one person AND wrong for everyone else at the same time. Do I have it wrong? Do Muslims claim that morality is subjective?</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  "  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  "  >  M  o  d  e  r  n     d  a  y     M  u  s  l  i  m  s     c  a  n  n  o  t     m  a  k  e     c  l  a  i  m  s     t  o     a  b  s  o  l  u  t  e     m  o  r  a  l  i  t  y  .  <  /  h  1  >
