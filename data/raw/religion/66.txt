I felt like I needed a purpose in life. I’d go to youth group and the message of ‘God loves you and God has a purpose for you’, in addition to the music and group think..  really resonated with me to the point where I decided to beieve in Jesus/God. At this time in my life I didn’t know any ‘apologetical’ arguments for God’s existence besides stuff my youth pastor would say, such as: "how do you get something from nothing, how do you get order from chaos’”. I believed in Adam and Eve, a young earth, a young human species..ect. I have a speech impediment. I was aware that If you asked God to heal you, and if you earnestly asked it, he would. I asked him to heal it and he didn’t. I rationalized it with: maybe God wants to use what I have for his benefit, or maybe God has a better plan for me. My belief in God was based on a more psychological grounding involving being,  purpose, and rationalizations rather than evidence/reasoning, logic.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">It wasn’t until I went to college and learned about anthropology/human evolution where my beliefs about God became challeneged. An example was: “if The earth is billions of years old, and human are hundred thousands of years old, why does the timeline really only go back 6-10k years? The order of creation isn’t even scentifically correct. If we evolved, then we weren’t made from dust/clay... and there really wasn’t an Adam and Eve, and the house of cards began to fall.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The reason I bring this up is.. I feel when having ‘debates’ regarding which religion is true.. which religion has the best proofs.. the best evidence.. ect.. I feel the relgious side isn’’t being completely honest insofar as WHY they believe in God in the first place.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">It’s been my understanding, now as an Atheist, that ‘evidence/reason/logic’, whatever term you want to use, is only supplemented into the belief structure to support a belief that is based in emotion and psychological grounding. That’s why I’ve found it so difficult to debate Theists. If reason/evidence/logic is why you believe God exists, then showing you why your reason/logic/evidence is bad SHOULD convince you that you don’t have a good reason to believe in God. Instead, it doesn’t; the belief persists.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">So I ask, what is your fundamental reason for holding a belief in whatever religion you subscribe to? Is it truly based in evidence/reason/logic.. or are you comfortable with saying your religion may not be true, but believing it makes you feel good by filling an existential void in your life?</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  "  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  "  >  F  u  n  d  a  m  e  n  t  a  l     R  e  a  s  o  n     f  o  r     y  o  u  r     R  e  l  i  i  g  o  u  s     B  e  l  i  e  f  <  /  h  1  >
