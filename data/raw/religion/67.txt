This possibility allows the universe to exist without a god.</p></li><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Things that exist cannot be eternal, but do need a cause to begin existing. If this is true, there is no evidence to suggest that this cause would have to be a god, but even if it did, it also means that something else had to cause god to exist, and something had to cause that to exist which obviously leads to an infinite regression. So for the theist, either, infinite regression is a problem and god suffers from it just as much as anything else, or infinite regression is not a problem and god doesnt have to exist anywhere in the chain. It simply cannot be had both ways.</p></li><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Things can simply begin to exist without cause, this eliminates the problem of infinite regression, but also pretty obviously allows the universe to exist without god.</p></li></ol><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I would also posit that any possible objection in favor of god necessarily relies on a special pleading fallacy, and can be rejected.</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  "  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  "  >  T  h  e     “  P  r  o  b  l  e  m  ”     o  f     S  o  m  e  t  h  i  n  g     C  o  m  i  n  g     F  r  o  m     N  o  t  h  i  n  g     i  s     a     T  e  r  r  i  b  l  e     A  r  g  u  m  e  n  t     f  o  r     G  o  d  <  /  h  1  >
