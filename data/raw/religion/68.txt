How can i prove this? I’ve sinned but i don’t remember committing my first sin, nor do i remember it being a sin, therefore i’m being judged for something i wasn’t even aware of which sucks extraordinarily! The point is god gave us two sinners for parents to teach us right from wrong and will judge us accordingly, that make no sense! Jesus’s parents were wise and firm and he turned out sinless and perfect yet i get a trailer park redneck “mom” who is an alcoholic that hooks up for a fix and beat her childrens and i gotta try to find the lord all while i fight her drug addict lover and try to save my siblings from being murdered, at this point i realized why millions of people suicide, not everyone is fit to live yet are forced to live by god for his glory which left me amazed considering he is just a random cosmic entity that we’ve never even met! Anyway what do yall think?</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  "  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  "  >  g  o  d     g  a  v  e     u  s     s  i  n  n  e  r     p  a  r  e  n  t  s  <  /  h  1  >
