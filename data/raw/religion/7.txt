But most likely space and time don't figure at a fundamental level.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Yet, for some reason, the magnitude and the expansive nature of these frameworks are brought into play to say how insignificant we are to the universe in the bigger scheme of things or derive philosophical conclusions based on an onthology that is misleading</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">In fact, i would argue that the fine tuning of the universe and the fact that we can understand it means that life could play a bigger role than we imagine. And this doesn't come from a religious perspective. There are very strong philosophical and scientific indications that an universe witouth someone to perceive it would  look very different or not exist altogether, as many modern physicists would claim. There sre not cranks or new age hippies we are talking about.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The problem is these ideas have not reached yet the public consciousness in a big way. Most people still conceptualize the universe as a very big place where we just apoeared randomly on some corner. However, there might be more interdependence than we think between us and 'what is out there' so it is very premature and naive to draw philosophical conclusions based on current undetstanding.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I guess the bigger picture i'm trying to get across is that science is not a good guide for telling truths about what ultimate reality might be and the role we play in the universe. So many people nowdays think science is or will be able to provide answers to foundational questions humans have been asking since the beginning, thus falling into scientism. But, at the end of the day, we are still stuck with philosophy and religion, all coming down to a jump of faith.</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  "  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  "  >  S  c  i  e  n  c  e     c  a  n  '  t     e  v  e  n     t  e  l  l     w  h  a  t     s  p  a  c  e     n  o  r     t  i  m  e     a  r  e     a  n  d     y  e  t     t  h  e  s  e     n  o  t  i  o  n  s     a  r  e     b  r  o  u  g  h  t     t  o     c  l  a  i  m     h  o  w     i  n  s  i  g  n  i  f  i  c  a  n  t     h  u  m  a  n  s     a  r  e  <  /  h  1  >
