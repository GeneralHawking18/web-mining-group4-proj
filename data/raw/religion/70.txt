If the teachings or scripture of a religion doesn't align with observable facts, then those teachings or scriptures are actually in disagreement with God.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">One could make the argument that our methods of observing and interacting with reality are subject to limitations and therefore fallible, but we rely on our ability to observe, make judgments, and react to our environment to stay alive everyday. If you are alive to read this, these abilities and skills have been successful so far.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">So unless God is deliberately trying to trick you into disbelief, why not rely on the objective reality that God created to judge the scriptures and teachings that have come from fallible humans?</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  "  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  "  >  T  h  e     T  e  a  c  h  i  n  g  s     o  f     A  n  y     T  r  u  e     R  e  l  i  g  i  o  n     M  u  s  t     A  l  i  g  n     W  i  t  h     O  b  j  e  c  t  i  v  e     F  a  c  t  s     a  n  d     S  c  i  e  n  c  e  .  <  /  h  1  >
