If purgatorial universalism is true, I may have to go to hell for a bit or wait in purgatory for a bit then I'll go to heaven anyway. If annihilationism is true I will maybe suffer for a bit but eventually, be eternally destroyed and cease to exist. All these viewpoints of Hell pale in comparison to eternal conscious torment. ECT means that I would be suffering in a lake of fire under maximum physical and mental agony forever and ever without end due to coming to the incorrect conclusion on the gospel. ECT makes accepting the gospel the most significant act a human being can do without any possible terms of comparison due to the consequences of not doing so. Most importantly if ECT is true every Christian that says ECT is not true will be doing unbelievers a disservice and may be liable to God for not adequately warning us of the severity of the consequences of rejecting Jesus.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Assumption-Hell exists, and it is eternal conscious torment</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">If that assumption is correct, it's good to be saved and to be sure of your salvation. How can Christians be sure of their salvation due to contradictory assertions on salvation? Some say you have to speak in tongues, or you will burn in hell, some say you must live a life of holiness and repentance, and any declaration of faith in Christ, or the gospel is meaningless unless backed up by a holy lifestyle, many say lifestyle doesn't matter all you have to do is accept Jesus.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Someone who is convinced that Jesus is their Lord and Saviour, and the gospel is true and fails to live a holy lifestyle could face ECT for being lukewarm and failing to TRULY accept the gospel through their lifestyle. This shows that incorrect theology even amongst Christians can be the difference between ECT and eternal life.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">That's why I think it's unreasonable to claim that theological differences between hell and salvation are trivial when they could be the difference between ECT and eternal life.</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  "  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  "  >  C  h  r  i  s  t  i  a  n     t  h  e  o  l  o  g  i  c  a  l     d  i  f  f  e  r  e  n  c  e  s     o  n     h  e  l  l     a  n  d     s  a  l  v  a  t  i  o  n     a  r  e     N  O  T     t  r  i  v  i  a  l  <  /  h  1  >
