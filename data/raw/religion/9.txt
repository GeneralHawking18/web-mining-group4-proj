Many of those religions contradict each other. They ALL cannot be correct. While belief by blind faith is enough for Theists, that is not a logical reason for anyone to believe anything. Evidence is required.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Science has given us theories about the origin of our universe that we can debate over forever.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Why isn't the default position for every person simply, "I don't know."</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">We don't know how or why the universe came about. In fact, there are so many unknowns that anyone taking any one single position seems unreasonable. "I don't know" can only be the one correct answer.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">It is true that over time and as technology advances we are able to make new discoveries that answers some of those unknowns, but is it truly possible that we can ever answer the most important of these questions?</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I am not suggesting that everyone should take an agnostic approach (I consider myself an Atheist), but I am curious to see what other people have to say about this.</p></div></div>  <  h  1     c  l  a  s  s  =  "  _  e  Y  t  D  2  X  C  V  i  e  q  6  e  m  j  K  B  H  3  m  "  >  T  h  e     D  e  f  a  u  l  t     "  I     d  o  n  '  t     k  n  o  w  "  <  /  h  1  >
